| 0:01:11| First and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=71)|

| 0:01:54| Consideration of suspension or revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| Corner Market, 7512 O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Sevierville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Esfail Ishmael, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:47| Sir, I need you to please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Esfail Ishmael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| And what is the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| 7512 O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Sevierville Park, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| And the name of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| The Corner Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:15| U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Can you tell the Board what we're here on with regard to this and provide the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| The Sheriff's Office is the one that paid the sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Sheriff's Department of Fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Yes, at 7512, the Corner Market on O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Sevierville Park, Zane Ishmael was cited into court for the sale of beer to an underage officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| and he was put on the first offender program through juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| He was 16 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| This occurred on the 15th of May, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=234)|
| 0:04:03| Had it happened previously in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| I'm showing here April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| This is the only time that it's happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| With him being the owner, I think this was the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| On these citations, it's taken about five months to go through court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| So it could very well be April or they probably sum up in the office that they got it the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| It just takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Mr. Ishmael, is this the only time that you have been cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Do you concur with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Commissioner Hammondtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| I'm Hammondtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| I'm Hammondtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Sir, this is your son that did this, and he's 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Has he been through training to know how to do this or what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| No, because that day he just came to pick me up while I was in the restroom, and he attended the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| We were not supposed to do that, but what's happened that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| I'm wondering what happens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| I mean, is he going through some training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Because, I mean, since he's your son, you obviously want him involved in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| But I'm wondering, is there additional training that will need to be done here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| It's scheduled for the community services end of this month, and we have a court date of next month, September 6, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| He's not allowed to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| He's been 16 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Well, that was another question I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| What age do you have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Is it 18, 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| That was going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Obviously, he's underage and is not allowed to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| So I guess, is this a first offense or a second offense or a third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Now, Mr. Monick, you had stated that the third offense is when we can do suspension and revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| So this is the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Would, obviously, selling to a minor would count as one offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| And then a minor selling beer, would that count as a second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Commissioner, our rules, I believe, says first offense is $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| But you all can do, you can do anything that the board votes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| You could suspend his license, fine him $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| I'm just saying what our beer laws, but you're welcome to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| And I believe the law department would have to back you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Mr. Ismail, how long have you had this license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| About eight months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Eight months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| And were you the only one that went through training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| No, I have one of the part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| That, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Let me read real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Here's what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Or, of course, like what U.K. says, you can do more than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| On your first offense, 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Second offense, like you were saying, Commissioner Davis, do you want to count this as two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Second offense, and if it's within 36 months of the first, be 60-day suspension and a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:57| Or you can do one, the 60-day or the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Any other offense, up to 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| So those are some of the guidelines that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Mr. Chairman, my light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Oh, I can't see from the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I wanted to ask Mr. Ismail a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Does your son normally work at the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| He does not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Never?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| He does come and pick me up sometimes because I have health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| So I have to open and close all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| So once I get tired, I call him to come and pick me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| And he come help me closing the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| He never serve or run the register or sell anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| So what did you say was the reason he did this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| He tried to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I was in the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| And then he said he checked the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| And first of all, he was not supposed to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| He said he checked the ID, but he made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| At the time that we wrote this citation, he told me that he was in the he was back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| and I could hear the dishes running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=542)|

| 0:09:06| It was in the back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=546)|

| 0:09:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| Any other commissioners have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| I'm going to make a motion that we suspend his license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Not only do you have one thing, but you've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| I think that we need to send a clear message that we just can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| I mean, this is the first one that we've had in a while, so I'm not sure that I'll get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| But I'm not asking that you be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I'm just saying that we suspend the license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| I'll second that, Commissioner Harriman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| It's very serious, especially since he's had his license for such a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| You'd think you'd be on your best behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And so this is a serious offense and we don't want to see you back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Is the person properly seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=603)|

| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| I'm number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| These are applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| 6A is Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTMs, 7712 Clinton Highway for on-premises, formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:47| He was not sworn earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| He was insecure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Mr. Pitner, I'm going to have you raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| Right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Do you swear from the testimony you've given this matter shall be the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Mr. Pitner, you've been before this board for the last couple of months with regard to your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| The request for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| I believe at last month's meeting they granted you a temporary beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| It was my understanding that U.K. and I believe there was some one of the other departments were going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| check on some things that you had out there at the store and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| I believe one of the commissioners was going to give us a report to the board with regard to that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I've been by Mr. Pitner's place at least three times, and I can report to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| I have not been inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| But I might once I get off this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| He's cleaned that place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| He's painted the outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| He's had some graphic artist go out there and do a real nice sign on the south side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| I understand from U.K. Minot that there were some other modifications made out there that I have not personally seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| He'll probably address that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| But it's the building outside is much more presentable than it was prior to us dealing with Mr. Pitner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:19| over the last six months over his beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| So that's my report to the commission, to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=747)|

| 0:13:18| Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=798)|

| 0:13:20| If you'd like to wait until after the meeting, they'll write your beer permit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=800)|

| 0:17:04| Mr. Rountree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Sir, that restaurant's been in business out there for several years, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Right by Kroger's, is that where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| So you all are just, you bought it from someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Is that what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Actually, we didn't buy it from someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Well, he was, he had, he was a member, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| And then he decided to sell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| And the beer permit was under his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| And that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| I haven't been out there lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I figured it was still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| It's a pretty popular restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Any other discussion from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Do I hear a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1066)|

| 0:17:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Mr. Chairman, is this pending like the server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| It's pending a closeout in business tax and them opening a new business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| And also we need a copy of the certificate of registration, your state sales tax number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Hold on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| My motion is pending no things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| His sales tax and his state registration is like it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| His beer license was the only thing that had to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| He's got a state sales tax and a valid business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| But he was operating on the other fellow's beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| You have that in file over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I looked at it the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| U.K. is the business license in his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| That's how I caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| It just took me a year and a half, but I finally caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| If it's approved, we would have to go back through and check that to make sure that all the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| tax and the business license are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| It is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I checked it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| It might have been, what is today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| It is last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Today is Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| You checked with all the departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| He's got everything in order now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Clerk, if you would, just tell us again what will be, if this is approved, what will be pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| We will check on the other gondolier pizza during the closeout business tax and opening a new business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| And also we need a copy of the certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| So everybody knows what we're voting on to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1188)|

| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Sir, if you can, I need to see you before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1195)|

| 0:20:23| Could you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| George Kitsos, 118 County Road, 196 Athens, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| sale, manufacture, transportation, intoxicating liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Or any crime involving moral turpitude within the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Have you ever sold beer at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Is there an outstanding license at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I don't have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| It was turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| But there's a mistake somewhere because the same partners are still in the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Steve Rizos, which the license was on, if you look on the application, is one of the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| But on the business license, it's only my name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| But in the partnership, it's three of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| If this is approved, you would have to complete a closeout in the business tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| and open a new business license, and they need a certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| They would have to check all your paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| It would be pending that documentation if it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I mean, what's the reason it was pulled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| What is the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| What was the reason the license was pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| The number on the beer license didn't match the state sales tax name or the business tax name in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:58| Wasn't it 06, I guess, when you all first started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| No, it was 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I missed it a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yes, it was 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| And I had to go back through to see whose name was on the original beer license in 05, and it didn't match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:19| I pulled the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| That's the reason it was pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| But, I mean, the partners are still in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| It's the same people that are still on the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| You're going to have to work with the clerks then and check all the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| and make sure that everything matches the way it's supposed to with regard to the partners in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| as well as the tax numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| So, I mean, what do I need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| You'll have to get with the clerks afterwards, and they'll help you sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| I mean, sort the papers, but, I mean, the beer permit, what's the deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| It's the same partners in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Well, the beer inspector has pulled your license because they're saying that your paperwork is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| And we'll go over and go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| They'll work with you to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| UK, you're going to have to either speak in the microphone or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| I told them we'd go over and go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| The only other thing, they don't either one of them need to pay the probate tax because they've been sending it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| For the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I mean, we haven't been in any violation that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Sir, that's how I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| No, no, I mean, I understand your point, but we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Now, when I went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| When I went in down there, you didn't have nobody certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And that's what I went through the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I mean, we'll be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I'm sure you're going to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| We'll help you with the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| The clerk's office will work with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| But at this point, since it's been pulled, they're going to have to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Let me finish asking these questions and then you can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| It's my understanding that this is an on-premise request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1455)|

| 0:30:37| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Any other business come for the beer board today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Mr. Chairman, I need to run it by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| You can do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| On this pending codes, why go build a new store on Middlebrook Pike right across the street from the school down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1853)|
| 0:31:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| They had come to the beer board six years ago, and it was approved pending codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| Are there anything we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| The way buildings is going up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| We.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| I told the people when I got a call, there wasn't nothing that the beer board can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Could we not, when it's pending, bring them back the next month instead of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| And I believe the clerk's office got another call about they wanted to build a store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| but it would be about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| At least a lot can happen in two years now, the way they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| It's something you all need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| I don't know how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Is that in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I would think that would be the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Chairman, is there a way that we could put a time limit on that pending motion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| after six months or a year, just like Mr. Minot said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| you need to have some sort of time constraints not to just let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| We'll have to change our bylaws, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| But like Mr. Minot said, obviously, you have construction that goes on around places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| and so you want to make sure that we are maintaining the current laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| I think codes has got, if it's not six months, I believe, is like on a new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| if it sits empty for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Is that right, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| The only thing that the code of Knox County says is that they have to begin construction within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| Once they've begun construction, it can take however long it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Grant, could you look at this and bring us a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| I'll talk to Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Because if you could maybe do that in 30 days or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| but if you could look at it and bring us a recommendation as to what you feel needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| I mean, that is the adopted code of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| So if something were going to change, that would have to be amended by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| That's why I was asking him to look at it and bring it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| and we can see what action might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| It would need to come from the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| So, you know, from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Anything else come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Before we adjourn, I want to thank all the commissioners that are rotating off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you for your time and service and doing your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| I think you all have done a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| So, and you may open your own beer store someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2036)|

| 0:36:24| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| We know it is the nature of creator to love creation just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| mothers and fathers love their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| But our community has been shaken by violence in holy places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| where people worship and in trusted places where children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2202)|

| 0:36:48| another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2208)|

| 0:37:14| in service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Help us keep our criticism tempered with understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| Help us keep our rhetoric checked by compassion for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| with whom we do not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| For in the dark night when our brains are tired of working and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| our bodies hurt from tension, in those times when we are closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2252)|

| 0:37:44| In spite of all that would divide us, all that would hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| us, we share a deep and sacred humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2268)|

| 0:42:04| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I'd like for us to consider adding or placing the charter amendments item back on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:21| for consideration today for the reason that it's become a virtual certainty that the petitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| will be successful and an absolute certainty that the bill that the county will have to pay for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| petition will be $80,000 to verify signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| At present, there's 36,000 to 37,000 signatures that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| The petitioners have 40,000 signatures, and they've statistically determined the number that it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| for them to reach this 36,000 point, 37,000 point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| They're going to exceed this by possibly 5,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| They are going to be successful without a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| And so regardless of what we feel about individual petitioned items, I think it would be wise for us to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:20| back up and reconsider our position before where we denied the petitioner's request to place on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| So I'd like to place this on our agenda today, and I think this may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| and the law director will have to confirm this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| I think this might require suspension of the rules due to it being inside 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| John, do you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| You would need a two-thirds vote to get it added to the agenda in any event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| So if it has been within 90, within 60 days, actually, if it has been within 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| you would need to have a suspension of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| But this may be well outside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| But you need a two-thirds vote to add that matter to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| I will second Commissioner Norman's motion to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| I guess we probably need to go ahead and take this up individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2667)|

| 0:44:32| I believe the noes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Sounded like they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| How many noes were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I'm sorry, what was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| So what are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| We're voting on to add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| We need a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| How about a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Yeah, we're going to have to have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2688)|

| 0:45:17| I'll put it on the agenda, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2719)|

| 0:45:59| Item number 119, honoring John Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| He contacted me and asked if we could defer this 30 days because he could not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| So if we could defer 119.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| And then when we get to it, if we could pull out from 104 through 118 and then 121 through 124,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| if we could just sort of have all those names read all at one time so we could honor all those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| for their service to Knox County and just have them all come up at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| and then we can give them our appreciation at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| 119, John just asked for that to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| Well, he asked me to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Well, I talked to him yesterday and he said that he'd rather just have it removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| He didn't want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| If he wants it removed, we'll just remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| We'll just withdraw it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| But I talked to him last week and that's what he asked for, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| I would ask that items 804 and 906 be removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I have a couple of questions, brief questions about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| 804 and 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| I just wanted to make sure that the resolution, I believe it's 920, that the law department had prepared for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:39| and Commissioner DeFreeze with regard to accepting a donation from a citizen with regard to the green waste testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:48| Would that be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Ken, if there's objection, it's now the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I'm going to object to the 920 being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:16| Are there any other objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Commissioner Davis, do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| I'm going to object also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Commissioner Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I would like to move the talking about the discussion of the hospitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| account to the front, act as consent, and I would like to have Mr. Bosch to come down and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| You know, I was on the forum against hiring a lawyer and he called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| and I thought, well, we need to give him the opportunity to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| What number is that, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| I don't believe there's a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| It's just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| It's on discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Are there any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| I'll be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| One objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Can I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Paul, if you don't mind, I have an honorary thing I'd like to have proceed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| The honorary is going to come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| The honorary will come before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2990)|

| 0:49:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| I have a resolution 921 to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=2995)|
| 0:50:09| I'm sorry, Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| If we could, could we please add 921?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3015)|

| 0:50:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| I'd like to pull off of consent 120, and if we can move that up closest to the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| after whatever's been put on there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Also, resolution 907 dealing with tax management about some pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| We have a representative from tax management here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| He'd like to try to get it done as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| He's got a long drive back to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| So if we could move him up as close as we can to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| There's no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| We'll move it up after Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I think one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Can we do withdrawals now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Are we doing withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| I want withdrawal 917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| And also resolution here, 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| If we could put that, when we do that, the school superintendent will be here around 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| He's on an extremely tight schedule with what has happened at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| So if we can do that around 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| If we see him in the audience, we can go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| We'll move it up after Commissioner Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3089)|

| 0:51:41| I would like to see items 101 and 102, the honorariums involving the Unitarian churches, be taken off consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| and heard during the honorarium section with a presentation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3109)|

| 0:52:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I said 405, 808, 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| I need to abstain on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| And then 915 and 919, which I don't believe are on consent, but I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| And I think that's my entire list, and I thank you for your patience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| To the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3180)|

| 0:53:02| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Has 910 been pulled from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3184)|

| 0:53:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure we add everything that says to be added and withdraw all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| that say to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Defer everything that needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Defer everything that says to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Commissioner DeFries, do you have another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Number 914, if we could move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| I know that several people have been moving things up earlier in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| If we could move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| We'll move it up after Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| So where will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Oh, after the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| There's some things you're going to have to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| You know, you're going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| We have one Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| There's people here to speak on 915 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I don't know where you put that in the packet order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| You want it moved up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| We can move it up after Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| I think it's got to be at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| Commissioner Smith, what was it, 914?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| 125, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Which one did you want moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| No, who want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Oh, Commissioner Ballard, which one would you want moved up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| 915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| If you guys don't do your thing, if you don't do it, then all this stuff is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Doug Patel has an item to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| I think Commissioner Lutho covered it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| and adding all those to be added is on the list at 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Did you have another one, Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| The item that both Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and I are co-sponsoring and requesting, item 920,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| gentleman Chuck Jensen, if we could have that about 4.30 or 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| that would be really convenient, or maybe right after zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| I hope we'd be out of here before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| So 4.30, can we somewhere ballpark it between 4.30 and 5.30 somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| When he gets here, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| As it relates to that, I guess I'm putting the cart before the horse on that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| Don't we need a two-thirds vote to add that to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| If there's any objection to any of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| then there ought to be a vote on it and there ought to be a two-thirds vote in order to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| So Mr. Jensen may, I mean, if it's not added, he may not need to come unless he wants to talk at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So there was some objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| Well, there may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:43| Mr. McKenzie, you have an objection to 9.20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I think it's 1.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| To 1.20, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3411)|

| 0:56:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| I would like to see item 9.20 added to the agenda, and I suggest we probably need a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| That's what I'm asking if there's some objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| We need to take a vote, two-thirds vote to get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| I'm starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| This is 9.20 to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3433)|

| 0:58:19| The pass does not wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| It fails 11-7 in one pass, so it will not be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| We also need to vote on the hospitality count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3512)|

| 0:58:49| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| The hospitality audit doesn't have a resolution number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| and it was on our agendas for both intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| So I thought it was part of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| So the only thing we could do, if it's, I don't believe it's an item to be added, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| No, it's just I asked for it to be moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3551)|

| 0:59:29| Oh, it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| You're coming at me so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| As a discussion item, there's nothing to vote on, it's just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| We got it covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| The only thing I asked for was for it to be moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I don't have an objection to moving it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:47| Was there an objection to 921?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| Okay, we'll be adding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| I'll object to it, 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Does everyone have 921?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:20| I need to take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| What about some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Before I vote on it, I'd like to hear what Mr. Bosch has to say at whatever time we're going to give him an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| opportunity to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| I think it needs to come now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Well, would he not be speaking when we have our discussion about the hospitality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| Yeah, but they're wanting to fire him right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| So before we fire somebody, I'd like to hear why we ought to keep him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| What about just about Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| I posted on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| This is just to add it or not add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Oh, it's just to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Yes, just to add or not add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Chairman, if it is added, can we move it to be close to when Mr. Bosch speaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| I think it would be appropriate to move it to right after we have our discussion about the hospitality fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Well, I'll tell you something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| We have three people trying to keep up with this and we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| Did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| We'll move it right after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| We'll move it right after the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| But we still need a vote to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=3708)|

| 1:15:07| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4507)|

| 1:15:19| On Thursday, we did have a very tragic incident at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| And we mourn the loss of young life that was taken there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| But as Commissioner Smith has noted, the response to that incident, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| from all perspectives, was truly outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| When you look at the work that our administration at Central Office, under the leadership of John Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| the teachers, the staff, and others at Central High School, and their quick response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| in order to make sure that students were safe, their execution of our safety plan at Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| and a situation where they literally had to pull kids into their classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| in order to execute our containment, or what is commonly referred to as lockdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| They pulled kids out of the hallways, made sure they were safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| kept them in their classrooms for about two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| and then the orderly dismissal of students to their parents and to their personal vehicles was truly an outstanding response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| I want to thank our Central High School staff and the Central Office staff who responded to the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| I want to thank, in particular, the Knox County Sheriff's Office, Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| and all other first responders who were there to assist with both the law enforcement aspect of this incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| and also the response to the incident in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I also want to thank the students, the parents, and so many others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| who are part of the Central High School community, such as Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| who really have, in the immediate aftermath and in the days since, have really come together as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| and this incident will raise a lot of questions, it will raise a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| and a lot of concerns that we intend to work together to talk about as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| to think about as a community, to develop additional strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| to look at all of our policies and protocols and safety plans and the like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| to make sure that we're doing everything that we possibly can to ensure the safety of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| I want to thank all of those who were involved in the response to this incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| because it truly was outstanding, and I appreciate all that our law enforcement and first responders did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| all that the teachers and staff at Central High School did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| and the strength and patience of parents and students as they worked through some of these issues together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| I was at Central High School just a little while ago this afternoon, we had about 90% attendance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| What's most remarkable to me is on Friday, we made the decision to have school on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| and to basically offer some structure to students who wish to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| to have some routine, to have some structure in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| to have an opportunity for them to come together as a community with their teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| with the other adults who care about them in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| to have some additional resources and counseling available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| And on Friday, every single teacher, every single staff member was in attendance on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| which to me is just absolutely remarkable, that in the aftermath of such a tragic incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| that was certainly traumatic for the staff and the teachers as well as the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| they were there for their kids as they were on Thursday and will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So I thank them for that and I thank all of you for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| and the recognition of the staff at Central High School and the other first responders for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4729)|

| 1:20:56| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| I want to thank Commissioner Davis for the resolution that she wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:15| Each of us took a slightly different path to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I wrote a resolution about our joy at how our community responded and the great outpouring of love that was so important in countering the hate that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:31| And Commissioner Davis properly recognized the individuals who subdued the gunmen and saved many more lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| I think both resolutions are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| I'm glad that we have passed them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| And I'm so glad that both of our Unitarian ministers are here to accept these resolutions on behalf of the persons being honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| Elaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Pastor, if you'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I had bought some Bibles and asked that each of the Commission members sign these in dedication to those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4911)|
| 1:22:07| And the reason why I chose this is because Luke 4, there's a story in there that's one of my favorite lessons of the Bible where Jesus said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:17| I've been tempted by Satan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| And he has the power and the authority to rebuke Satan, but in Luke he uses the scripture to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:30| And the lesson of that is for us that there's power in these words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| And so I graciously offer the power and the strength and the comfort of these words to those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I will hand one of these individually to incoming Commissioner Amy Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:48| Her husband was one of those who tackled the gunmen, and I will give that to her on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| And the rest to Reverend Bice, because those members of his congregation saved many lives, probably including my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=4973)|

| 1:23:45| And I'll be glad to hand them their resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| However you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5029)|

| 1:27:10| I just want to echo what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5230)|

| 1:27:47| I'm not even sure how to put it in words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| what Knox County has been through for the last, say, year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| has been remarkable, to say the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| and we've had a lot of good people serve within Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| and I just think we should take the time to honor them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| and we traditionally do that here in the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| and I just wanted to show my appreciation to all those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| that did step up and serve Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| and I think they all did it in a very honorable way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| and I just wanted to show my appreciation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5304)|

| 1:28:35| I think it stands to show that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| and everybody else here appreciates what you all do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5319)|

| 1:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| If you can mess with it there for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| we can go ahead and see if it will come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Emily was a student at Hollis Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I mean, Adrian Burnett, my daughter Brooke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| just started Hollis Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Principal Kathy Dugan was going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| and I don't know if she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| But she certainly, Emily was a special girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| She was chosen by the Children's Miracle Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| as a 2008 champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Being, though, being as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| that I can't talk to you all individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| I could have got on public forum over the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| but I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I would like to ask each commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| to donate $100 out of your discretionary fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| along with me, in honor of Emily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| She started a --her family has started a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:11| an organization, a nonprofit organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| to help children that come down with cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| It affects 17 million children a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| in the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| So it doesn't just go to our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| but it goes to a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| and I think we ought to do all that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| to help our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| But I want to introduce Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| That's Emily's father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| He can tell you a little bit about Emily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| and about the Butterfly Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| January 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| my daughter was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| 250 kids a year in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| get diagnosed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| She is one of the 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| She passed away two months ago yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Emily wasn't the only Knox County kid, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| who was diagnosed with this very rare form of cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| There was another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| and she passed away about three weeks after Emily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| And so my wife and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| and Maddie Harrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| who's the little girl who passed away after Emily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| have gotten together to create a fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| to help in the fight against childhood cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| and specifically rhabdomyosarcoma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| which is, as you all have heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| it's one of the most deadly forms of cancer for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| and also one of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| It's very, I guess, underfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| So we're stepping up our effort to continue the fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| and also to help out the wonderful people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| at Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| who helped us during our month and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| in intensive care with Emily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| Brian, the mayor just handed me this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| and the mayor's staff has just proclaimed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| August 25th, Emily Barger Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| So we want to present this to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| And I don't mean to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| but I didn't see any one of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| that didn't want to give or couldn't give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| so hopefully we can send this on in Emily's memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| And I prayed, and I know you all have, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| for Brian and Misty and the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| And we need to keep them in our prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| But Emily was a special girl in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:44| And I think it'd be appropriate at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| maybe, if we all stand and have a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5686)|
| 1:35:03| Amen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5736)|
| 1:36:01| Have we already done 301?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| We haven't, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5766)|

| 1:36:40| that were supposed to have been moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Mr. Chairman, I think I'd ask for TMA to be moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| Wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Mr. Chairman, did we just do 301?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| That was pulled from consent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| I believe Commissioner Campbell wanted to speak on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| and you just caught him off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Yeah, sorry about that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| I don't know if any other commissioners were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| point of order since we just voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I think you would probably need to make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| You just wanted to make some comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Well, there was someone here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| I did, but it was actually pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5843)|

| 1:37:25| Vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Yeah, we had to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| I'll second the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| I'll make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5851)|

| 1:37:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5856)|

| 1:37:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| No, I don't know if any other commissioners were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| in contact about this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| but somebody was here and contacted me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| speaking on that behalf, and I just wanted to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Ann Marie Leahy to come up and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| I don't need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| My name is Ann Marie Leahy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| I'm with Public Communications Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| I reside at 3828 Center Plaza Drive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Houston, Texas, 77007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| My company and I bid on the Inmate Telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Services Project, and my first point would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| that the procurement office represented by Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Myers did an absolutely outstanding job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| in a very difficult RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| PCS has been working to gain this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| with Knox County for the past six to seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| and in gathering the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| we encountered several obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| We believed that those obstacles had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| overcome and that the platform would be fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| to all vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Upon the intent of award notification that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| sent to us within the last several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| we learned that the award was going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| incumbent vendor, which is Paytel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| Two of the reasons that were cited raised a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| few question marks, if not eyebrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| One brought to attention that there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| references that were judged by some members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| of the evaluation committee to be fair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| decent, and others to be horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| We also had an erroneous error with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| Better Business Bureau rating, which has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| since been corrected, and I've brought copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| for those who are interested in seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| The other item that raised our eyebrows is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| that the evaluation document on page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| which I did send out to all commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| indicated that a change in vendor would result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| in a loss of the integrity of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| If that were true, and it was a key point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| of evaluation, no other vendor other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| the incumbent would have had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| to bid on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| That being said, my company, having had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| relationship with the incumbent Paytel in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| past, having used the exact same boxes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Paytel is using in your jail today, PCS was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| fully prepared to transfer the data so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| the ten-year-old call records would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| be available for investigator use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| However, we can also maintain it in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| current form because we are familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| and own the exact same hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| So we were questioning whether or not it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| an absolutely fair evaluation, knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| someone who had worked with the Paytel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| incumbent provider and individual supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| the contract for the last, I think, ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| of that contract may have been open-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| in considering a new opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| The upside is that either way, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| is getting increased revenues from its phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| system than it's had in the past ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| PCS pushed hard to make sure the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| understood that you were getting far less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| than industry standard in that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| So you will see increases over the six to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| nine thousand in the past with the incumbent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| vendor who was selected again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| PCS, for example, offered 21,500 or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| 42% commission, whichever was greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| So either way you slice it, you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| more money, whether it's with Paytel or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| whether it's with PCS or another provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| But we do have some questions over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| evaluation committee members' ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| be unbiased during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Yes, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| Seeing none, I need the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| Is Matt Myers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| Sorry, Matt, you're back in the shadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| I couldn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Matt, could you address the lady's concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| Well, you know, Ann Marie brings up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| good consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| I will tell you that in the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| documents, I don't know that those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| were directed right at Paytel, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| PCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| The evaluation criteria that was used was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| the rates and commission, the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| equipment and services, and industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| That's how the proposals were scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| And yes, I will say that the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| more than doubled the revenue from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| past contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| With Paytel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| So what would that amount be today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| It's in the $204,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| If you took the 2007 numbers that I gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| all of the proposers to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| it's $204,000, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| And that will change as months go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| You finish commissioning that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Sheriff, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| Oh, there's Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| Did you hear what he said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I think he said the process is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| through the purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| It's not through the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| I think they just asked for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| bid out and whatever it is, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Just a quick question here, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| Specifically, the point raised about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| loss of data, was that considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| in the evaluation process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Did that play a role in any of the categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| It may have been considered, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| as other information that we may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| to look at when we're evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| But from what I've heard, that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| sort of a bogus point under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| Well, I wouldn't consider the loss of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| a bogus point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Well, only if it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| If it doesn't occur, then it's a bogus point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| I scored mine based on the criteria that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| The issue was raised in our conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| with the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Well, thank you for the sort of answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| To be fair to Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| two of the evaluators are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| the sheriff's office, not from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| And the loss of data refers to a loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| of what some are calling the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| of that data to be able to be passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| through a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| Call recordings from the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| as we all have seen in Orlando, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| are often used on ongoing cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| and media and all kinds of other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| But those recordings moving from a radical box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| to what would have been a PCS AGM box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| or any other vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| even if Paytel moves them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| onto a new piece of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| the concern is not over the loss of the data itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| but rather over the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| of that data being maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| as it's moved from one box to another box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Think of it as an eight-track tape conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| to an iPod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| So the concern was, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| the legal admissibility of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Of 10-year-old data, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Matt, who was on that evaluation committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Evaluation was consistent of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Buddy Burkhardt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| and I believe it was Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I want to say Brian Bivins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| I believe it was Brian Bivins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| were Knox County procurement codes followed on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yes, sir, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| I paid close attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| to this particular solicitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| and as the representative from PCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| it was a very good process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| and it came out with a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| a very good contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| for the county moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| Still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| I just want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| if either one of these are local companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Local companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Neither company has a Knoxville address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Does either company have anybody here to service these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| give a service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| I'm not sure where the paytel service rep resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:20| We have a service rep here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| for paytel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Paytel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Well, where would the rep come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| PCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| They're going to be moving here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:43| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Matt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| I just wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| was PCS allowed to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| their Better Business Bureau rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| and address some of the other concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| prior to your decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| The Better Business Bureau rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| was not taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:06| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| She says they're on two of the evaluation forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| from Mr. Bivens and Mr. Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| In answer to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| no, that was not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| So they weren't afforded the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| to make sure that all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| presented to you was accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| The Better Business Bureau information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| was never asked from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| It was other information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| that was discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| Can you just explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| the reason why you chose paytel over PCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| Paytel over PCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| we've more than doubled their technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| I actually had it scored a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| If you go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| and look at the evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| I had either a .6 or a .4 difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| actually going to PCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| But the evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| the way it's set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| everybody scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| we accumulate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| and the top proposer wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| Paytel brings a good working knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| They have a local service rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| They gave us 42.75%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| of the billable revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| and commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| They just went out on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Both companies are good companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I wouldn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I think both companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| could do the project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Ms. Leahy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| there was some correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| that we have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| that you felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| there was something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| You smelled something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| You felt like there was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| And you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| there was something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| You smelled something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| You felt like there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| something that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| checked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| Are you referring to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| more than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| you've already mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| that the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| of the Evaluation Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| who are representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| and have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| with the incumbent vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| may be predisposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| And when you read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| through the evaluation forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| it scores heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| about our Better Business Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| rating being an F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| which we've corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| And it scored us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| against not including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| word recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| which we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| is highly cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| anybody can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| It's how much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| are you going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| It's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| There's just no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| it can be free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| So the two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| that we were hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| really heavily on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| what we expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| to be in form of references,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| which we provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| within the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| And word recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| was a value add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| that we simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| it's in the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| to spend $100,000 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Well, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| the first that I've known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| and it's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| difficult to digest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| here on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| as we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| at a lot of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6608)|

| 1:50:10| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| it's my last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I'm not going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| I would like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| some motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| for other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| to have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| to look into this further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| if they feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| There will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Do we have a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6629)|

| 1:50:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6631)|

| 1:50:33| Who's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| to make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Who all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6637)|

| 1:50:44| I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| on several occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| to all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| that are seated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| I've dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6650)|

| 1:50:52| I've sent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| by email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| were probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6658)|

| 1:51:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| I'm just thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| if you're complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| about two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| that served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| these are the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| who know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| about the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| if you're saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| but to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| out of the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| who knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| nothing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| to try to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| for the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| it wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| to go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| trying to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Let me be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| direct then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I am not complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| on the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| They are both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| fine gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| I'm sure they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| an exemplary track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| or they wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| in the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| We had a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| getting accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| financial information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| paramount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| to building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| a financial offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| During the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| of the RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| three different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| versions of call data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| And Mr. Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| worked diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| but each time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| we got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| it was slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Sometimes it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| a 6,000 commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Sometimes it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| a 9,000 commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| It was 25,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| It was 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| It made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| a financial model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| That information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| readily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| to each and every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6752)|

| 1:52:36| PCS even provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| to the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6757)|

| 1:52:39| sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| a copy of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| should look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| that familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| with the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6765)|

| 1:52:47| a copy from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| one of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| It was very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| That's unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| in the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=6771)|

| 2:02:14| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Just a point of interest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Can I change my vote to no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| Four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| We're on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| We're going to review the hospitality audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| I think we're in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| Very confusing up here in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| Everybody's shouting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Page 28, review of the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Let me flip over that page, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7371)|

| 2:03:14| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| Commissioner DeFries, did you want to hear from Mr. Bosch now or did you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| I asked to hear him first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Well, Mr. Pinkston, follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| It was me instead of Mr. DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Mr. Bosch, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| You guys look so much alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| You have the same voice, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| I will not confuse the two this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| We don't look alike, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| For the record, please, Don Bosch, 712 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| A number of you I've had an opportunity to speak with about the role that we were asked to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| approximately a month ago as special counsel to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| And I think our mandate that was given to us was to advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| and assist as it relates to the hospitality audit and the grants fund audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| which is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| When that assignment was made, clearly decisions had not been made by what initially was Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| Nichols' office and then Bill Bright and now by State Attorney General Bob Cooper as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:25| or not they would investigate and possibly pursue any and all courses of action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| if any existed, against the current mayoral administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| Since your request to appoint us, that obviously has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| and I don't think that is news to anybody on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| I will tell you, for those that I've had an opportunity to speak with prior to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| before that event happened, that is General Cooper's announcement that he was going to undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| this investigation, assist as ouster counsel, and evaluate this from a universal perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7495)|
| 2:05:03| that is all courses of civil and potentially criminal action by way of taking Bill Bright into his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:12| In other words, consuming him into the State Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| from the Shelby County District Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| I think that the role that was envisioned or expected, if I can be bold enough to suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| that I understand what 19 thought processes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| where what possibilities exist for this body to take any appropriate actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| and investigatory review of the mayor's office and these audits and accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:40| We have heard expressed some concern about a meeting several meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| about how the meeting was conducted and whether or not it was effective and thorough and fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| and I think that there was a desire that should such a meeting, be it specially called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| or there are a variety of meetings that this body could call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| that it be conducted in some manner differently than the initial request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| to have the mayor and his staff come down here and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| I will tell you, as I have told the individuals who have come and met with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| that in light of General Cooper's announcement that they are investigating this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| as your counsel, I would strongly discourage, at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| taking any action as it relates to a specially called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| That said, my role as lawyer is unique in that it is your decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| A lot of people have come to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| are you the prosecutor now, are you these things, and clearly that's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| I've described our role, subject to your approval, as we're merely a flashlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| and it is for you to tell us what you want to look at and what you wish to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| And we have, to the extent that it's been possible for each of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| that have been able to meet with us, and we are attempting to meet with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| outgoing and incoming, and I've had phone calls and personal meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7616)|
| 2:07:01| We're listening to everybody's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| And again, as I said, I think with General Cooper's announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| our role likely has changed for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| I would suggest that our role should change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| and that is in the mandate to advise and assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| we have been in regular contact with General Cooper's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| and particularly Mike Myers, who's head of the division that prosecutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| and looks at these kinds of matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| and have received a lot of good and valuable information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| and some of which I think can be appropriate to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| subject to your questions at this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Others, although it could be discussed, I would urge you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| as I did in my first correspondence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| to remember that there is an attorney-client privilege in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| However, it is for the commission to waive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| I can assure you that we will keep those confidences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| but it is for each of you to decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| or not you choose to waive any attorney-client privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| and any information that we communicate as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| to waive it and announce it publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| That's a decision for you, not for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| That said, I take no offense at the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| do we need Don Bosch and his law firm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| I take no offense at the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| should we discharge him to save the county money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| I will tell you that I think that there is a valuable role that we can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| I think for those that have had an opportunity to speak with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| and Ann Short-Bowers, a lawyer in my office that's also been appointed to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| each time somebody comes in, there's been a new series of questions posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| based on the what-ifs of this situation that we've done our best to try to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| Clearly, with the change in administration in the county law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| there are sort of new paradigms and new questions that may be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| And we, as your independent counsel in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| we have one master to serve, and that is this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| And we will serve it at your discretion and your pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| and stand ready to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| And I stand ready here today to answer any particular questions that any of you individual commissioners may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:16| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| Hi, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| This body asked me a month or so ago to hire counsel to advise and assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:30| and I did so, and I did so by resolution of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| which also alluded to a conflict of interest that me and my office may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:43| In light of that, that basically prevents me from advising anyone about these two audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:53| And so if you were to pass your resolution, which basically discharges Mr. Bosch and his firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7793)|
| 2:10:06| then you will have no one to advise you on any questions that you have, at least for the next six days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| I'm not sure what the new law director would have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| I have not talked with Mr. Lockett about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| But with that said, I would encourage you to not to pass the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| to keep your line of communication open with counsel that I have talked with, with Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:38| I've shared information with Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| And I've done the same with Bud Gilbert, who is representing the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| So each of you have attorneys to advise and assist you related to these two audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:56| And that's how it stands, and I would encourage you to leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| And, you know, maybe in six or seven days things will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| All I can tell you is I can't advise and assist you by virtue of the resolution that was passed by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| nor can I advise and assist the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:20| And Don, I mean, you know, Don and Bud, both, and Ann Short, Ann Short-Bowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:31| they are seasoned attorneys who, you know, are available to help and they've agreed to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:38| Sometimes it's hard to find folks to jump in the middle of a matter and assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| and Don was not the first person that I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| So I appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| I don't really think we need to act on this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| I think there are other agencies that are looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| So I don't think we need to act on this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| but I think that we do need to retain counsel just in case we do have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| So I'm going to make the motion that we defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| and I would also like for Mr. Bosch to tell his hourly rate so that commissioners can keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| when they are calling and asking questions so that they do realize that taxpayer money is being expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| And, you know, not that someone should refrain from seeking counsel from their counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| but if, you know, based on the rate, I think that we should be very frugal in how often we seek that counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:46| But my motion is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| Commissioner Lambert, to answer your question, I would have loved to have been able to set my usual rate on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| but I was informed by Mr. Owings that the county contract rate is $225 an hour, and that's what we're billing at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| We have not submitted our bill yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| I will tell you that, frankly, given the change very shortly after we were appointed to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| the change being that Bob Cooper's office is doing things that, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:16| we or any other counsel on this body couldn't do by way of the fact that they are the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| and they have a unique toolbox full of subpoenas and other mechanisms that we may not be able to utilize, governmental subpoenas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| that the hours, the time that we're expending is going to be, at least for the moment, far less than we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| But our rate is $225 an hour, and that is what's prescribed in the county budget for outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| Which is a bargain for an attorney of your stature, I'll have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| I appreciate that vote, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we drop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| This is how I don't think we need to be discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| This is in the state attorney general's hands and the district attorney down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| No matter what we do, we cannot prosecute if they're found guilty or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:11| I think we need to leave it up to them to do their job now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| That's where I've been trying to get it for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| I think we could possibly say something that might hinder their investigation, which we shouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| And at this time, I'm going to do like I said on the 15th when I posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| I don't think that we should hire either attorney with this in the state attorney general's hands and Bill Bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:42| We need to save the taxpayers all the money that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| And all we could do by talking and discussing this is probably hinder the case in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| So I'm going to make a motion that we drop the discussion and go about our own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8091)|
| 2:15:00| Do we have a second to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| There will be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Is there any discussion to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Obviously this has been a fluid situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| And so over the past 30 days, we've had a lot of things occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| And I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Pinkston that we don't want to do anything that jeopardizes their investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| or taints any evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| And so I'm in complete agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| But also I do believe that we do need to retain counsel just as Law Director Owings had so eloquently stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| We won't have counsel at all for at least a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| We may want to keep him around for just a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8145)|
