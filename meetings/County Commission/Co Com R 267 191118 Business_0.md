| 0:01:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Before we jump into tonight's agenda, I realize we may have some folks who are joining us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| at their first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| We also have some folks who may be tuning into this meeting, watching it on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Always like to kind of lay out the expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| The county commission met in work session last week and did our first work through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| And many of the items that we're going to be voting on tonight were discussed and debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| and were actually moved onto tonight's consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| So that puts us in a position where we have just a couple of items that we will be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| over to have an actual formal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| However, at one point, I'm going to ask the clerk to read all of the items that are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| our consent agenda into the record so that the commission can vote on all those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| that have already been effectively deemed non-controversial or fully debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So we can vote on all those items with one vote rather than taking 50 different individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| So with that said, we'll now move up and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| I'm also going to make an adjustment to our normal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| After the devotional and the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag, we're going to move immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| into the honorary resolution portion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| We've got one honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| After that, we will go to public forum and then formally setting tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| So with that said, I'll now call on Commissioner Daley for tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=150)|

| 0:12:34| One is to come back and see my former colleagues and the present members of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| Some of the best time I've ever spent in public service is sitting right where you are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| But it's especially an honor to be here tonight so we can honor this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| which has been recognized nationally for what they've done for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| I'm not going to repeat much of what was already said, but I will read this Tennessee Senate proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| It says, whereas we are pleased to recognize those exemplary businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=781)|

| 0:13:17| of the 111th General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at the request of and in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=797)|

| 0:13:30| upon its receipt of the 2019 Dream Big Small Business of the Year Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=810)|

| 0:13:50| Mr. Chairman, or now Madam Chairman, if we could for just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| maybe we could have Dan Hurst come up and introduce some members of his team, if that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| That would be quite all right. I just came down in order to invite him to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| So, the whole team, if they could all come up please, that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And I just want to congratulate the team. As I told them earlier, to get an award like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| it took many, many years of the team working together to achieve greatness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| And we're just proud of them and proud that they're a part of our Knox County community and making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| I'll add one thing. He's going to introduce some of the professional members of his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| but sitting immediately to his right may be the most important member of his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| that I think even he would agree that none of this would happen without her support too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you so much. Thank you so, so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=891)|
| 0:15:06| Just a few of our team could be here today, and I'm proud to have them around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| And you made me cry. I was born on Ball Road, and I wish my parents were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=915)|
| 0:15:35| They love Knox County, and I'm just so honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| But what I want to say is our team is grateful and blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| I did want you to meet my wife, Patty, and she's been as important to this journey as I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| I want to tell you that 39 years ago, this week, we met on the hill over at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| And so I was an eighth generation East Tennessean, and she was an eighth generation West Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| And we've been together ever since, 39 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| Into and through the Navy, and back to Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| and then through sorting out what to do with our lives and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Twenty years ago, I called her at work one day, and I said, hear me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| I said, our daughter was five at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I said, what if we bought a repo RV and drive around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| We were at this point in life where a lot of us get where you're kind of soul searching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| and discerning what you're being called to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| And I said, let's see the country and pray through where we believe God wants us to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| and what he wants us to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| And so we spent 35 states, 22,000 miles, four provinces in Canada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| pulling a white Jeep and a pink Barbie bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| and praying through and really hoping God would call me to something really novel, miraculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| And what I kept getting over and over through prayer throughout the country was to come back home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| and start a business that will treat people the way you want to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| And that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| And so I'm so thankful for these outcomes like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| and mostly for the team that I've gotten to enjoy the journey with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| I want to say two things about Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| First of all, the volunteer state, the very name of our state, inspires us to service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| service to country, service to customers, service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| And the second is Tennessee is known for stewardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| and I want to celebrate you all as leaders and tell you I truly appreciate your commitment to stewardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| and that includes fiscal stewardship so businesses can start and run and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| It includes social stewardship so our kids can have good schools to attend and care for people in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| And it includes environmental stewardship so tomorrow can be as good for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| and grandchildren as it's been for us with these great natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| The last thing I want to do is in recognizing my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| My partners are here, Elliott Barnett and John Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Darrell Daugherty just had his seventh grandchild today and yesterday and couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| I want to say thanks, team, for embracing our vision of one day becoming a significant company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| if we would hire and care for great people and treat our customers with respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| and earn their respect and serve our community well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| and for living out our core values of integrity, service, and quality every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| and for holding to the ideal of treating others the way you want to be treated because it all comes back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Finally, I'd just say God has blessed our state, our community, our business so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| and I pray that we never lose sight that it's through his providence alone that we live and move and have our being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| So thank you again so much. God bless you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1145)|
| 0:19:15| I might suggest it would be nice if we could get a picture of all y'all up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and if any of the other commissioners would like to join in, that would be nice if you'd like to come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| We want to take pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1163)|
| 0:19:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1172)|
| 0:20:01| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1201)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1230)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Moving back into it, and once again, congratulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| and thank you for all of the important work and the jobs that you're making here for our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| And that's some good PR for Knox County when you get that big national award up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I saw it on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| It was really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Moving forward, the next thing on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I have three folks that have signed up to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| two of which, Mr. Hill and Marshall Smith, when they signed up, they said it was going to be about a zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| so I suspect that they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| and we will probably carry those over to the zoning meeting that starts at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| The third person who signed up for public forum is Katie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| So, if Katie Smith is here, if you could please approach the forum, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1300)|

| 0:21:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| First of all, thank you so much for this opportunity to come and speak to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| and I also want to give a sincere thank you to Commissioner Biggs and to Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| for really jumping into solving an issue that's been long overdue in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| As you probably heard, a week ago today there was a 13-year-old young man who was hit by a car over on Ledgerwood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| and the reason is because mainly there's a lack of crosswalks in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| It's an exit for the school, but yet there are no crosswalks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| And what Commissioner Biggs and Mayor Jacobs has done is they've been able to work with TDOT to come up with a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| and that solution is to add a crosswalk and to add a traffic light for that busy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| One of the main reasons for the increased traffic is due to the parent responsibility zone that's in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| and I understand, rightfully so, that it is a fiscal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Our children matter, though, and the issue that we have in Halls is not just isolated in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| There are lots of schools in Knox County that are on county roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| and this commission, yes, including you, Mr. Bussler, you're in charge of taking care of our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1385)|
| 0:23:15| You're the ones that vote for payments for fixing these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| So I implore you, one, to please vote in favor of the $300,000 to fix the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| but more importantly, I implore you to look in your own districts, to look at the schools in your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| to fix this issue before another child gets hit or killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| Do we really have to wait until a child is hurt or killed before we decide to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| As Reverend Polis said earlier, and I hope you heard him, you are servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| We voted for you to go into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| The last thing I want another parent to have to face is what this couple back here had to face last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| getting a call that their child has been hit because a commissioner wouldn't jump in and take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| wouldn't solve the issue, instead of telling a parent like me that they just need to come up with a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| which is what that man right there told me last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I think you all are better than that, so please, I beg you, please vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| Please don't let another child have to get hurt before you decide to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Okay, next on our agenda is to actually set tonight's agenda, go over a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1483)|
| 0:24:54| We've got a relatively light list of things to vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| I've had two commissioners mention to me things before the meeting that they'd like to add as brief discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| One is a follow-up discussion on charter review from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| So, Madam Clerk, if you could add that, we'll get to that towards the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| We also, Commissioner Bussler, something we saw at the last Tennessee County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| there's a software program for automated roll call votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| and I think Commissioner Bussler had brought up some documentation on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| and I wanted to give him a chance just to kind of share his findings about that with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Third and finally, we do have a reading on the ordinance related to the brew pubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| and we will, before tonight's meeting, we will need to set a public hearing related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| So those are the three things that we're going to be adding tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| And once again, thank you for not bringing any samples to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| And other than that, are there any other items that any commissioners want to pull off of consent as we go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Chairman, may I add just a brief discussion item about the halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Can we move to the top of the agenda while they're still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| While they're here, we can go ahead and move that to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| So we've got charter review, the crossing that Commissioner Biggs just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| and the roll call vote system will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| And then otherwise, we also need to officially add item 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| The non-consent agenda is items 1, 22, 28, 30, 31, and 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1595)|
| 0:26:48| Are there any other changes that commissioners are requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Okay, the chair will entertain a motion to set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Moved by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| And I heard a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Okay, so we have a first by Daley, second by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Now, moving into tonight's agenda, I also want to take just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I see some special folks who have joined us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I'd like to recognize and thank Sheriff Tom Spangler for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| We've got Super Bob Thomas, our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you for being here, Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Also, I saw Nick McBride earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Is Clerk McBride, is he still in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| And Mayor Jacobs, once again, thank you to you and your team for being with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| Have I missed any other elected officials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| All right, thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| There's also, earlier I noticed, and they were sitting in the back because there was one of their classmate's items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| but earlier tonight the group that was sitting behind Mr. Broyles was a group from the Leadership Knoxville Class of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| and we want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Is there any folks who are still from that class here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Our Sheriff's a member of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Oh, and Sheriff, is that your class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Just mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Oh, yeah, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| I think it's the best class ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Yeah, second best class ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| So thank you for getting your classmates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| All right, now moving on, Madam Clerk, that should put us at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| I'd like to go ahead and just knock out some of these discussion items first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| So I'm going to go ahead and move to the discussion item that Commissioner Biggs had brought to us specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| as it relates to public forum earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Members of the Commission, I've placed before you a photo, probably about a thousand-foot picture of Mandeville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| Just to give you guys a little bit of a back story on what this is, at the very beginning of August of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| I had an opportunity to run out and meet the new halls principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Mr. Duff is retired, so I met Spencer Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Whenever I went there, I asked Mr. Long, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| what's some of the things that you're most proud about this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| What's some of the things that you would like to see done better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| And what's an issue that you want to see corrected immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| The number one thing he said was the foot traffic that is leaving the rear entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| He talked about how people are going up beside the Hardee's and jumping over into Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| And if you go out there, it is actually a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| So I actually got the opportunity to ask Senior Director Stoden to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| I asked Patty Bounds and also asked Russ Oaks to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| And we went ahead and decided to put up some crosswalk signs, literally went up two days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| We started working on a plan that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| I think the date was August the 17th was the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| I don't know why that specific date comes to mind, but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| And we talked about things that we could do that wouldn't take us to wait on TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Sometimes TDOT takes a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| There's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| So all this happened, and then last week a tragic event happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| and basically it shined a little bit of light on this entire situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| But during that, I'd like to give a round of applause to Jim Stoden, wherever he may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| He continued working on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Jim Stoden, along with Mayor Jacobs and myself, went out to the property last week at the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| which you can see, of Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| And next year, or I'm sorry, this coming up summer when the kids are gone from school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| we're going to be able to put in a crosswalk across the state route at Mayville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| You're going to come over in front of the Weigel's and have another walkover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and we're going to have a sidewalk that's ADA compliant all the way down to the back entrance of Halls High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| I've lived in Knoxville my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| I'm 36 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I've been in Halls for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| This has been needed for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| And Ms. Miscorrect, I hate that it took something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| but I'm so thankful that it wasn't a tragedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and I'm glad that your child is going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Thank you both for coming here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| But more than anything, I ask my members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| we're going to be voting on this for these funds coming up in our next budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and this is something that we can act quickly on in the summer of 2020 and that we can get completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| Obviously, I'm lobbying for this to happen, but it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| So thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| If you have any questions, I can entertain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's something that I feel like I just wanted to give you a visual of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| but this is not the first time that this has happened at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| There was a child that was hit there last year and two years previous to that, another incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you for giving me the time to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Any other questions for Commissioner Biggs or comments about this in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Madam Clerk, we will, again, move it into the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| I think that puts us at item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| We don't have any drives and roads nor line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| We have 107 notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| A motion for approval by Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Any spread of record items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| We have no spread of record items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| So, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Mr. Chairman, could I go back to the discussion item just briefly before we move along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Could I ask Jim Stone and Russ Oaks if you would mind joining us at the podium real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you for allowing me to back up just half a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| The discussion item that came up about pedestrian safety in our schools, there are several other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=1991)|
| 0:33:20| I know Commissioner Daley has worked on one in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| I've been working on one, talking to Commissioner Smith about one in the Dutchtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Has anybody done a comprehensive review of pedestrian safety across all of our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| So, this isn't just a one-off as we react when things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Have we done anything like that to really assess the whole walkability and pedestrian safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:49| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| As a school system, we've looked on campus, but we haven't looked beyond campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| We have done some that are around the more urban areas as far as we've done a Phase I and a Phase II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| walk-to-school prioritization analysis that did result in some sidewalks being added along Emory Road out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| for the Powell Middle School as well as some crossing there at Cedar Bluff from the apartments over from the east side to the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| So, we have done that and we're actually continuing to do some of that periodically as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| I'd add Blue Grass School. We've got those. They're really popular with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| I feel like as things come up, whether they be incidents of accidents or we as commissioners come across things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| it continues to kind of come up in piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Government is inherently perfect at being reactive to things after they've happened instead of being proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| I'm not asking for a resolution or anything tonight, but I'd like to encourage the two of you maybe to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| and see what it would take. We don't need to do a big huge to-do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| but what would it take to have somebody do a little bit of a comprehensive study of all of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| to say perhaps there's a bigger pedestrian safety package of items that could go before a mayor and go before a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| We could look at six or eight or ten or twenty projects instead of waiting until they happen to come up in front of our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| or in this case in accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| If you don't mind, Commissioner, we'll be updating the general plan very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| With that, we'll have a comprehensive transportation study and road plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| I'm sure that will be a component of that, correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| So we'll make sure we work that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you very much. I think you'll find a very welcoming audience from this commission to get ahead of this safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| So thank you for the update. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I'll be clear. While I was looking forward, multiple lights came on, especially over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| and I'm not sure what order they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| So I'm going to start with Commissioner Anders and work my way down the line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Go ahead, Commissioner Anders, and then come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Yeah, a little historical. I mean, there's several projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| There was a list of 15 or 10 or 15 projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| One of them is Gray-Hendrix Road in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Several more safety projects that the county has wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| And just to be quite honest with you, we don't have the political guts to say we need to spend some money to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And they're there. The list has been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| We've talked about Gray-Hendrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Jim did do some work on Gray-Hendrix for us with a new subdivision and a sidewalk on school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| But they're out there, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| And the list has been sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| I mean, we do need to update the study because some work has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| But, you know, when I came on commission, Gray-Hendrix was like number 8 or 10 on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Now they're number 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| We're not going to sit up here and fool ourselves and say that we're, I mean, we've said it and we've said it and we've said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| It's time to get a safety plan around our schools and fund it and quit talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2220)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you, Commissioner Anders. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| About three weeks ago, I was out there called by news media to meet out there to take a look at what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| When I first heard about the accident, I went out there and surveyed the roads that we were on right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| You talked about the parental zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| The parental zone was made by the schools to where no school buses were going to be allowed in that mile radius around the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| However, in the county, you have little roads like Ledgerwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| You have places around Copper Ridge that's on the backside of the county that has this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2263)|
| 0:37:53| What it will take to fix all these problems is going to be quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| And I'm not saying a child's life's not worth spending the money, but we've got to do something right now to stop what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| Now, by that, when I was talking to you, Kelly, over the phone, Katie, Kelly, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2289)|
| 0:38:23| But when I talked to you, I said we're going to have to educate the two people right now because nothing's happening right now over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| As Brad said, we've addressed these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Even the new school that we built out there in the area are expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Ricky McLeod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| There's sidewalks all the way around that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| But you can't find a cross pattern to where the kids can get in that pattern to cross across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| That's a state thing that they have to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| The back of the school at Halls High School, we put up signs, but we put no specific thing out there to say this is where the kids are going to be crossing at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2339)|
| 0:39:09| The signs are very predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| It tells you what speed you're supposed to be at and what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| But we cannot keep, unless we educate not only the children about how to cross the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2356)|
| 0:39:25| but the adults, when they're driving, what to look for, drive defensively when they're in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2365)|
| 0:39:35| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Ma'am, what I'm saying is this problem is out there and we're trying to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And again, like Mr. Andrews said, we've got to take the guts and spend the money where we need to put it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| But we just keep talking and kicking the can on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And we've had this accident happen two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| But the only thing that we can do right now to help address that is to address both two people, the young people and especially the drivers when they're in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2396)|
| 0:40:10| And even where Ricky McLeod's at, when that sign's flashing out on the road, I've driven through there at the 25 mile an hour zone and been passed by five or six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2410)|
| 0:40:20| And we cannot do anything unless we get in there and stop those people from speeding in school zones to help protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2420)|
| 0:40:29| But then we've got to find a way to get the kids across streets that were 30 and 35 years ago, but it's not like they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2429)|
| 0:40:38| And that's what we've got to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| We've got to go back and fix the problems that never were fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| So we've got to take that on our shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| When I talk with school administrators in my district, one of the biggest, if not the biggest concern that they have has to do with pedestrian safety around the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2451)|
| 0:41:02| In terms of sidewalks, crosswalks, and street lighting, especially during times of year like this or like a few weeks ago when it's really, really dark in the mornings or even after games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2462)|
| 0:41:15| We had an accident at Gibbs High School two weeks ago after the Gibbs Central game that could have been a fatality where a pedestrian was hit by a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| I don't think, just in what Commissioner Anders said, I don't think there is a more important issue that we could study comprehensively as a commission with the mayor's office, engineering, and the school system than safety in the parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2484)|
| 0:41:41| To comprehensively study it, prioritize, and spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I guess one of the biggest problems in the rural area, and a lot of my schools are in the rural area, is these parents that are probably in the parental zone, they come pick up their kids and they're parking in the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2511)|
| 0:42:03| There are so many of them that they're lined up out of the school driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Bonnie Kate is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And they're backed up on Twin Creek, Martin Mill, all the way up to Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| And Mr. Snowden knows this is going to—I'm surprised we had a major car wreck, car accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| So I don't know if any other commissioners have that problem in their rural zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| But with Bonnie Kate, Mount Olive, I'm thankful to Sheriff Spangler, if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| He helped us out over at Mount Olive to keep kids across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| We've got a crossing guard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| But, you know, in this study, we need to look at also—am I saying the parental zone is a bad thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| I'm saying we might need to look at it to get some more of these kids on a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| The bus is going to the school anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Maybe that will slow down some of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| At 7 o'clock in the morning, you've got to sit and park on Tipton Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| and wait for the cars, for the kids to get out of their cars, inch forward a little bit at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| Same thing at 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| So I think that's another problem that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| And I just want to reiterate what all my fellow commissioners have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| I think we are all on the same page and that we all believe that our kids are most important in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2607)|
| 0:43:37| And we spend dollars, although we're not quite to where we are to be, on their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| But we've got to make sure we have that safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| And when I say safety, I mean also in the building, where those children feel as safe as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| Because if they don't feel safe inside, they can't learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| So that's why our safety issues involve inside the school, in the buildings, and outside of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| And where my district, all of my schools that I represent are past city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| But as our county has grown, what used to be our city schools have become larger in the fact that the people live out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:29| And one particular area is Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| And as we all know, Tazewell Pike is a state road, city road, and county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| And I have a huge issue with, because city, county, state, everybody wants to, you know, who's responsible for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| Who's going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| But I know Christenberry, I know Sturkey, I know Fountain City School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and Shannondale has become, and a good girlfriend of mine years and years ago was hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2694)|
| 0:45:04| and critically, critically on Tazewell Pike getting off the school bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| because there was only a few houses up there that they had to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| And I have never forgotten that because they were very close to our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| But what I want to say is, and this is an issue with all of the Fountain City area, with the traffic, with Gresham and Sturkey and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| is everybody knows which ways to go, what time of the day to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| And for just for instance, Briarclift, Villa, and Shannondale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| But now Shannondale Road has become backed up on Tazewell Pike during the day when school lets out and of the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:50| And so this has been a huge concern for my constituents as well as mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2750)|
| 0:46:00| I know we don't get that many children walking to school, but we get a lot of pickup and just getting them to the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| And one of my big concerns is also the safety for our school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Once our children get on the buses, I have so many more school buses turning left to go up Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| where when I went to Shannondale, we didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So we all are saying, what's it going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| And it is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| We all know it's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| But we've all got to get together and decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| We've got to make sure our kids and our parents, that we make it as safe as possible for them around our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| And it's going to take everybody working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So I want to say praise the Lord that your child is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| And my heart goes out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| And I can say, every one of our commissioners and our mayor and everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| we have to make sure that Knox County keeps our kids as safe as possible in all things, school buses, picking up, walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| And I really feel like you have 100 percent of our commissioners there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Mr. Chair, I think you received an e-mail earlier last week from a constituent whose children go to Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2839)|
| 0:47:29| It was forwarded on to me by Board of Education member Jennifer Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| And it deals with the students that live in the southern part, the southern eastern section of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| If you're familiar with that area, there is a crosswalk that goes across at the back entrance off of Middlebrook to Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2865)|
| 0:47:55| The problem with the structure of this is if these kids want to get to a signalized place to cross the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| they have to stay on the south side and walk without a sidewalk up to Francis, then cross Francis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| then cross Middlebrook, and then come back across Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I know that the previous commissioner from the 4th District and I looked at trying to get some kind of signalization at that intersection there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2892)|
| 0:48:23| where kids could go straight across the sidewalk side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| There is sidewalks on the northern section of Middlebrook there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| This is a fairly simple fix, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| It's not the sidewalks are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| We just need signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| The problem we ran into is like many of our schools, they're in the city on a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| So I was wondering, Jim, how much does it cost to put some kind of signal system on a four-lane state highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2927)|
| 0:49:00| Yeah, Commissioner, is it at – so it's not at any – it's a mid-block crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| There's no intersection or anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| There's a road coming out called West Hills Road, and straight across from it is the Middlebrook Pike back entrance into Beard Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| There's a couple different options you can use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| One is kind of like what we did that the Chair Nystrom mentioned, which is what we have at Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| that kind of – that allows the motorists to have some flashing indications, but it doesn't actually stop traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| And those on a four-lane median divided probably run anywhere between, I'd say, $50,000 or $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| This isn't huge money, but the problem is at Cedar Bluff, Ebenezer, those were our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2982)|
| 0:49:50| We had free range to do what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| How hard would it be to get the state to agree to let us do something like that or help us with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| They would be supportive of it if, you know, the county or the city – I don't know if that particular section of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| I think it may be in the city right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| It is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| If the city traffic engineering was supportive of it, I would think that the local traffic office at TDOT would be also supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| One of the other things you can do, and there's none of these actually in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| but there's hawk signals that are used in other areas that actually – instead of like what's on Peters that require –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3018)|
| 0:50:27| that don't stop traffic, there's actually – they have red, yellow, and green indicators to where they actually physically stop the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| much like a traffic signal would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Those are a little more expensive, but on a busy road like Middlebrook, that might be a more appropriate application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Those are in the 150 range, if I remember, because I think that's what we looked at a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| Yeah, and I think on a state highway with that kind of pedestrian volume and vehicle volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| that would probably be what you would want to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Mr. Oaks, are you here still, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3056)|
| 0:51:11| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Good, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| In this email, the citizen that sent the email said that there was a cross guard in a car there but didn't get out of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:23| Do you actually use a cross guard in that section there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| The school system doesn't do crossing guards. It's local law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| Okay. All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Thanks, Commissioner Smith. Okay. Moving on, any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Okay. Madam Clerk, next item. I think we're on the educational consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3105)|

| 1:04:35| I know. I just said to our law director. Make a motion that the chairman can't tell his jokes more than twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| And third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| All right. Go ahead, Neal. Thank you. And if you could please state your name and address for the record, Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| All right. And then I'll call on Carson. Would you like to introduce Neal? I know you didn't invite him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| I would just like for Commissioner Smith to explain what his purpose is behind it so Neal can get caught up on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| Okay. If that's okay with you, sir. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| Okay. I'm going to do something I normally don't do, and that's be a little bit long winded. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| I'll be reading from the Tennessee law and resource pertaining to the definition of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| I don't know if any of you all received this. I think we had this at a time in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| I've gotten that from the Farm Bureau. I think it came out earlier, and I'm happy to resend out an extra copy of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| Okay. Well, basically it is seven points and a bunch of Attorney General's opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| And Section 1, Agricultural, means the land building and machinery used in the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3935)|
| 1:05:46| On the second session, Tennessee law explicitly prohibits counties from regulating agricultural activities in 5-1-118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3946)|
| 1:06:00| County powers shared with municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| This is A. Counties, by resolution of their respective legislative bodies, in addition to powers authorized by general law or private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3964)|
| 1:06:14| may exercise the following powers granted to all or certain municipalities by the following code sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| Now, I was reading this while everybody else was at the Garth Brooks concert, and I don't have access to LexisNexis at my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3980)|
| 1:06:32| But there is section, and I'd ask the Law Director's Office to look these up for me so that I can get some basis on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| Section 62-201, 3, 8, 10, 13, 18, 19, 26, and 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=3999)|
| 1:06:47| Section 6-54-103, Section 6-54-101, Section 654-307, and Section 6-54-601, 654-603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4007)|
| 1:07:06| Under Part C, it says, in addition to these powers granted to counties pursuant to the subsection A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| any county may, by adoption of a resolution by two-thirds vote of their respective legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| exercise those powers granted to all or certain municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| Section 62-201, 22, and 23, except as provided in Section B and Subdivisions C, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| Any such regulations shall be enacted by a resolution passed by two-thirds vote of the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4053)|
| 1:07:45| The powers granted to counties in this subdivision apply within the unincorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| And then you go on to Section 4, and it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| Tennessee law explicitly prohibits counties from requiring building permits for buildings used for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| And this talks about farmhouses being an incidental part of the property of a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4085)|
| 1:08:15| And what I found very strange about this is if you interpret this very broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| you could buy a half acre of land in a subdivision that doesn't have restrictions, deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| or homeowner association bylaws, and you could go plant a garden and put some chickens on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| and then a year later you could come back and build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| and when the codes people come by that tell you you need a permit, you can tell them you don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| But then it goes on and talks about farm property as it's used for taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| and it's a 15-acre with $1,500 minimum for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| And then it goes on to a bunch of different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| And I won't bother you with most of them because they deal with sawmills, animal feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| and things that don't pertain to what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| The section on opinion on buildings used by farmers does in some way relate to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4154)|
| 1:09:25| There is this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| It's in the opinion number 14-79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| The third question is, what is the definition of what constitutes a farm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| Will a farm be defined by acreage, or gross or net amounts of agricultural product produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| and will a family garden qualify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| The answer to that is Tennessee law defines a farm as a tract of land at least 15 acres engaged in the production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| of growing crops, plants, animals, nurseries, floral products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Gross agricultural income averaging at least $1,500 per year over a three-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| and the land building and machinery used in the commercial production of farm products, nursery, and stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| And it goes on and on and gets into agricultural versus agricultural farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| And I read you all this, and there's a public charter being enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| Section one is amended by deleting the word agricultural and substituting instead the phrase agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| as defined in section 13-5022 and 43-1-113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4230)|
| 1:10:41| And now that that is all clear as mud, I'd like to get into what I believe was intent and non-intent of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4241)|
| 1:10:52| I think it's very obvious or safe to assume that this was action taken by the farm lobby industry in order to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| promote, and help farming in the state of Tennessee to keep government out of the farming business of regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4261)|
| 1:11:11| which I totally agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I like food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I like cheap food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| And this helps to produce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| But what I don't think they intended to do was give suburban backyard farmers the same protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4277)|
| 1:11:26| I think that it's, I guess I'll give it to you this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| The simplest way to look at it is if the lobbying farm industry pushed for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| why would they in a capitalist system want to encourage competition from backyard farmers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4299)|
| 1:11:47| You know that the egg producing industry in the state of Tennessee probably is not a big fan of backyard egg producers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| because that cuts into their demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| So I don't think their intent was to protect suburban farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| I'm here not saying we need to do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I just think there needs to be some type of regulation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Right now there is no regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| And I think it can pose a health and safety issue as well as an enjoyment of peace of your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| If you have a house next to you with unregulated amounts of chickens on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| and you're down slope every time it rains, you're getting part of their product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| I would look at the intent of these laws, who they're there to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| and who may be getting protection that wasn't intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| And I'll ask Mr. Denton for his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Well, my name is Neil Denton, 1028 West Glenview Drive, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| That's my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Backyard poultry, backyard chickens, has been a part of our culture for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| If you think about it, it was the original fast food for our farm families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| and for our urban families up until the advent of modern refrigeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| It was a way to keep protein fresh and on the hoof, so to speak, or, I guess, on the feet in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4396)|
| 1:13:25| A couple of points in the legalities I'm not really completely familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| One of the things is the Freedom to Farm Bill, federally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| has made it extraordinarily ticklish on how we regulate agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| And, yes, Tennessee does say a farm is 15 acres with $1,500 worth of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| And part of that, if I'm not mistaken, came from the Greenbelt decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| that they were making on how to defer tax payments is why that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| As far as suburban in the county, it's very difficult to regulate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| but there are some things that you can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| and one of them is certainly nuisance and water quality ordinances, which we have within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| As far as a problem from the manure, most of the things I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| now I've not really researched this, but most of the things I've heard from people in talking about backyard poultry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| the issues with the manure is less of a problem outside than from dog and pet manures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4481)|
| 1:14:50| Because the problems that most people get from poultry litter is when it is in a dried place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| and it becomes a dust and they inhale it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| So if it's outside, it's not as big an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Now, certainly if you have 300 laying hens on a half acre in a subdivision lot near a drainage way, you're going to have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:15| I would really step cautiously into this when you're looking at regulating poultry in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| because there is a lot of folks who are extremely tied to that tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| And a lot of it is for personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| The city has an ordinance for six laying hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| And, of course, we have generally between 25 and 50 kids and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| They do the chick chain project every year here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| where they get 12 birds and they take them home and raise them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| bring back some to auction off at the auction we have at the Carnes Community Fair every year to help pay for raising those hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4552)|
| 1:16:02| It's something we've done here for close, well, actually over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| There was a report given by an extension agent that was here in the early 1900s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| that distributed 35,000 chicks to Knox County school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| Now, I think I would have a lot of trouble if I tried to do that today from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| but he just went to schools and said, here you go, in a much more rural setting than we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| So that's kind of my feeling about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| I really, really encourage young people particularly to get involved in some sort of animal agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| And the one thing that's worked out well for them is the small chicken flocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| No questions, but I mean one antidote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| Right before this meeting I had reached out to the Tennessee Farm Bureau just for some general information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| Commissioner Smith had asked me to, quote, reach out to my connections in the ag industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| And I spoke briefly, literally at like 4.55 before this meeting, and I told her I couldn't extend the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4626)|
| 1:17:16| But Julie Bowling is one of the attorneys for the Farm Bureau, and without having a deep conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| she said, you know, there's a difference between preexisting agriculture on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| and that if you've got somebody who's doing a startup just now jumping into keeping backyard chickens or poultry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| then that's something that could be looked at from the nuisance perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| And that, you know, the Farm Right to Farm Act is not always something that you can use as a bully club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| just to always say that you can do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| And that was the gist of our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| We didn't have a chance to drill down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| But I guess she said you have to look at it differently from people who are just trying to get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| versus somebody that may have been a preexisting farm, just as an antidote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| We didn't talk numbers of chicken or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| It was just about a two-minute conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| I thanked her for calling me back from earlier and said this is a discussion item that we were discussing at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| And one other thing, if I may, that I mentioned, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| developments have the right to put that in the ordinance and covenants of their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| And then any individual who wants to live there, if they sign up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| then they've waived that right to poultry or to any type of considered farm animals in that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| And they can certainly put that in place as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| or develop a community organization to stop that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Yeah, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Being raised as a farm boy many, many years ago and still we got back into the chicken business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| I don't see a problem with having poultry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| If you're there to raise poultry and your subdivision covenants does not allow it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| But if you're there to raise hens for eggs, you're only going to get three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| because they'll give you four, five, six eggs a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| So you don't need no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| The only time you'd want a rooster is what roosters do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| They do two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| They make more babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| They crow and they strut around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| That's about all they're good for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| And, of course, eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| I don't think we have a problem, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| You know, nothing against you or anything, but I don't think we have a problem yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| I don't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| I wouldn't vote for any type of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| We've got a nuisance law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| We've got environmental laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| My chickens are creating problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Tammy's chickens are creating problems by the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| They can sue us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| It's a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| They can sue us for the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| So right now I don't think we have any type of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| So that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I mean, you live out on Government Farmway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| And I do understand that there are deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| and there are covenants within certain subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| It's my understanding that deed restrictions typically and covenants typically have a time frame in which they expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| and if your association is still not together, they will no longer be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| I'm not trying to keep people from having chickens in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| I'm just trying to regulate in a way that you don't bother your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| I mean, if you're on a half acre, third acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| that's a lot different than living on 10, 15 acres and having some livestock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| It's a discussion item regarding information from Tennessee County Commissioners Association, TCCA, on schools and the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4871)|
| 1:21:20| Commissioner Bressler, you brought that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| We had a meeting back in October the 29th where we went over the TCCA agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4885)|
| 1:21:36| and in a couple of things we had Dr. Bill Fox give us some information about the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| And in the transportation, which I'm on and reelected secretary to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| one of the things that we were talking about was the advent of the electric car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| And Ford made an announcement, I think today or yesterday, or not yesterday but maybe Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| that they're having a new pony come out now that's all electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| And they're going to start Mustang, for those of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| I knew what you meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| See, if you're old and gray-headed, you know what a pony means in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| But anyway, they have that, and there's another manufacturer here that's doing their car, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| And it was talked about that Honda and Volkswagen in the next three or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| will be making nothing but pure electric cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| We get our economic drive for our roads and our taxes from gas taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| And that will be going away, and it will probably be going away quickly because a regular engine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| a gasoline engine, has 1,700 parts where an electric engine has 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| It will be more energy efficient and less cost for keep-up on that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4978)|
| 1:23:08| So he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Another thing that Mr. Fox talked about, Dr. Fox, was he said that school pupil is dropping nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:26| There are fewer students coming into school than it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| So that schools are dropping, which will affect our VEP in some counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| Now, Wilson County is still growing because of the industry they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| We're still growing, but our surrounding counties, some of those student population is dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| And he said it's not only in the state of Tennessee, but it's national that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| So we kind of have to look for the future and see are we going to continue to build schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| or are we going to still just follow the population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Are we going to build schools that we can afford in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| He was mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| But anyway, those are some economic problems that we see coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| And I think that we should start looking right now instead of waiting until we finally hit the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| where half the cars on the road are electric and our gasoline revenues are going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| where we can't keep the roads up as we should be keeping them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| So we really need to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| We also should take a look at our budget when we accept roads into the county that that's a future expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5081)|
| 1:24:50| So that's what I want to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| But can I talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| I was going to say, Commissioner Buster, you had another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| While you've got the floor, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Why don't you cover it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| We mentioned this some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| We talked about this pro call or roll call pro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Back then it was about $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| The chairman is always watching to see whose lights goes on and who makes the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| and things of that sort, and it's hard to keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| This new roll call pro is a $4,000 cost now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| It keeps a screen in front of the chairman in queue of what order they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| It also shows that we can all vote at one time instead of calling on one individual to start the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| It also can see other questions that may come out, and he can see that all on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| But the big thing is everything is recorded, shows on the screen and television of how you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| and it gives a complete record to our recorders here to where they're not trying to scramble around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| and make sure they've got everything correctly because it will give them that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| And from my understanding, and I'm not a computer person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| that they could put this in a way where it would type itself off on a record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| you know, like you do on your voicemails now where it puts that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| And like I said, it's $4,000, and it would be a lot easier, a lot quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| and it goes on to our tablets, our computers right here where we can take it with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| So anyway, I just brought this up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| It's a lot less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Everybody around us, Anderson County, Blount County, and all those other counties have this to keep their records on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| Anyway, I would like to see that we get this and put it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Is there any way that we can see a demonstration of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| I think it would be great so we could show the public how people are voting and things of that nature as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| How would we schedule a demo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| I think in the short run, if there's something we'd want to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| and I want to preface this by saying something like this, you'd probably want to include PBA in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| You'd also want to, because if you do something like this, you'd probably want to include the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| the city council, and the county commission, and into the voting bodies that actually use this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| We want to think of something like that as more of a tool for all of the elected bodies as opposed to commission-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| And we can share the costs with the other three bodies as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| I would think next steps would probably be, if we're serious about taking a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| is for some of us maybe to make even a road trip or just see it in action at some other legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| That would be the way I'd look at it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Yeah, the gentleman I talked to would be happy to come by and probably show us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| It's a 15-minute demo on how you can get this online and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Yep, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Next was Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| While we're on the TCCA, I'd like to brag on one of our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker has been elected as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| He's elected as a board member for the Tennessee County Services Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| which is the whole, that's the county commissioners plus the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| And this is the first time this has happened in Nassau County over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker will be responsible for 33 counties and over 500 commissioners and mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| And I just wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| That happened a couple of weeks ago when we had the fall conference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| It's an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| I appreciate the opportunity to continue service for not only our Knox County commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| but our neighbors to the east and south and west and north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| So, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Mr. Chairman, can I do one other thing about TCCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| I meant to do this a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| On March 2nd and 3rd of 2020, we will have Government Day in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| On May 19th through the 21st, we will have legislative conference, post-legislative conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| That's after it's over with to see what bills affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| And then we'll have Rutherford County on October the 21st and 23rd, 2020, will be our fall conference also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5366)|
| 1:29:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| I'm coming back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| I wanted to give you a chance to weigh in if it's on that item specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| On the roll call vote, at the beginning of the month, I took advantage of the county commissioner training that Blount County offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5382)|
| 1:29:51| and had a chance to sit down with their county clerk and discuss how the system works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| And it really, I think the clerk's office has really appreciated that system because now they have a permanent record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5398)|
| 1:30:06| It's so much easier to deal with, and they're just ecstatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| And they were really kind of surprised that Knox County didn't have it because, like Commissioner said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| Loudoun County has it, Blount County has it, and they have, let's see, Blount County has 21 commissioners, and it works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| So it's something we, and definitely now that the price is right compared to what we looked at three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| Well, what I might do, with your all's blessing, I'm going to establish a two-person subcommittee to our Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5433)|
| 1:30:42| I was going to suggest one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| What we may want to do is see if we wanted to just do it for the county commission meetings and the Board of Zoning Appeals meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| since they're controlled by commission, and then if the other entities want to see how we're doing it and then join on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5451)|
| 1:31:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| And I think right now the next step is also just to let everybody here get a chance to even look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| I mean, that might be, Commissioner Schoonmaker, if I don't mind asking you to kind of lead that effort just to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| and Bussler, to kind of get that information, try to invite a guest to come in and speak about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| that would be probably the most appropriate first steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Yes, the price has come down greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| It is now beyond, below the limits of even bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| So it seems to be much more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| I was wondering if it might just be possible to have them come in 15, 20 minutes before our next meeting and give us a demonstration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5492)|
| 1:31:41| That would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, John, if you could get them in here before the work session in December, or Charlie, if you got the contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| see if we can get them in here before the work session in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I think that covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| There was another discussion item, and that was Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| I'm also going to put a reminder on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| That was regarding charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| Go ahead and put your reminder on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| My main reminder is just please don't forget to get your appointee to the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| The sooner we get it in, there is a process that has to be followed where the name has to go over to the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| where they vet it to make sure they're a voter and that they're in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| So it's easier to get everything approved the sooner you get that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Ideally, I'd love to see it get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I think we just talked last week about the Friday before the work session in December would be most helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| So that's my plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| And go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| And as a commission, we also have to vote on each of those nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| So we'll have to go through a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| In reviewing the charter and the section on charter review, I want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| Elected officials can be on the charter review with the exception of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Wah, wah, wah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Madam Clerk, does that cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I know we need to get to setting a public hearing and kind of working our way through the public hearing on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5590)|
| 1:33:20| The amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Isn't that something we can do that in zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| I'm curious, is Brian Hare here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| He's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Hey, Brian, before the meeting, Commissioner Biggs had just mentioned to me, did you visit with Garth Brooks for a little bit before the show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Pretty good story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Would you mind to come up and share the interaction you had with Garth with the body, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| If you've got a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| I heard it would be pretty interesting or it was just insightful and it would be worthy of sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| Short story, talked to Garth for a few minutes, looked at him, said, may I hug you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| He said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Have you showered and washed those clothes since?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| No, I did get to go to his press conference on a Friday and he was talking about how much he really enjoyed getting to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| I talked to Kim Bumpus yesterday and she shared that the tour spoke to her after the concert and said no one rolled out the red carpet like Knoxville has on this tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5654)|
| 1:34:25| Huge kudos to Kim Bumpus and her team for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Did you notice the guy in the newspaper that kind of looks similar to you with the little emblem on the side of his head there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5670)|
| 1:34:40| I think that concludes all of our discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5680)|
| 1:34:49| What I'd like to do is, while we've got just a minute, are there any announcements before we close the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| No announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| Mr. Chairman, I spoke to you about maybe having an opportunity for all of us and our families to maybe go ice skating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5697)|
| 1:35:07| Commissioner Jay brought something to downtown Knoxville and maybe children, grandchildren, or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| Maybe, I don't know if we would just sunshine something or what, but take the opportunity to just have a moment with all of us before Christmas and our families and just all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5716)|
| 1:35:28| I'd just say try to pick a date and I'm sure we can announce it and encourage everybody to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| Commissioner Jay and I will try to pick out a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| If everyone's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| If not, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Last time I skated, I broke something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| I was in a cast for a long time, but I may come as a cheerleader and let Trace skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Angela didn't want to have to take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| No, I think it's a wonderful idea and any time we have an opportunity to kind of spend some time together, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| If you all could just pick a date and we'll have Drusilla kind of get some communication out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191118business?start=5754)|
