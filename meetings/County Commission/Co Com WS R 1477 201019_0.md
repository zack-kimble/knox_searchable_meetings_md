| 0:00:54| If everyone stand and do the proper salute, repeat after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=59)|
| 0:01:07| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=67)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| I want to take a minute to address some personnel changes within Knox County Government and provide the commissioners with an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=81)|
| 0:01:30| Today, I met with Mayor Jacobs, and as you know, he announced the dismissal of the Head of Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| and the resignation of his Chief of Staff as it relates to allegations of wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| I met with the Mayor this afternoon, and he assured me that he is committed to addressing these issues in a proactive and transparent way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| and I commend him for taking swift action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Tennessee Comptroller's Office has now taken the investigative lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| and is having additional work being conducted by Pew and Company, Knox County's auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=116)|
| 0:02:05| While the investigation continues, it appears the Mayor had sufficient information to act quickly and make necessary changes at the highest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| As the legislative branch, it is our responsibility to be informed and to make sure the public is aware of all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| I do have assurances from Mayor Jacobs that he will see the investigation through completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| and sit down with everyone once the findings are concluded so everything can be disclosed publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| I am confident our Mayor and his team will do as they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| will work hard to be open and honest with all of us and make every effort to restore the public's trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| I look forward to both the Comptroller's and Auditor's final reports in the coming weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| and will share additional information with you as I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| The Mayor and his team will not make further comments, nor will I, while the investigation is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| Okay, moving on to our meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| Unless I hear objection from my colleagues, here's how I intend to conduct tonight's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| We will begin with public forum that will last one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| We will then move on to the business of the county as outlined in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| At the end of the work session, we have a second opportunity for an additional one-hour public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| With that, I'm going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| We'll jump right into a lot of people who are here to talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| First, I'm going to call on Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| If you would please approach the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Public forum will last until 6.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Mike Arms, 201 Ivy Gate Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| I'm here to talk about Amendment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| I'm not here to ask you to vote yes or no because that amendment was defeated the day the Law Director wrote the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| and sent it to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Several of us who were on the Charter Committee went to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| and asked them about the language, and they all agreed to the person that it was damned language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| It condemned the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| The first sentence started off, taking away the right of citizens to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| which was the same language that was eight years ago that was also drafted by the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| You would think a Law Director would bend over backwards not to be biased with something affecting his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| but obviously that language put a knife in that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Since then, there's been a lot of information passed out about this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| I just want to talk to you because you are the appropriators of Knox County funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| You're the appropriators of Knox County funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| We have a Law Director's office that has a budget of, I think, $2.1 million, $2.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| another $400,000 of outside attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Undoubtedly, when you chase an issue like the sheriff's compensation plan against the will of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| and against the will of the sheriff and it ends up losing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| and I've got a stack of legal bills that Knox County paid to outside attorneys who represented that party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| So there's much more in legal costs for a Law Director's office that is out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| You may think you have legal counsel, and you do 98% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| but when it gets tough, you may not always have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| I know Mrs. Hill was on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| When I first went on county commission, there was a lawsuit between the county commission and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| I can tell you the school board did not have representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| It was obvious which side the Law Director was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| This proposal would give the mayor counsel, you counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| You have the right to approve the mayor's counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| If the mayor ever wanted to dismiss that counsel, you would also have that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| and the school board would have legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| You can talk about the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| You know, when we passed a charter that reduced the size of this commission from 19 to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| some people thought that was good, some people thought that was bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| but in the first sentence it said do away with the right for citizens to vote on eight county commission seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| I promise you it would have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| It would have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| So what I want you to look at, and I passed out a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| This is factual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| You had three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| The timer wasn't working, but I'm keeping the time up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Twelve counties surrounding us have appointed attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| They represent 712,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Their legal budgets are less than $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| The last paragraph I took directly from the Hamilton County Budget Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| the Hamilton County's county attorney has a budget of $1.09 million in 2019, $1.14 million in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=411)|
| 0:07:00| You look at the function, it's almost exactly what we expect our Law Director to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| So what I would like this commission to look at in the future is simply ask why we have a law director's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| that is bigger than the sum total of the 12 counties around it and also twice as big as Hamilton County's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| And I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| I've talked to these county mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| The Loudoun County mayor, their county attorney is from the law firm Kramer & Rason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| They get a great deal, and they pay for that attorney when they need that attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| Our county commission, when our charter was set up, has gone from 19 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Our law director's office has gone from 5 to 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| So we have a law firm sitting in this building that the taxpayers are paying rent for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| they're paying pension funds for, and that law director's office can chase anything it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| You'll hear frequently that the law director's office represents the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| One of the best cases I can give is when the people voted for term limits by overwhelming majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| and for 13 years the law director's office did nothing to represent those people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| So the law director's office represents the people when they want to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| When they don't want to, they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| You could easily say there's 15,000 signatures on a petition right now about the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| What if they went to the law director and said we're citizens, defend us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| The law director's office is, we're the only county that has it on the ballot over other 90 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| appoint their law director, so all I'm asking you to do is examine that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Ask why we have to have 19 people on that staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| That staff is bigger than the county commission, it's total staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| So I know I've offended a few people, but 63% of the people on that charter voted yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| to move that amendment forward, and like I said, it was condemned on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| I'm going to, sorry I always forget this, but I'm going to do a quick roll call vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| to make sure we have on the record who's here, and then we'll get back to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| Madam Clerk, if you'll please read the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=550)|

| 0:10:12| because the timer isn't working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=612)|

| 0:10:19| I can come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Just get closer to the mic if you could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=622)|

| 0:10:38| My name is Chrissy Stevens, and a friend of mine wanted to speak to you this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| but to protect her privacy and the privacy of her family, she is allowing me to tell you her story instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| I'm here to give a voice to the thousands of Knox County citizens that have been ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| and disregarded by the Board of Health's mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| And before you tune me out, please think about your wives and husbands, mothers and fathers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| sisters, brothers, daughters, and sons, anyone that you may know that has been sexually assaulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| or abused in their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| The first time Sarah was sexually assaulted, she was six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| It was Christmas Eve, and her older cousin snuck into her bedroom where she was trying to stay awake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| listening for Santa, placed a pillow over her face, and began doing unimaginable things to her tiny six-year-old body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=683)|
| 0:11:32| After telling her family about the abuse, she was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Things like that didn't happen in their family, and she was told to just quit being so dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| At age 13, Sarah was having a swim party at a friend's house to celebrate her birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Only close friends and family were in attendance that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| She went inside to use the restroom, and that's when one of those so-called friends forced his way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| into the bathroom where she was, slammed her to the ground, knocked the breath from her body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| held his hand over her mouth and nose, and proceeded to force himself upon her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| When the horror was over, she left the bathroom and asked her parents to leave, and again, she was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| At age 17, she found herself in an abusive relationship with a man that, from all outward appearances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| was a prince, but behind closed doors became a monster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| At least once a week, he held his hand over her mouth and shoved her face into the bed as he violated her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| She stayed because she had been conditioned to put her personal feelings aside and to just endure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| At age 18, Sarah found herself pregnant, and that was her turning point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| She decided to walk out and to get the help she needed so that her child would never be treated the way she had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| Sarah got help anywhere she could, therapy, church, group meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| She is married now with children and has healed from her traumatic past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| An event, however, a couple of weeks ago shook her to her core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Her family went to a place where masks were mandatory, and no exceptions or exemptions were honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| She complied because she wanted her children to have a fun experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| She was fine for a few minutes, and then suddenly all of those gruesome memories from her past came flooding back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| She took her mask off to catch her breath and was immediately verbally assaulted by employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| She was having a full-blown panic attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Her legs didn't seem to want to work as she clung to the wall to try to get to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| She was sweating profusely, and her body was failing her, all the while being followed by employees telling her things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| Mask up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Masks are mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Ma'am, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Quit being so dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Put your mask on or leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| One employee even followed her into the restroom, triggering the horrific memory of the attack she experienced at age 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| Not one employee asked her if she needed medical attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Not one asked if she was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Not one cared that she was hyperventilating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| All they cared about was enforcing a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Those of us that cannot mask due to religious objections or medical, physiological, or psychological reasons are constantly told and reminded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| It's just a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Stop being so dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Do it for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Show that you care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| We are constantly told how selfish we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Do you think that Sarah is selfish for refusing to wear a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Sarah's experience is not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| It is very real, and thousands of men and women in this county have similar stories to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Where is their advocate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| It is certainly not with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| No matter where you stand on the issue of masks, curfews, contact tracing, quarantining, and PCR testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| I believe we can all agree that there is nothing more important than having the right to govern our own bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| And let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| There is nothing more important than having the right to govern our own bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| It is your job to protect that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| It is your responsibility to do the right thing and to give the citizens of Knoxville back their right to choose what to do with their own bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| and how they want to handle a virus that has over a 99% survivability rate and do the brave thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| and that is to take away the 100% unchecked power of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| It is time to stop putting your politics over people, and it is time to dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. Andrew Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Mr. Flores, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| You have five minutes until we get technical, until we get it sorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| I'm going to keep the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I'll try to give you a two-minute mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Pardon the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=957)|

| 0:16:06| I wanted to come before you today, of course, to speak about the Board of Health, but I also wanted to come before you and say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Each one of you comes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Each one of you has a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Each one of you has to listen to the people in each one of your districts, and each one of your districts is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| Each set of individuals is saying something different, and you're tasked with representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| No matter how you feel personally, you have to do this for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| And I think that's important to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| You guys also live, work, and play in Knox County, just like the rest of us, which I think is important for people to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| You are people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| You are citizens as well, and I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| So I want to say thank you, of course, for doing that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| And some people may not agree, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| We're allowed to have a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| I do want to talk about the Board of Health, and I think this is far beyond mass mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| This is far beyond curfews and gathering restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| I think that what we're looking at is a board with unchecked power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Put another name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Call it the Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| What if they had unchecked power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| We'd all be here doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| We'd just be shouting at them and trying to get this under check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Our government has a system of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| No one party has any more power than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| No one party runs unchecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Even the President himself is checked by the rest of the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| The Supreme Court gives interpretations based on laws being passed, or the laws being passed by legislation are interpreted against the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| So no one individual body has unlimited power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| No one body has the ability to govern all the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| And no one body is able to govern the people without recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| That's what we're seeing with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| They're doing the best they can in the situation they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| We're beginning to see their true colors and how they act and how they think and how they vote towards certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| And we also put them in context that they're a medical board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| They're medically minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| They view the world through that lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| But I don't think that you can govern the world through the lens of the medical world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| I think that that is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| That's why we have a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| That's why we have county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| This is why we take votes and how we pass laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| What I'm suggesting is that we bring this power back under the commissioners or back under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| That each of you gets a vote for your district, voting however they decide you should vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| And you're casting that vote either for or against mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And you know what, maybe you guys vote for masks and maybe we're unhappy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| But in the end, the right thing has been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| We have a way of going about checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| We have a way of speaking to you like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| The Board of Health currently has the minimum amount of public forum possible, which is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| Because if you watch new videos, you do notice that they kind of fidget a bit and it doesn't look like they're really tuned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| But I would be nice to be able to speak to them like this in front of all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Look in your eyes and say what we think and have them actually hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| I mean, if you have to be here until 1.42 or 1.28 in the morning, why shouldn't they have to be here until 1.28 in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| I think that that is important and that they should have to follow suit like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| I don't think they should be special in being able to avoid public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| I also think that it makes them connect to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| It makes it connect to us, to hear from us, not just ten people at three minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| So thank you again for the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| And I look forward to seeing what you're going to put on the agenda for this coming vote for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you, Mr. Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1223)|

| 0:20:54| So it's our duty as citizens to scrutinize the actions of its elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| When we disagree, we should let them know, and when we agree, we should applaud them for doing the job we elected them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| When I hear a Tennessee state senator claim in a Knox News article that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| politicians who are too focused on protecting civil liberties while combating the coronavirus are misguided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| or those kinds of statements, I don't know that I agree with because freedom doesn't do you a lot of good if you're dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| That reminds me of a quote from H.L. Mencken, which reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| The urge to save humanity is almost always a false face to rule it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Senator Briggs made that statement, or those statements, and I wonder what country he thinks he lives in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1304)|
| 0:21:53| because this is not Cuba, this is not Venezuela, this is not Romania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| This is personal for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| This is not what the Constitution states, and he knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1320)|
| 0:22:11| Dr. O'Brien, in his ambition to force testing on students, thinks it's a great idea to bring in the National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1331)|
| 0:22:22| Does he think he lives in Cuba as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| My thought is that these physicians think that their position affords them a certain position in society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| that gives them more of a voice than the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Well, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Each individual has a vote, we have a voice, and we are all subject to the same laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| It's infuriating that they think they can bully people who they think they're smarter than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| It's not right, and that's why we're here tonight, is to point out that the law is not being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1380)|
| 0:23:09| The Knoxville County Board of Health has unlimited powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| They should not have unlimited powers under our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| We should have the right to scrutinize their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Mr. Jay posted a picture on Facebook where he was at a meeting and not wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| and claimed they were social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1411)|

| 0:23:36| The point is, one of the quotes when questioned about it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| I take responsibility for my own actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| I'm paraphrasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Isn't that what each of us wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Each of us has the right to do as adults, as citizens of this county, and of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| We have the right to make the decisions that are best for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| There is, the science in this matter is very divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| I'm a retired medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| I know how to do research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| My husband is a medical professional of pretty high esteem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| I don't speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I speak for myself, and he respects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| My point is, there are doctors around the world who disagree with shutdowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| and there's multiple documentation to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| There is, even the CDC even states that in multiple papers that I've written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1485)|
| 0:24:54| and I can produce documentation to anyone who would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| I have done mountains of research in the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| They state that quarantining the healthy people actually put the elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1502)|
| 0:25:12| and immunocompromised at higher risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| because the people who are normally taking care of themselves and staying home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| the elderly and the infirmed, they're doing what they normally have to do to stay safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| But because of the shutdowns, people who are now forced into the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| they're running out to get essential supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Well, they're coming into contact and bringing it back into the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1535)|

| 0:27:13| So often I hear it being said that we should trust the experts, implying that the experts all agree that lockdowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1633)|

| 0:27:23| I'm here tonight to let you know what experts who are in disagreement with these measures have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| by reading excerpts from the Barrington Declaration released on October 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| It reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| and recommend an approach we call focus protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Coming from both the left and the right and all around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| we have devoted our careers to protecting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short- and long-term public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than 1,000-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1697)|
| 0:28:26| We know that populations will eventually reach herd immunity, i.e., the point at which the rate of new infections is stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| The most compassionate approach that balances the risk and benefits of reaching herd immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection while better protecting those who are at highest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| We call this forced focus protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| Simple hygiene measures, such as handwashing and staying home when sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Young, low-risk adults should work normally rather than from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Restaurants and other businesses should open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Arts, music, sport, and older cultural activities should resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| People who are more at risk may participate if they wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| while society as a whole enjoys the protection confirmed upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| All of this sounds good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Here are the bios of the three co-authors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Dr. Martin Koldoff, professor of medicine at Harvard University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| He's a biostatistician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| He's an epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and vaccine safety evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Dr. Sunetra Gupta, professor at Oxford University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| He's also an epidemiologist with expertise in immunology, vaccine development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Dr. Jay Bachara, professor at Stanford University Medical School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| A physician, another epidemiologist, health economist, and public health policy expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| focusing on infectious diseases in vulnerable populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| These people are highly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| They are international experts, yet we looked at these experts on our unelected board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| As of today, nearly 30,000 medical practitioners have signed on to the Barrington Declaration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| and over 10,000 medical and public health scientists have also signed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| This only happened a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| More are signing on every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| But here in Knox County, yet here in Knox County, we are allowing an unelected board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| that has no epidemiologist, no health economist, and no immunologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| to dictate what our citizens can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| We are here tonight as courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| We don't want to be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| We're bored of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| We're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| We have come every month since August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| You're tired of hearing of us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| So put something on the agenda tonight for next week, or there will be lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| This is not a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| This is a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Ms. Murphy, Andy Fox, and Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1856)|
| 0:31:08| Sherry Garrett, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I will give you a two-minute warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| I live at 7900 Sharp Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| I am a daughter, a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| I have taken care of my own health and my family's health for the last 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| Thirty years ago, I became a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I've worked in long-term care, obstetrics, med-surg, and cardiology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| I've worked in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, doctor's offices, and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| I've even worked at the county jail as a nurse for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| That was an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I'm an average citizen and a follower of Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| I've lived in Knox County all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| My parents and grandparents were born here, as was most of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| And most of them still live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| What I cannot understand is the lack of common sense, critical thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| and amount of apathy in our community, and definitely in this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| You have been well aware that the existence of the Board of Health is unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| yet you have refused to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| When I or my friends speak to many of you individually, you each tell us you're supportive of dissolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| yet seem to be afraid to stand up for what is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| stand up for the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| and for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| By simply refusing to dissolve this unconstitutional board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| you are complicit in everything they are doing and will do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Do you have any idea what that could look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Let me tell you about last week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| They're concerned about not enough citizens being tested, so there's a concern about staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| So Dr. O'Brien suggests bringing in the National Guard to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Other states and neighborhoods are going door-to-door, testing people door-to-door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| So is that going to happen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I mean, they even stated it in their last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| on what's going on in other cities and other states, including Arizona,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| and not on data based on Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Dr. Shemio wonders what further measures would look like if cases keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Closing nonessential businesses, targeted closures and curfews, gathering sites, and staying home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| Are you willing to let them go that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| If you don't think they won't, you're dead wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| They've already shown no regard for this commission and the resolution you passed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| They knew it had no teeth. You knew it had no teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| They knew it was not enforceable, and so did you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| And believe me, they and the media made sure everyone else knew it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| You know, I watch those meetings with the Board of Health every week, every two weeks now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| and the media briefing's twice a week, and all I hear about are cases, cases, cases are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| We currently have 64 people in this county hospitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and I'm extremely disappointed that I hear nothing about treatment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| The board and the health department are supposed to be about public health, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| I had a friend of mine tell me the other day when he asked a nurse what to do if he got COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| She told him there wasn't anything he could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| He'd have to ride it out until he got sick enough to go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| How can any medical professional not know there are treatment options available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Thank God I already know what to do if I got COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I already take vitamin A, vitamin D, C, and zinc and quercetin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| I get sunshine every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I eat a healthy diet with no sugar or white processed flour, and I exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| But what do I hear from the so-called public health experts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Crickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| And if someone gets it, there are therapeutics that are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2080)|

| 0:34:47| But all you hear from the board of health and the health department is wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| wash your hands, social distance, stay home if you're sick, and sanitize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| If that were the case, then according to the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| how did 70.4% of the people who contracted COVID always wore a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| This is all bull, and you know it, and they know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| They push this propaganda out through the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| and yet they refuse to talk about the real things that could be helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| So we know this is not about helping people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| because if it were, they would be speaking about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Instead, you're pushing face masks on people that are unhealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Did you know in Michigan they had to shut down an entire school because the kids got strep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| How'd they get strep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| They were social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| They were wearing masks, yet breathing into a wet, foggy, humid mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| that is catching all that bacteria and breathing it right back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| These are literally making people sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| and the fact that the board of health and this county commission is continuing this political theater is disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| That lady has sung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2143)|

| 0:36:14| It takes courage to do what's right as an elected official, but as a member of the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| sometimes formulating public policy is more than simply weighing stacks of papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| You have people on one side of an issue, people on another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and you say, well, how in the world can we always know what's right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| I'll have courage to do what's right, but how do we know what's right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Well, there are, I would suggest to you, three guiding principles to assist you in knowing what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| or how to proceed correctly, and this is the way to keep meddlesome, agitating lawyers out of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| Number one, government has boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Number two, government must keep its promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Number three, government must operate according to the procedures established by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I'll say those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Government has boundaries, government must keep its promises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and government must operate according to the procedures established by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| And I want to give you some examples of how I think government recently in Knox County has violated these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| and what's happening right now as a result of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| I'll start in reverse order with regard to government not following the procedures that were established by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| I'm sure you're familiar with RECODE and the comprehensive zoning update for Knoxville, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| Well, there was a lawsuit filed about that seeking to have RECODE declared void ab initio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| for not following the procedure laid out in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I filed that lawsuit, and Knoxville, or just recently, Knoxville tried to get it dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| said I failed to state a claim in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| They lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| And so now I'm going to be able to get into their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I'm going to be able to conduct discovery on city council members and on the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| to find out why they didn't think it was necessary to first change the one-year plan before implementing a new zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| So that's an example of where government did not follow the procedures that were clearly laid out in the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| With regard to government not keeping its promises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| well, a recent example of that is Casswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| I'm sure you're probably familiar with the situation in Casswell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| where the city of Knoxville wanted to give away property to Volunteer Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| a property that was zoned and had a use of recreation for Casswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| And I was involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Now, this is the first time I've really expressed this publicly, but I've told a handful of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| I was the person that basically engineered the capitulation of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| because I had a hunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Some activists came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I had a hunch that if federal dollars were involved in the refurbishment of that park back in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| that probably they were not going to be able to just willy-nilly change the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| the usage of that land in order to give it to Volunteer Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Me and an activist and I researched it one night over a 45-minute, hour-long phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| And we looked and we researched the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| and found out that dollars were devoted to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| And I told them then, well, you need to do a Freedom of Information Act request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| in order to ensure that this particular tract of land was involved in original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| They did that, and all of a sudden you found that the city was no longer trying to impose that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| that the city was forced to keep its promise that it made to the citizens 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| that this was going to be park property, even if it's intended for a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| There are limitations, and that goes towards the first statement that I made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| which is government has boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| It doesn't matter how good of a policy that you're seeking to impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Sometimes you just can't do it because government has boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| You could have the greatest policy in the world, make everybody a million dollars a year if you could impose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| but if it's outside of the boundaries that are established through the Constitution or the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| You're going to get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| And, you know, with regard to that, right now there's an understanding or a belief, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2418)|
| 0:40:28| a belief that Jacobson v. Massachusetts is protecting the current policy of mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| and that gives a safe harbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| I want to suggest to you a few reasons why I believe that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Number one, Jacobson v. Massachusetts applied to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| It placed a constraint, or the finding of the court was that the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| there was no basis in the U.S. Constitution to allow for – two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| No, 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Number two, well, that only applied to federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| That was decided for the evolution of modern rights, such as the right of bodily integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Think Roe v. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| There are other rights of bodily integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| And I want to note that Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist established that the U.S. Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| is a floor for the rights of Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| You're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The Tennessee Constitution exceeds that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Number three, Jacobson applied to a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Sir, you're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Okay, well, now Mr. Henry said he was going to give me his time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| so I don't know if that makes a difference to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| We have a long list of people, and Mr. Henry is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Well, I want to note it's up to the board to self-regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I mean, it's up to this commission to self-regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| and you have an opportunity to do so before a lawsuit gets in your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2506)|

| 0:41:54| Less than Daryl Ann Cummings and Valerie Armfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| If you would, Mr. Thomas, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| There's a big timer right above me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| My name is Robert Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| I live at 6206 Babley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| Commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| But who I really need to thank are the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| It is the people of Knox County who have allowed me to come and speak here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| After all, this is their forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2540)|

| 0:42:31| What troubles me then when I learned about an October 8th meeting between Chairman Larson Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| Vice Chairman John Shoemaker, Commissioners Randy Smith, Kyle Ward, and Carson Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| where a potential rules change was discussed to limit this forum to 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| And during that discussion, it was noted that, well, this is what the Board of Health does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| I would say it's a shameful day when the elected members of this commission look up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| and take their cues from the Board of Health as to how to conduct a forum that belongs to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| not to the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I'm told that there will be a meeting on October 20th at 1,300 hours to further discuss such rules changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| I would propose to you that such a rules change would be an act of cowardice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| I understand that there is a limit to discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and I would remind each and every commissioner that you have the ability to, at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| move that discussion be closed or that any meeting come to an adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| I also understand it takes a measure of courage to stand up and look at the people of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| say we're tired of hearing what you have to say, it's late, and we need to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| But if your convictions stand, you'll have that courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| And this rules change would be an act of cowardice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| That being the case, I want to come to my second and final point for the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2637)|

| 0:44:48| then I, by every legal recourse I have, actively seek to make sure that they never held public office again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2688)|
| 0:44:58| I am represented at the state level by Ms. Massey, Mr. Wright, and the legislature and the executive, Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2698)|
| 0:45:09| Perhaps such an act of cowardice has already occurred where they allowed power to be shifted to an unelected board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2709)|
| 0:45:18| whereby rule of law was usurped over the people without their consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| And if I deem that is the case, I will use every legal recourse within my means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| to make sure that they are never elected to any public office ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=2729)|

| 0:52:08| Two weeks ago, you said, oh, we condemn the health department for what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| But you didn't stand up and say, you guys need to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| I will let you go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3140)|

| 0:52:25| Please do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Darrolyn Cummings, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| For the record, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| I'm Darrolyn Cummings, 6640 Grace Nicely Lane, Coryton, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| I share in the sentiments of Mr. Flores earlier, and I thank all of you for allowing us to be here, to hear me tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| to allow me this opportunity to talk, and I thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| I'd like to begin with a quote from one of my favorite authors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I'm a book nerd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Wendell Berry, he's a novelist, an essayist, a poet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| He's also a Kentucky farmer, an environmental activist, and a cultural critic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| He has an astounding ability with words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I appreciate his insight in many ways of public and community life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| He's a man of integrity and a great respect for the love of his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Here are his thoughts on community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| A community identifies itself by an understood mutuality of interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| but it lives and acts by the common virtues of trust, goodwill, forbearance, self-restraint, compassion, and forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3207)|
| 0:53:36| If it hopes to continue long as a community, it will wish to, and will have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| encourage respect for all its members, human and natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| It will encourage respect for all stations and occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Such a community has the power, not invariably but as a rule, to enforce decency without litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| It has the power that is to influence behavior, and it exercises this power not by coercion or violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| but by teaching the young and by preserving stories and songs that tell, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| what works and what does not work in a given place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| We're all part of a special community here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I have only lived here for five years, but I came from Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| and I came here hoping to hate it because I loved my home, but I love it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| It's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I'm a homeschooling mother of five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| I have a vested interest, and I wish to preserve this community for today and for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| I don't need to stand here and repeat all the reasons that have already been said by many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| over the last few meetings as to why I believe we need to dissolve the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| I think you've been giving plenty of information, and it's evident that we have a huge problem on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| Currently, the health board that you all have the power to dissolve is causing a division and strife within our special community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3297)|
| 0:55:07| You, our elected commissioners, have a duty to protect the overall health of the Knox County community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| Please put this discussion on the table tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Choose to talk about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| We, the people, are asking you to dissolve the board that is not considering and respecting a huge part of the community's population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3318)|
| 0:55:27| Help us keep unnecessary coercion, litigation, and violent force out of this community by all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| This discussion must happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I will end with one last quote from this man, Wendell Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| A community is not merely a condition of physical proximity, no matter how admirable the layout of the shopping center and the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| no matter if we demolish the horizontal slums and replace them with vertical ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| A community is the mental and spiritual condition of knowing that the place is shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| and that the people who share the place define and limit the possibilities of each other's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| It is the knowledge that people have of each other, their concern for each other, their trust in each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| the freedom with which they come and go among themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| Our final speaker in public forum for this session of the public forum will be Valerie Armfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| Valerie, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| This will be the final speaker for this session of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| We'll continue with the list in the second half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Valerie Armfield, 10931 Woodford Bend Way in Surrogate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| I have emailed all of you numerous times regarding my concerns about the Board of Health and their ability to make mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3402)|
| 0:56:52| But I really felt led to appear tonight to let you know that I am a real person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| And so you could put a face with a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| I'm not a political activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I'm a grandma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| I'm not a radical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I don't shout slogans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| And I'm not rude to those who have differing opinions because I understand what I do and what I say must be glorifying to God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3429)|
| 0:57:20| I have been and I continue to be active in our community by serving the elderly and the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| But truthfully, this is my first time to be involved with local issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| The Board of Health matter was that alarming to me that I could not ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| I had to step out of my comfort zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I honestly thought, and this is, of course, in my opinion, I thought this was like a dictatorship, that it could not and would not happen in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3463)|
| 0:57:54| Three generations of my family have served this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| And I want to honor their service and all the others that have fought for our freedom and form of government by speaking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3478)|
| 0:58:08| The Board of Health has created an atmosphere of fear in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| Even among very close friends of mine, who whenever they hear some statistic about someone dying, they send me a text to let me know I was the cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3493)|
| 0:58:25| For me, it is not just a face mask or social distancing issue, although that is very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| But the greater concern is our personal freedom to make our own health care decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| Unelected officials are telling us what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| I have been in the health care industry for over 40 years, mostly alternative health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| And I have seen traditional medicine attempt to discredit anything other than their way and prescribing drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| I want the freedom to choose my path to health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| And it scares me to think that you have given that power to unelected bureaucrats who create mandates according to their wishes, to their agenda, to their fears and their perceived intellectual superiority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3544)|
| 0:59:22| There was one political maxim which really comforts me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| The Lord reigns. He is not a God of fear, so I will not give in to fear regarding COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| I will be respectful and I will take precautions, but I do not live in fear and isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| The number of days that God has preordained for my life, please dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3589)|
| 1:00:13| Commissioners, we're going to move on to item number four on our agenda, which is amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| I'm going to break down the additions, deferrals, withdrawals, and non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| The additions include number eight, number 54, and item 906, which was given to you just prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3626)|
| 1:00:39| I have sort of personally slotted that in for 44A, but it doesn't really have a number right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| The additions include number eight, number 54, and resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| Deferrals are 30 and 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3652)|

| 1:01:28| I'll go through those one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Non-consent items currently are six, seven, 36, 39, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3689)|
| 1:01:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Do you have item 20 and 36 on your non-consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| I have 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I do not have 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| If you would like to have 20 pulled, I can add that to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| You did tell me that before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Add number 20 to the non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Any other items or amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Seeing none, I'll entertain a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| Motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=3747)|

| 1:07:08| It's my understanding that it is partly due to lost revenue for the City and that we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| be using it even five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4036)|

| 1:08:22| Just to also understand, is there a precedence that we've used the same building for other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| Have they always charged us or is this unique?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| Actually, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| I don't know the answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4114)|

| 1:09:46| This is item number 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Actually, before you read the next item, I'm going to ask everybody to just take a quick break before we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| because I think the next two to three items are going to be lengthy in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| So I'm going to put this meeting into recess for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| So we will return at 625.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4204)|
| 1:10:14| We'll call this meeting back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| We're going to do one bit of housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| This is a clerical error on my part, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| I did not pull 27, 28, and 29 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| All three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| I'll make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Is there any discussion on those three items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| We do have engineering with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Mr. Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Do we need to add it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| No, it would have been on consent, so I'm just pulling it off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| And then moving it forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| So we will address all three of those next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4257)|

| 1:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Move without recommendation, 27, 28, and 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4266)|

| 1:11:18| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4278)|

| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Please read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| On page 7, item number 43, is a resolution establishing a Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4292)|

| 1:11:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4306)|

| 1:11:50| Motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| The motion was to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| I'll open up the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Do you want me to lead off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| So basically we've had discussions over the last couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| and I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I've been watching this committee or the commission for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| and I was trying to be proactive in the sense that this is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| advisory committee for the mayor so that the mayor has experts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| advise him, and not just our current situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| but for future situations going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Also, the way I wrote it with the law director is that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| commission, any of the commissioners that feels like they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| outside expertise is allowed to call on the advisory committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| advise the commission in expertise in those particular fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| So this is for both the commission and for the mayor and for us so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| that we can make as best informed decisions as possible going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| We've had to make the structure of the board as vast as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| to cover as many angles as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| given the amount of different situations that we might see coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| up and going forward through this year and through the next couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| So everything from the mental health to economic standings to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| you know, physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| This year was unpredictable by any stretch of the means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| And, you know, it's possible that we have a tornado or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| economic downturn, another recession or depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| If these situations come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| I want us to have the experts on hand and ready for us as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| commission or for the county mayor to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| what is your expert opinion in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| You know, your job is to look at these kind of things coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| So that was the intent of building this committee to advise us as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| commission and to advise the mayor in particular to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| The way it's structured right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I'm very much open to structuring it a little bit differently and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| a substitute motion if we don't need two economists or we don't need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| biologist or whatever everybody decides or however we come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| But this was just the basic blueprint of what I think it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| generally look like going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| And if we want to tweak it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| we're tweaking it a little bit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| If there's any questions or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| I'm happy to answer any questions coming to me or discussion about it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| So if this resolution passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| how soon would you anticipate the implementation of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| I would assume that we would pass it this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| We would then appoint next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| And they could start advising once they're appointed next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| the mayor or us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| So strictly advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| And right now what it would be is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| if we want to change some of it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| it's the mayor sets the appointments and we confirm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| If there's a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| if we want to select a doctor or a local business person, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| maybe we take two or three of the seats and we select and appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| and maybe the mayor selects and appoints the rest of them if we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| tweak this, but that's the general idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I have no real objection one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| This has so many different disciplines on it that I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4551)|
| 1:16:00| I guess I'm wondering exactly what its purpose really would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Given the fact that we've got emergency management in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| You know, we've got the health department, like it or not, in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| We've got several entities already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| So I guess I just am asking for a little clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| The point was to have as wide a net as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| given the different situations we can run into going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| There's also the possibility that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| if state legislation changes the power to make decisions would go from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| health board to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| At that point, I want them to have as many resources as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| The health board, the advisory board, us as commissioners, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| if there's another situation going forward that comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| I just don't want to be proactive in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| You know, this caught us all off guard and we were reactive, not proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| So I'm trying to be more proactive to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| who knows what's going to come down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| But if it does, not only we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| layers of expertise that we can call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| And the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| they only meet once a year unless it's requested by the mayor or us otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| If it's a state of emergency point like we are in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| they would meet every month and the mayor or us could ask them, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| could you as a board or as a committee look into this for us and give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| your recommendation for a variety of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| So the real elephant in the room, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| is that if we move forward with changes with our board of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| that this may in fact be another entity that would be there to replace it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| in an advisory capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I don't know if replacing is the best word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| but it would be another avenue to advise the mayor in his decision making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| and to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| If the health board doesn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| there are health professionals on here that could give recommendation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| mayor and to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| If the health board is made advisory or removed by either the state or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| commission, I think it's wise to have something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| And if nothing changes, we don't know what this future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| And this sounds like a pretty good mix of people that might be able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| with a growth plan, recovery, and the budgeting process for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4721)|
| 1:18:50| So I don't think you can ever have too many advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| Mr. Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| For some of the new people that are on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| we used to be able to meet in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| and we had the TCSA, the TCCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| that always had these resources that we could go to and call and advise just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| individually since we can't speak to each other publicly unless we sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| But we could always call down there to speak to Charlie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| the guys down there that we normally call for advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| and he sends us where we can get this type of advice to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| So we can help in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| And we're adding another layer of bureaucracy on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| So we have that meeting and this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| and then we've got our other meetings with the state levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And as John Schoonmaker found out when he first got on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| it was a great resource, great resource down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| If you go to the meetings and you talk to other commissioners from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| counties and how they handle things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| So I'm not sure if we need another level or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| I think it's an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| but do we need it when we've got these other resources on a state level that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| has deeper pockets than we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| So anyway, that was just my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I just learned recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| basically this month preparing for our committees on committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| that we already have, besides the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| that we have the Community Health Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| which represents Knox County, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| and the town of Surrogate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Now how would these two play into each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| Would they be conflicting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| How would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| No, this is strictly on an island advisory committee only called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| If we weren't in a state of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| they would just meet once a year just to get everybody to check in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Otherwise, it's strictly local people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| local experts that we can get out in touch when we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| In theory, they could never advise at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| and sit there all year long on a shelf and that be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| They only come into play when the mayor or the commission says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| hey, we have a situation that we're not 100% sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| Let's go bring in our team of experts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| I'm of the opinion that you can go bring in the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| and get their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I'm a person that asks multiple people for their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| Even with the library appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I think I talked to 20, 30 different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| who do you think, who do you think, who do you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| and I went and then made the decision I thought was best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| off all the information that was gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| The same situation, I'm a CEO, I take a CEO's approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| I want as much information as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| and go talk to as many experts as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| If I've got a leaky faucet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| I want to go get estimates from three plumbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| I don't go ask the electrician and the carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| I want to go find the plumber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| and have them answer the question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Would the other two governmental entities have any kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Sorry, would the other two governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| like the town of Farragut and the city be involved at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| The way that I've written it right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| is that they're not involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| It's strictly to advise the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| and to advise the commission on an as-needed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| If they're not needed, then they don't ever advise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| but if they are needed, at least they're advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| If we want to look at expanding that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| if the city or the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| would like to have access to the advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I'm sure the advisory committee would be open to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| and we can always go back and change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| at a later point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| so they have access to that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| That's more than reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| I'm not seeing any other lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| so I'm going to weigh in on this for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| before I go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker for a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I'm a big believer that bigger government isn't better government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| and when I was doing my research on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| this is what I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| In Knox County, we have an emergency management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| we have a food policy council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=4994)|

| 1:23:20| I don't know what the name of that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| but it was formed with the highest-level leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| in all of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| We have state-level resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5007)|

| 1:23:31| We have an All for Knox committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| that focuses on substance abuse and mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| with a business council, a health council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| and a government leadership council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| We have a joint economic and community development board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| through the Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| We have the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| which has an economic development council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5025)|

| 1:24:14| that are not related to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| They also do a community health assessment every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And we have a board of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| which has 7 to 10 members that have medical degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5060)|

| 1:24:25| We have three members who are tapped directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| into the public at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| the business community and the education sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| And then we have the community health council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| which I verified that they are codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| in Knox County Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| They are the advisory board for appointed and elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| They create the community health improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| And specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| they do a lot of what is written in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| They support and steer a health improvement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| in Knox County, including the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5095)|

| 1:25:12| for improving health in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| city of Knoxville, and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5113)|

| 1:25:17| for the local public health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| and all of those entities in the form of an action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| They communicate assessment results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| and action plans to community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| the public, the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| They act as a forum for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| and coordination of community-wide efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| to improve health outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| and local public health system functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| And they act as an advisory body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| to elected and appointed officials in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| city of Knoxville, and the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| in matters of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| I also verified that in at least the last few recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| only one commissioner has ever attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| a county health council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| And so I ask you, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| why isn't adding this other advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| bigger government and not better government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Sorry, repeat the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Why is adding a new board on top of everything I just read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| better government and not just bigger government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| This is, again, just to advise the mayor and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| So I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| trying to make it as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| I'm hitting my mute button over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| As the CEO, I want to pick the best experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| to put around me to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| All I'm doing is try to give another CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| which the mayor is, is the executor of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| the ability to pick the best experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| that he wants to put around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| And for us to be able to access those experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| in making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Have you considered trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| with the community health council that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| that's already in place to amend the membership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Or they do exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| They may have a different makeup on their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| I think you're focusing on health a little too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| This is bigger than just health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| and this isn't just the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| This is economic, mental, everything encompassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Commissioner Lundy, you haven't weighed in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| I'm appreciating everyone's questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| but I wonder if it's okay we can ask Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| how she feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| So I listened to you talk about having the experts available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| and the mayor has chosen his cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| He has experts available in health, finance, development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| and all of those things in his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| And my department alone has relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| with the community health council, the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| We have an academic health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| which has an official relationship with UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| allowing us access to experts at UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| for advice or conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| So I think the mayor does have expertise available to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| to provide him with advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| and you all have expertise available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| to provide you with advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| and very few of you have reached out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| during the pandemic or my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Some of you have and some of you haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| but my staff is always available to provide their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| that Commissioner Jay just read about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| to any of you at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| and to the town of Farragut and to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So we have the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| As I stated in my letter, this seems duplicative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| of what we already have available in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| to advise you and the mayor on lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Commissioner, do you wish to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Okay. Commissioner Schoonmaker is next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| and then Commissioner Smith, did you want your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| No. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| So during a non-emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| then the mayor would call this body to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| for a committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| and then during a major event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| does he make the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| that this is a declared emergency then to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| The way I think I had it written was in a state of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| they would meet once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| and if there was any direction given by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| they would work on a direction given by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Otherwise, they would sit idle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| unless called upon by the mayor to tackle a certain issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| and to give advice on a certain issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Okay, but I guess what I'm getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| would the mayor then declare the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| Because sometimes the governor would declare an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| but that's West Tennessee, Middle Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| If the mayor declares an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| or if it involves Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| then the mayor would say, this is what I need help on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| And there might be an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| and he doesn't need advice on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and they don't give advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| It's simply at the call of the commissioner or the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| to give advice on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| And then I guess maybe, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| maybe Dr. Buchanan maybe can answer this or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| but since March 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| how many times has the Community Health Council met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Actually, the Community Health Council has not been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| They've been kind of on a hiatus since March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| because we've been utilizing the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| and if you recall, we did put together a reopening task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| So they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| They just, nobody's asked them to weigh in on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| so they haven't met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| So who would normally ask them to weigh in on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| Anybody could ask them to weigh in on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| on whatever thing, something related to health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| They're a relatively new body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| and one of their primary functions has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| to create our Community Health Improvement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| which they were on the verge of doing that when COVID hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| and so we kind of sidelined that and we've been focusing on COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| So it's a reasonable question, but they haven't met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| because their big focus has been the Community Health Improvement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| which we put on hold for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| But if Commissioner Ward's group was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| they would be actually in place ready to advise the Mayor and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| If the Mayor and Commission wanted to ask the Community Health Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| to convene more often, I'm sure they would entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| It's just not been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Smith will be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| Just a question, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Is this something that the Mayor has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| or expressed a need to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| I haven't been talking to him directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| I just said, is this something that would interest you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| And he said, yes, it's something I'd be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| We haven't had a discussion past that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| Just beyond a casual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| Yeah, it was, hey, I'm thinking about doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| and he said, I like that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| and then that was the end of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| Community Health Council, is that what it's called, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| Their sole mission is to do a five-year health plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| It's part of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| What is the rest of their mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| As it states in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| they are there to advise elected and appointed officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| and leaders on matters related to health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| But not economics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Public health does encompass some economics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| but no, not specifically economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Again, you all make the decision you want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I think we have a lot of resources available in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| If you want to talk, talk, but I can't do this and listen over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| I'm sorry, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Is there another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| No, I didn't really hear the finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I got distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Okay, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Yes, their main focus is health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| but if you back up and look at public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| public health does encompass not just physical health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| but emotional, economic well-being as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| So those are all possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| certainly resources that could be tapped into if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Okay, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Mr. Chairman, you may know the answer to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| or Commissioner Smith is looking at the ordinance, or maybe Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| What is the specific makeup of the Community Health Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| Is it prescribed, and how many members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| It is prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Their membership is limited to 21 people total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| You have an appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Your current employee is Lara Fleming with the Trust Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| City Council, Alderman, all have appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| as well as the County Mayor, the City Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| and the Town of Farragut Mayor all have appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| I sit on it because of my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| so I have a permanent position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| The city has a representation, well, I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| The city has representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| And then there are community volunteers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| So the Executive Committee of the Board chooses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| or asks people to participate on the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| As we look at the matrix or the makeup of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| and look at what gaps we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| like we don't have somebody representing small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| we don't have somebody representing the real estate industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| So we try to fill those gaps with folks that have some expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and knowledge that aren't particularly actually health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| because we need all those points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Commissioner Skinmaker, and then I'll be back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| I never really gave up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| He never gave up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| I'm sorry. I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Sorry. Commissioner Smith, go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| No, go ahead, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I'd like the Law Director to read for the members of the public here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| the four functions of the Community Health Council into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| State Law 68-2802 creates the Health Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| and says there are four powers that that committee has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Number one, they are to be informed concerning the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| and programs of the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Number two, they are to assist in informing residents of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| and services provided by the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Number three, they are to advise a health director of community health needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| Number four, they are to advise a health director, county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| and county commissions of potential solutions to problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| in the delivery of health services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| and to recommend such policies designed to improve the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| of the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| When I drafted this at the request of Commissioner Ward, I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| There was no intertwining between, as I saw it, what I drafted at his request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| and what this state law says about the Health Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| So in simple terms, can you repeat the TCA code, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| 68-2802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| So these are two separate entities that we're talking about here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| That's my opinion, but it's a policy decision by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| I'm not going to get into your policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| I just read what the Health Council state law said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| Director Booth, so if that council is separate than the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| and my understanding of Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| and I think everybody's getting in the weeds, he's talking about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| He's playing chess right now, not checkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| and everybody don't see that he's talking about stuff that could impact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| in different directions for future use, not just health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| And I applaud him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| But, Director Booth, is there any way that we could, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| call an emergency session of that council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Because obviously Olive Commission doesn't agree with everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| And, two, Commissioner Ward, would you be open to have a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| from that council as well on your resolution to give input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| The question was about calling a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| Yes, like an emergency session from that council that you were speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| That council could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| I don't know how it functions, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| I don't know who's the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| And I guess the chairman could call one but can't have any more powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| than what's been granted by state law that I just read to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| So we have a council that's not met since March, and we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| Is there a member of the law director's office that advises that council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Mr. Morton has advised them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| I was talking to Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I didn't ask for your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| I don't know that they've had any advice because there's three bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| There's Farragut, the City of Knoxville, and they all have their own minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| And then there's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| So there's three separate minds in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| So we would have to contact the City of Knoxville and Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| to be able to have them meet as well as Dr. Buchanan and call a session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| I don't even know what the makeup is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Dr. Buchanan, I'll ask the question since you were so rudely cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Can you tell us who from the law department has been advising this council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| Point of order, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| I don't know what the rub was, but I don't think whenever I had the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| and I was talking to Director Booth, I didn't cut anybody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| I was having a conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| If you want Mr. Morton to be here at the next meeting to talk in any way about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| I will have him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| Dr. Buchanan, Myers Morton is who you said has been advising this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| He has in the past advised this group when we established the health council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| He advised us about operationally open meetings and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| And I guess I have a question, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| what you read in TCA was about a health advisory committee as opposed to a health council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| They're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| They're established the same as municipalities and the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I thought somebody asked if they were separate, and you said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| I must have misheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| The health council was created by county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| The health advisory committee seems different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| It took three bodies to put that together, the city, Farragut, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Three bodies passing three separate resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Under the state law which provides for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6038)|

| 1:40:43| We're trying to combine three different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| The Board of Health is created by this body, by ordinance and state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| and then by ordinance by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| The health council was created by three bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| And what we're talking about with Mr. Ward, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| is an entity that solely advises Knox County commissioners and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6061)|
| 1:41:09| Many of those things that have been listed are responsible to many entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| not just Knox County commission or the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| And, again, none of them seem to take into the whole what we're learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6079)|
| 1:41:26| and experiencing from COVID-19 is that health goes into many different areas of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| not just your physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| And I think this board is pretty well-rounded to give us advice on all things of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6095)|
| 1:41:45| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| Currently the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| with a first by Commissioner Ward and a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6117)|

| 1:42:00| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| I would like to vote nay, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| Next item, please, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| This is a resolution that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| It's Resolution R-20-10-906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| You were given a handout prior to the meeting on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6139)|

| 1:42:29| in the amount not to exceed $60,000, $5,000 per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| plus out-of-pocket expenses to provide government relations services with the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6153)|

| 1:42:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6171)|

| 1:42:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| This was added at the last minute, but I would like to point out to all my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| that this is an amount under the required amount for us to even approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| and the Mayor and the Finance Department are being very transparent by bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6189)|
| 1:43:19| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| This is a new group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| I understand we used another group prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| This is a lobbying contract, and I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| I'm totally good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| I absolutely see the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I think Chris can answer, but I think we moved to this group last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| You can state your name and department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Chris Cocknell with the Department of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| It's the same group that we are currently using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| Their contract expires basically in October, so it's time for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| What was the amount of their contract last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| It has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| It has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| We just wanted to bring it for transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I apologize for the late add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| We meant to get it last week, and I was occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6250)|

| 1:44:14| Commissioner Daley, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| It was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| There's a motion to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6264)|

| 1:44:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| On page 8, this is item number 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 38, Article 2, Division 1, Section 38-33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6280)|

| 1:44:48| and to add certain requirements to the meanings of the Knox County Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| Health in times of declared emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Ordinance No. 0-96-3-102, adopted April 22, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6296)|
| 1:45:03| And this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| First by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| Do you want me to lead off again with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| This is basically just a transparency thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| I've heard from thousands of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| a few here in the room even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| that they would like to speak to the health board because the health board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| passing restrictions on their civil liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| So basically it doesn't take any power away from the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| It's solely as the commission meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| the health board will meet in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I think at the next meeting I will offer a substitute motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| I fully believe that if you are in a position where you make policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| it is your duty and obligation to listen to the public for which you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| making those policies for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| So I'll be supporting that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| I don't think I can support the part where we dictate how they have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| meetings, whether they're Zoom or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| especially when the governor has given that authority to the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| I'm open to making a substitute motion tonight on that then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| if you want me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I feel similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| I did have one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| just related to Commissioner Smith's comment for our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| If the governor has an executive order that permits people to operate in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| way electronically, would this body, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| would we be able to say how to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| I mean, it seems like contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| No, it's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| Executive order 60 talks about the ability to use Zoom meetings or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| whatever, and a partial body can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| But it specifically states only for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| its agencies, and its subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| which are the counties of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| It says nothing about local municipalities or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| So from that aspect, from that aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| executive order 60 doesn't apply down below this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| This body can do it, but under executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| if you read it very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| it does not provide for anything other than the state agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| the legislature, the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| and the subdivisions of the state of which county commissions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Is the Board of Health, since it is codified by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| not part of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| It's not an extension of Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| If you read it, it says subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| It doesn't say these agencies and sub-agencies of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| Now, in all fairness, let me point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| like everything else that's going on in this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| if you look at the state law that provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| it says that meetings have to be carried on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| public meetings of any governmental body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| A governmental body is defined as anything that's making policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| or recommending policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| So it's, for instance, a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Your committees advise this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| That's open for public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| So that word governing body is in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| but the governor didn't use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| The governor didn't put it in there like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Whether it's an oversight or what, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| You can do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| You can do what you want or tell that body to do what it wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| but I'm just telling you that Executive Order 60 does not provide for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| subcommittees and other boards under a county body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| But do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| I'm just telling you what the executive order says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| No, I guess my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| So it's a policy issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| I was just trying to get some clarification because for the whole summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| we've been told that the Board of Health is a government body that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| policy changes that is part of Knox County and codified by our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| I haven't told you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| The law department for Knox County has opined as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| We have opined that that body is not responsive to any elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| and can do whatever the heck it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| That's what I have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| If that's the case, then how can we pass an ordinance in our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| code telling it what it can and can't do if it can do anything it wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| on its own and doesn't answer to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| No, there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| You're not delineating between the policy and the power they have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| This doesn't touch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| This goes to how they conduct their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| So you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Just like this board can tell any committee it's got or any other board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| how to conduct its meetings, and that's all this is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| And the main thing in this was the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| That was the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| So we're telling them a procedural thing but not a substantive thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| and there's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| First, I want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6643)|
| 1:50:49| The emergency powers issued by the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| does it really give the Board of Health any more power than they normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| have under the current ordinance that we have and the state statute that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| They're limited by what the statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| So my question is, why would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| First of all, we haven't asked the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| we haven't asked BZA or any of these other people to meet in person just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| because we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Whatever the statute says, it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I think people should be allowed to have their meetings the way they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| comfortable having them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| So it's not a matter of law for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| It's a matter of courtesy and respect for a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| But I don't see why we're doing this just in the case of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| whenever this board has this power at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| And I would like this just to simply, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| state that they will have public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| whether it's Zoom in person at every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| because they have the ability to make public policy at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| given the state of emergency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| So I don't know why we're limiting this public input to just times when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| we're in a state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| And, again, would it be a federally declared emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| Would it be a state declared emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Would it be a local declared emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| I don't know why we just don't take the word emergency out of it and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| that if you're going to be a body that makes public policy in normal days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| and in tough days, you have to listen to the public you're setting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| policy for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| I think I've got my question pretty much answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| Commissioner Hills, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| If I could just take a moment of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| Could you speak into the mic more, sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| If I could just take a moment of privilege in this to a slight diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| How long are we going to all dance around what it is that all these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| are sitting here wanting us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6795)|
| 1:53:27| Having said that, I didn't say I necessarily agreed or disagreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| Please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| I just really believe the time has come for this body to hit this head on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6817)|
| 1:53:45| We're either going to do this or we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| And I know we are under a motion and a second right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| but I would appreciate perhaps if we could put this on the end of this work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6834)|
| 1:54:02| Would you like to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| No, I would not like to make a substitute motion because I'm not addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| specifically this resolution that is on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| We'll finish this bit of business and then I will propose an addition to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| which I think can be done with two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| It does, but if it's an ordinance change, it would require public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| and you couldn't add an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| a two-thirds vote without public notice of that ordinance change, I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| If there's a substantive change between the first reading and the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| then what substantive change is is for you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| I think you're talking about something completely different than this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I am. I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| However, Mr. Law Directors, is there any reason that I cannot add it as a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| You can do whatever this board allows you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| You could ask for an additional discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| but you would not be able to add an ordinance change on the spot without public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| Commissioner Ward, the way I see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| you're going to draw in times of declared emergency on item C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| and then we're going to drop one meeting shall be in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| I want to do a substitute motion and just have it straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| As the county commission, as public forum, the health board will have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6940)|
| 1:55:48| So get rid of the state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| Get rid of the meeting in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Just the people need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| So I want them to be heard just like at commission they're heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| So we'll get rid of number one and the time of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| And we'll still have public forum and provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| and they shall not dimish the statutory powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Two, three, and four would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| Just get rid of number one, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Very good, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| So we'll have that cleared up by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| I have Commissioner Busler talking about the current motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| before we go to any substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| And I saw Beeler as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| So what we've got right now is a motion and a second to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7004)|
| 1:56:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| We have to address that first before we make any substitute motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| You could add a substitute motion, and you would take care of that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| and then you would go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| So I'm going to make a substitute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Mr. Busler, you've concluded in your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Just want to make sure I get everybody on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Commissioner Ward, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| So I want to make a substitute motion where everything is the same minus number one on the current resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7040)|
| 1:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| One second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| And eliminate emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Number one, the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| So the motion is to adopt the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| The substitute motion is to adopt the current ordinance by removing the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| in times of a declared emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| So it would start with the County Board of Health shall meet low, less than bi-monthly with the following requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Has it been added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| And then you would keep number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| You would remove number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| You would keep number two as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| You would keep number three as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| And you would keep number four as written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Is that clear to everybody what the substitute motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| Can we pause for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| We can have a discussion if there's a second, but we do not have a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| Second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Now we can have discussion on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Commissioner Buslack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Do you have a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| It is on your online agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| We will take a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| It's on number 45 on your online agenda, if everybody wants to take a minute to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| I'm getting it right on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| I want to repeat the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| The substitute motion is to adopt ordinance O-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| It is to move forward with no recommendation, not to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| It is to move forward with no recommendation, ordinance O-20-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| We have a vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| This is the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| But the substitute is to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| We haven't voted on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| I'm repeating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Yeah, but you can't move it with no recommendation until we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| The substitute motion is to move forward with the following changes, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| With no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| You can't pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| No, with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| So, just to repeat, the substitute motion is to move forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| ordinance number 0-20-10-101 with the following changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7168)|
| 1:59:37| Item number C, or item C would have struck from it in times of declared emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7177)|
| 1:59:46| and it would start with the county board of health shall meet no less than bimonthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| with the following requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Item number 1 will be removed entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Items 2, 3, and 4 will stay and it's as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| This is a substitute motion by Commissioner Ward and a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| You have the floor, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7212)|
| 2:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| The first question I have is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| He'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| He's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7235)|
| 2:00:53| Sir, number 2 says meetings shall allow a public forum in the same manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| as afforded by citizens of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| Number 3 says during public forum residents shall be allowed no less than three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| nor more than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| Is that contradictory if it doesn't match our rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| Well, I put the three in there because I think at one meeting when the chairman reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| when we were going seven hours, suggested and got people down to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| That's why I stuck that in there, but you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| The rule is five, so you might want to strike that one out, but that's your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| I just think if we're going to say it has to match our rules, it has to match our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| Let's strike that out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| The second question is in times of declared emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| the county board of health shall meet no less than bimonthly twice a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| with the following requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7322)|
| 2:02:10| I don't know if I have a problem with that or not, but right now we're in emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| and they've decided to go to monthly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| They're on bimonthly right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| One every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| I'd kind of like everybody else's input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker, and then I'll go to Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| and then I have a question myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| If you strike out the declared emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| then we're asking this citizen body to meet 24 times a year when there is no emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| I don't think we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Well, it actually says on that line, during a declared emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| But they're saying strike that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| In the substitute motion, that is stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| So that means emergency or non-emergency, they meet 24 times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| I think what we were talking about striking out before was whereas the exercise of powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| in times of declared emergency impact the physical and economic, you could strike that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| I think you could still say that down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| But, again, I don't dictate, don't like dictating when people meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| and how they meet when they're a separate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| That's kind of why I wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| I'm sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| No, that was my point too, that if there's not an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| why would they want to meet 24 times a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| That's what I was going to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| Twice a month in a non-emergency is just way too many times to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| You know, we could say monthly, and that would have been left in, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| if we would just drop in times of declared emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So I would change that bi-monthly to monthly, Mr. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| And then a lot of times, if there's nothing to meet about, they'll send out and cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| You know, this meeting's been canceled, and they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| So would you consider what I would suggest is I know we're on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7454)|
| 2:04:24| but probably what would have been more clear is just went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| and rescinded your first motion and then restated motion all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| but we're still on the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| So now we may have to do a third, a second, you know, finish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| to drop that only to monthly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| I'll go with the monthly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| I wouldn't go bi-monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| Mr. Chairman, can I ask for a point of clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Commissioner Daley, are you satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| I'm going to move on after this point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Yes, this is a question for both you and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| I guess the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| in our ordinance doesn't address how often this board is supposed to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| and what do your bylaws and rules of the Board of Health say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| Now you're really testing my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| I can look at them, but I think that it says we meet quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| unless otherwise needed or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| So our standing meeting is quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| I think that's a better thing to match up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| If I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Mr. Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| That's generally what we have for all of our, like, the Ethics Committee and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| They meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| A lot of these committees meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Unless there's nothing there, then the chairman says there's nothing happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| so we just don't have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| So I think that Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| that probably reflects what's generally the policy in Knox County anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| I just wanted to say that I would be, I think I'm the second on the substitute motion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| I would be fine with that change if the maker of the motion is fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| Just for that language to reflect however the board currently meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| no less than however they currently do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Before, Mr. Buch, your light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| Before we go back, which I think you're getting ready to sort of re-pash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| I just would like to chime in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| I think we ought to need to take a step back for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| We're all sitting here tweaking and writing and making up language in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| that is changing the law of Knox County in real time on a different body that we don't manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7603)|
| 2:06:53| And that the language isn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| And I just, I think that if it's clear that you ought to go back and write it in a way that's clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| but to change it on the fly in the middle of an ordinance on a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| it's just, it's really not great government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| And we're stripping away more and more and more and more to a point where it's going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| And I would say that if I looked at the Board of Health rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| which are essentially the same as our rules, and I've done, just like this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| the chairman has a ton of discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| And the chairman could go, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| but we're going to have public forum and we're going to do it for 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| And we're going to have four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| I mean, they can change how they operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| So this, again, gets down to sort of nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| And it might suggest we tell them something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| but not a single person from this commission that I'm aware of has sent a letter to the Board of Health chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| asking for public forum, has gone and asked for a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| for lobbied for the public to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| And instead of going to them and asking to adapt and to change who they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| and to welcome more voices in the room, we're not even going to go talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| We're just going to go, we could all vote on something that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| we as the county commission think that you ought to hear from all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| and send a letter on behalf of commission saying we ought to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| We ought to really urge you to go do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| We ought to put all of our weight behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| But we're sort of tinkering around with the nuts and bolts of our law in real time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| and I just think it's not the best way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| We're constantly trying to adapt and adjust things instead of going and trying to reform what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| And I think Commissioner Hill is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| This is like six end arounds to get to the one thing that nobody will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| So quit end around and quit tinkering with all the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| Pull all this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Go put your ordinance down that says we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| And then vote it up or down and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| But we're confusing the public more than anybody has ever done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| and we're doing it in a way that's just not good government in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| I'll be quiet and pass my time over to Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| Commissioner Ward, Smith, and Daly, and I don't know what order you were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| but I think Commissioner Ward, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| This is the working session, isn't it, where we're supposed to work this stuff out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| This is when we can all meet and talk and discuss this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| It is, but an ordinance is literally you do a first and second reading because it's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| It's not just a resolution where we kind of say, hey, here's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| It's changing the law of our government, and you don't usually do that in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| When else are we able to all meet like this and discuss it, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| This is the time to discuss it before we even put it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| We don't even know if we want to put this forward yet because none of us has taken a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| We're all trying to work through this in real time because this is the time we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| to try to make this the best from all the representatives of all the people of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| So that's what I feel like we're all trying to do here is try to figure out what the best way to craft this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| to make sure it's the most fair and the best thing for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| So we currently have a substitute motion on the table, and we have two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| Would you pass right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Yeah, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| We've never had a maker of a motion do a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| So, Mr. Law Director, is that under Robert's rule of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| Should he withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| I thought he should withdraw his motion, then made a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| Are you asking can he substitute his own motion for a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Yeah, I guess technically you're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| But he's got to have a right to come in and, as he said, we're here to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| We can play the games with that, but let's get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| That's what I think everybody up here is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| So technically I guess you've got to withdraw that one and resubmit a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| I think to make it all clear, we don't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| If we withdraw the second substitute motion, you withdraw your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| then make a new motion of what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| So in that case, if that's correct, we would have no substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| because that was not legal according to Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| and you would have a new motion to move forward with the following changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| and you would outline those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Is that what you wish to do, Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Commissioner Smith has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| The original motion on the floor is to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| We would need to withdraw that because if he makes another motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| that's technically just another substitute motion while that motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Now, you could move forward without recommendation with no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| and make those changes before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| If those changes are deemed substantive, you'd have to start all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| but if they're not deemed substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| It couldn't be deemed substantive because it's a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| So you could literally just move forward without recommendation, adjust your language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| make sure everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| Have this language come back the way that we've discussed if we can get it written down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| And I think everybody's in agreement that the only thing we want to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| is that they must have public forum in the same form that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| Everybody's in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Now, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| This is how legislation works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| It doesn't work behind doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| We have things in public that we discuss, and we're trying to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| And, you know, to Commissioner Hill's point, yes, we may get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| but in the meantime, I think some people are trying to make provisions for the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7968)|
| 2:12:58| whether it is setting up another advisory board in case it goes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| and turns into an advisory-only position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| and also setting up that if it does go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| they at least have to listen to the public that they're making policy for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| And this is how this is supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| This is an ordinance on first reading at a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| This is not we've got through first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| and we're sitting here trying to get this through next month's voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| This is the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| So going back, Commissioner Ward, if I'm stating it correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| what would you like to do, Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| Well, the substitute motion is not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| It's not legal because you're the motioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| So where are we currently at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| I can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| Not me, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| So right now we have an original motion on the floor from Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| and a second from Commissioner Beeler to move forward without recommendation, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8041)|
| 2:14:10| Is that what you'd like to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Yeah, that's the original one I made, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| I'll have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| With the understanding that it will be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| language will be corrected by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| If that language is corrected, please send it back out in new form to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| There is a motion on the floor with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| We move forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| That is item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| Item number 46 is consideration of the acceptance of New County Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| A Lake Lane located off Duncan Road, Commission District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8102)|
| 2:15:10| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Where am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| My motion to approve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| Move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| I guess you could approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Is a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Can you approve it on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| We can put it on consent for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| You can approve it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Why were they pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| I thought this was on last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| I think it's 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| No, it's just an acceptance of a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Are we supposed to be on item 47 or 46?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| We're on item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| You can move to approve if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Seconded by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| First by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8154)|

| 2:17:38| Item number 52 is discussion item regarding the Tennessee Governor Bill Lee's executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8258)|
| 2:17:45| order number 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I was wanting to discuss this last month but didn't do it because as I was reading through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| this recommendation, item number 1, it says on this first item, it says as reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| measure to protect the safety and welfare of Tennessee while ensuring that government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| business may continue in a manner that is open and accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| And it has some more reading here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| Then you get down to item 4 in that first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| Nothing in paragraph A1 prohibits some members of government from participating in meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8296)|
| 2:18:23| of government body in the same location while others may participate at another governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8303)|
| 2:18:30| body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| And what this is is Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| This act is going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| And when it goes away, all meetings from what I understand in our charter will be held like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8317)|
| 2:18:44| they were in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| And we've been discussing some people want to meet on Zoom and some people don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| to Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| But if the governor does not extend this and says we're going back the way it is, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8333)|
| 2:19:00| has to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| So all meetings will be open and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| And I hope nobody in this body here sees that this is an opportunity to have the state give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8348)|
| 2:19:19| us a regulation where we could have hybrid meetings in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| Because if we do, I've heard people say, ask some other state reps to give Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8363)|
| 2:19:31| an exemption to where we could operate both hybrid and full meetings like we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8371)|
| 2:19:41| right now, where we can have it because of sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| And we can't do that by charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| And I just wanted to bring that up, that once it's over with, go back the way we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| And what we're doing right now is saying, now we have the people that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| get these committees up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| They're going to have to meet just like we do because our charter says so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| So I just wanted to bring that up as a discussion to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| And we will look that up in the Rules Committee too when we have that at our meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8410)|
| 2:20:16| I can address the second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| I'm actually somebody who, one, it may be the person you're referring to, has talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| to a state legislator about having the ability to have a hybrid approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| I brought that up well before COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Actually, long ago when Commissioner Daley was laid up for at least three different meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| and his constituents were not represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| And I have asked for them to look at legislation that would allow us under a medical emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8437)|
| 2:20:44| to have somebody have the ability, have a commissioner have the ability to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| like Commissioner Beeler did, virtually, where he was able to represent his constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| in a productive and an open manner with one member or, you know, in a remote way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| I think the Board of Health, the Board of Education has an ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| I think other governing bodies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| And so I have asked to look into legislation that would allow us that for a medical emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| so that we didn't have any opportunity to have somebody not represented in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| That is certainly still in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| But I would hope that we could do something that would make an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| I've had 13 surgeries in 13 years putting me back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| There is going to be a time where I'm going to have another surgery to put me back together even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| And I would love to not, you know, miss out on a meeting because of something that just wasn't on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| I wanted to ask the law director, is it in our charter that our meetings have to be in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8498)|
| 2:21:50| They're under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| So if the state did change the law, then we could have that possibility of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| we'd run into the slippery slope of what's a medical emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| But I've seen the school board do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| The school board has a specific statute that says one, but no more than one person can attend an open meeting by electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8529)|
| 2:22:20| That's a special statute for school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| I just want clarification if it's the statute or the charter that says we don't have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| Commissioner Bussle, would you like to come back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| Well, I'm probably the oldest one here, on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| and probably the most likely to have some sort of physical ailment or something come on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| But I'm going into my seventh and my eighth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| I've got 22 months left on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| I've missed one meeting in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1477-201019?start=8572)|
