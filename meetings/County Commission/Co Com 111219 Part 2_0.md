| 0:07:33| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Ms. Preslee, you have two lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| How many total acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| 2.5, 2.6, 2.51 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| But there's actually two separate lots now, or this is one big piece now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| It's two separate lots. The back one has one house on it, and the front one has one house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| And I want to sell the front house, but I don't want to sell the whole acre and a half with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| So in order to sell just the house and part of the land, I have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| because the lot will be too small for it to be zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| How big is this lot going to be with the house that you're selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| I'm not real sure I have all that in front of me. The papers are upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| While you're looking, is this house connected to the sewer now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| You said it's on stamped land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| The one that I'm selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| It is connected to the sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| Buzz, you know how much is in this piece that we're talking about cutting off here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| Well, currently, based upon the property records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| there's roughly 1.28 acres on the front lot and 1.23 acres on the back lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| It sounds like that she's going to do some reconfiguration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| And what I'm hearing her say is it's enough to put, if it stays agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| it may put the front lot less than one acre, the one acre minimum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| If I'm hearing what she's trying to do, it would put that front lot less than one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| and she couldn't sell it based on that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| Wouldn't it be to your advantage to sell the whole lot with the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| Well, the way it's divided right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| the right-of-way that goes to the back piece of property is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| So I can't really sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Well, there's easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| I mean, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| I have one of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Well, I mean, I don't want to sell that much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| I want to keep that connected to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| We do have some folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Those who are in opposition, would you like to come forward and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| And if you would give us your name and address of the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| My name is Gene Scrivener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I live at 7825 Camberley Drive for the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| The more I get involved with this, the less or the more confused I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| Can Mrs. Presley petition to rezone the house and the lot when she's actually not the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=649)|
| 0:11:01| As of November the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| the tax assessor's office told me that the owner was a gentleman named Luther Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:14| Does she know Luther Henley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Her name is not on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| She's not the owner of the property, according to the tax assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| The application that we have is dated August 19th, so at that time she may have been the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| In other words, it's already sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Mrs. Presley, would you like to come down and perhaps shed some light on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| Luke Henley is my grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| and he was here with me when I filed everything up at the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| and they said that was fine as long as he was there and signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| Is that proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| We just want to make sure everything is done properly, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| A zoning application can be submitted by a property owner or an agent acting on behalf of a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:23| So, Mrs. Presley, you would say that you were acting on behalf of your grandfather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I own the back and he owns the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| One other conflict that I have is at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| the property was described essentially as one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| Now, as I understand it, when Mrs. Presley was divorced, they subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| and there's two pieces of property, one on the backside of the lot and the one where the house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| But the MPC commissioner, the only question that they had during the discussion period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| one of the commissioners spoke up and said, is this one piece of property or two pieces of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| The chairman of the MPC said right off the bat, this is one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| Mr. Donaldson called me last week and told me that we were talking about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| and he said it's two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| The MPC didn't talk about two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Sir, may I ask, what is the bottom line with your opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Why are you opposed to her rezoning this and selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| We're afraid it's going to be a trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| The MPC staff did not do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Number one, they said there would be no traffic impact on Stamps Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| Stamps Lane is about two miles long from Camberley Drive to old Clinton Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| There's two blind hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| There's mailboxes on the side of the road, two cars meeting each other, and a mailbox cannot pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| So, you know, they obviously didn't do their homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and also Mrs. Presley operated a very successful child care center there out of the basement of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:42| and the licensing bureau would not renew her license because they said Stamps Lane was too narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| and too dangerous for a child care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| But the Metropolitan Planning Commission says no impact on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| Buzz, just a couple more questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Are you concerned this could become a trailer park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| And if it does become a trailer park, if you're only talking about an acre or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| how many trailers or manufactured homes could you put on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Well, that's kind of an open-ended answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| It depends on how many units they want to try to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| You know, you have an extreme number based on gross density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| but you have to factor in any kind of access easement that may be needed to the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| You take that access easement out of your the number of lots that you're actually going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| So it, you know, right to the west of the property, you have about four lots that range in size from roughly a third of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:57| to a little over a quarter of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| With the size of this property, I suspect you maybe could get two more lots reasonably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| It's hard in this particular situation because it's based on minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| It's hard to, and the fact you have to have an access easement to make sure all lots have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| it's kind of difficult to come up with any kind of definitive number, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| if that is what, you know, she eventually or is the eventual outcome of this at some point down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| As Mark has stated and I have stated, you know, that would have to come back to MPC for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| Right now, with only the zoning, all she can do, all that can happen is two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| But to add to that, you have to go through another process to be able to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Ms. Presley, are you going to turn this into a trailer park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I mean, would you come to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I want to get this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| No, I have no plans to put a trailer park on Stamps Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Okay. Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Buzz and Mark answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| My question was about before this would become a trailer park, what the process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| And they answered that, that it would have to come back before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So that alleviates my concerns in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| I would hate to make a decision based on what might happen with a future owner or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| If it was unrestricted, that might be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| But if it has to come back before MPC, before anything like that would happen, that alleviates some of my concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I just want to reiterate, Buzz, and make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| On the map, we're looking at 23 and 23.01, and she's going to rezone all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| But if she adds a single dwelling, she has to come before MPC on either lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| That's what I asked you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| She has a single dwelling on each lot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| If she were to subdivide the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| To put a house up, she'd have to subdivide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Put another house on a lot, she would need to subdivide the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| That would have to be approved either by Planning Commission staff if it falls within the category of an administrative plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| or by the Planning Commission if there are a greater number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Ms. Presley, you made a comment about closing the daycare, and you had some sort of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Did you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| That is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| I closed the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I moved my family daycare out of my house, and I opened up a center licensed for 80 kids in the Food City Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| at the bottom of the hill, and I willingly closed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I kept my license in good standing for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| But after I'd had the daycare for three years, I came down here and closed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Was the daycare in this house that you're wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| The house that I'm selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| About seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| You know, you all talk about traffic and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| It's going to add more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| I mean, to me, she just took traffic off the road for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| When she moved the daycare from there, moved it somewhere else, that helped the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Another thing, when you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| People who use the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Talk to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| People who use Stamps Lane regularly like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Stamps Lane is just what it says it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| It's a narrow country lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| It's about one traffic lane and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| Two cars have to almost come to a stop to slow down to get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| And if there's a mailbox there, one of them has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I know exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| But what I'm just trying to redirect to you is she helped the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| She took a business off of there, and now there's less traffic on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| There's a house there, and that's all that's going to be there as far as the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| It's not the house there that bothers us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| It's what she does with the property, what she intends to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Before the MPC, the reason she wanted to sell the property, they asked her three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:11| and they got the same answer three times in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| She wanted a smaller yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| She doesn't even live in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| She has both properties up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| And one of the neighbors there called her about buying the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and she said she'd get back with them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| But she never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| So we believe she already has a buyer contingent upon getting this property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:39| And I hope she does have a buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| But she's just told you your main concern is she's not going to put a trailer park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| What happens if she does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| She sells the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| MPC is not going to approve a trailer park, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| And if you don't like what she's going to do with the land, you guys need to buy the land from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| If you want to control the land, you just need to buy it from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Well, the guy called her about buying the property, and she wasn't interested at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| I mean, here she's got several acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| She's wanting to make it where one person can have that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| and still control most of that land up there for her own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I'm going to be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| And MPC does an excellent, excellent job of being prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| Commissioner Brown and myself used to serve on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And that staff that you have at MPC and the MPC commissioners, an excellent group body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| Well, they may be, but they don't do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| They do their homework very well, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| My question is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| In the current arrangement, there's two residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| and the property is about equally divided between the two residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| And if the anticipation here is that, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| that what we call the front lot be reduced in acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| what can that minimum acreage be if we approve this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| And I think I heard an acre just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| The minimum lot size in the RA zone district is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| So that's where we came up with then there could be four total on the total property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Well, that all depends on how it's configured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| and how you're working with easements and the existing houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| But, you know, if it were an absolutely clean slate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| you could probably get seven or eight houses on two and a half acres, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Let me then ask how large of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| how large of a lot in acreage would this lot have to be to sell the front house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| 10,000 square feet would be a little less than a quarter of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Would you give us your name and address of the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Dan Johnson, 7813 Camberley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| A couple of different things for you, gentlemen and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| I've got in front of me here a report, I guess, that was put out by the MPC earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| Number four on here, when it's talking about the effects of this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| says this applicant intends to further subdivide this 2.51-acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| into additional lots for residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| It's right here in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Not everybody is saying that that's not what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| but it's right here in the report that you guys put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Also, maybe a solution here for this, like you were just talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| if she wants to sell off that front house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| bring that down to the size to allow her to sell off that front portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| and leave the whole rest of it as it is zoned now so there will not be any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| as far as is it going to be further developed and what it's going to be developed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| The main issue isn't so much of how it's going to be, you know, what's going to be on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| No matter what is there on the property, there's going to be additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| And it is very, as you've heard, it's a very unsafe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| There's no shoulders on one side, a complete drop-off in several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| So you have an issue there definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| You know, we'll state this one more time to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| She's only planning to do one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| You guys seem to be really worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| And I don't blame you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| You're worried about what's going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Well, you've got safeguards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| If she wants to do something else in the future, then MPC, there will be signs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| and you'll be notified and then you can, that's when you really need to put your efforts at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| But she's doing something very minor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| This is very minor what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| But she's not subdividing and putting a whole bunch of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| She's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| She's redrawing the parking lot is all she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| She's not bringing another house in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| The house is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| So it's pretty simple in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| And can I ask, do you own the house in the front and the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| My grandfather owns the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| So it's two separate owners currently of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| I tried to do what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I'm sorry, folks, you can't have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| If you're going to speak, it's got to be on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| I was just stating that I tried to do that and only have the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| and that's when I found out I had to do all this because I can't just own what I want to sell RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| I have to do the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| I couldn't just do that because it's all zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| That's what I tried to do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So you can't do that because it's all one piece of property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| The front and the back are both zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I couldn't just do what he suggested and just make what I want to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| and where the front house sits zoned RA and leave the rest of all of it zoned A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| The MPC said I couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Best on my recollection, I don't think you have to rezone an entire piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| If she wants to subdivide the front lot into two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| that would take both of those new lots less than one acre, and we won't let her do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| Oh, the back lot is going to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| It's going to be an acre and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| She ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| But it's a separate piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| It's a separate lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| So if she wants to subdivide the front lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| she has to get RA zoning in order for us to do that because each of the two newly created lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| would be less than one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| The current front lot is 1.28 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| If she splits it in half, each lot would be about .6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| That's not allowable in the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| We can't let her subdivide a parcel into one lot that's legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| and leave behind another part that's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Well, I don't think we're ---- in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| You've got two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| The back lot is going to wind up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| It's more than an acre now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| So and the front lot is a little more than an acre now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| So can you not rezone the front one, RA, and leave the back one alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Grandfather owns the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| If you try to subdivide the front lot, the remainder will be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Because it's less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| No, the remainder is going to be what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| No, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| It will be half of what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| One of them is 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| 1.2 divided by 2 is .6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| You've got over two acres of property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| There's one 1.3 and there's one 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| That's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| But they're two separate pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| That's why I couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| That's two and a half acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| She only wants to deal with one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| We can't tell her to deal with both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| I think that's what you're trying to force her to sell both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| I think the law director might say that that's not really legal for us to tell her to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| Well, what I'm saying is, if she's got a lot, forget you own the back lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| You come up here and you want to get that front lot you own zoned RA so that you could split it in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| Okay, so it's 1.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| So you can get that zoned RA and split it in two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| Yeah, if it's zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| They want the front lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Then if you want to buy the other half of that front one you've rezoned back to add to the back one, you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| You've got one lot that's zoned agriculture in the back and one small lot in front zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| And another one RA you've sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Well, I'm not making sense, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Just say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| You've got two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Land use plan calls for low density residential land uses on this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| and the RA zoned district is the zone that implements that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Her request is consistent with the land use plan and consistent with the zoning that's all around her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| A couple of things to try to alleviate some of the concerns about this, about just if the land eventually gets subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:12| it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Secondly, anything that has to go on with this land, whether she wants to do something with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| or whether she sells it to someone who wants to develop it differently, has to go before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| And that's the community safeguard right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I don't feel that it's correct for us to tell her what she can or can't do with her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| based on what might or might not happen with a future buyer down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| And I don't think anyone would want us to tell anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| I can't think of anyone who would want us to tell them to do what they can or can't do based on what might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| or might not happen with land that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| I think it's totally inappropriate for any of us to sit up here if MPC has done their homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| and they know what they're talking about, for us to try to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| I feel like we're trying to give her real estate advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| It's her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| She knows what she wants to do with it within the bounds of our zoning ordinances and our laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| And this is a young woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| This is her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And whatever she wants to do with it within zoning regulations and ordinances, she should be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| That's not our place to tell her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| It's incredibly patronizing, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| She is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| As long as she's acting in accordance with MPC, there are safeguards in place for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| And I feel like this has gone on and been inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Yeah, we spent too much time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| You did a good job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Buzz, just to review, MPC staff said to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| MPC commissioners voted to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| There's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Sixth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| It's actually in the seventh now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| But, you know, I told the landowners, the opposition, that I would hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| but I didn't feel like that we had a legal way to block this because it does meet the zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| So I'm hoping for the best and understanding that she has to come back before us to put another dwelling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| I think we have to call for or make a motion to approve MPC's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Motion has been made in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| We have a lady that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Do you want her to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Okay, yes, we'd like to have you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| My name is Diane Johnson, 7813 Camberley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| I just want to comment to Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| And I understand your passion, that you want it to be appropriate, and that's why we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| because we feel that this is appropriate, because we do have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| and we do have a right for you to hear our side too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| And we're trying to be proactive in seeing that there may be a future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| We're not necessarily saying that Ms. Presley will do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| but we're trying to protect our investment of what we have in our properties so that future things will not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| So we're not accusing her of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| We're just saying we're trying to be proactive and to keep the agricultural agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Like Dan Johnson had mentioned, just the top part, same with Mr. Brown, the top, the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| be zoned RA and the rest agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Commissioner Brown, do you oppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| The next item is Ordinance O-11-11-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| It's amending Article 2, Section 2.20 specific terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Article 5, Section 5.40 office park zone and Section 5.41 office medical and related services zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| and adding a new Section 4.82 to Article 4 regarding requirements for the location operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| of pain management clinics and uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10th, 1990 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Last month we talked about amending one of the subsections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| and I e-mailed each of you some alternative language last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| So if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| It dealt with the location of pain management clinics in relationship to other facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| and established a 1,000-foot radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and I propose that we add a clause to that that would allow the planning commission to make exceptions to that distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:33| upon a finding that such reduction of the distance is not detrimental to the health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| welfare of the citizens of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| I think that addressed some of the discussion that we had last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| So in order to do that, you would have to amend what was done on the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| but I think it is of little impact on the total ordinance so that it wouldn't have to go back to a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2151)|
| 0:36:02| I would have to concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I don't think that's a substantial change in consonance with what you enacted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| I'll accept that on my motion for approval to add that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| So both of you agree to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Sir, did you want to speak to us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| And if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| My name is Eric Vincent and 1108 Delray Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| I just wanted to briefly comment on the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| I did want to first say that I really applaud the Knox County Commission on addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| I've talked with law enforcement here in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I've talked with Chief David Henderson about this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| And he has explained to me the severity of the problem in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| and indicating the number of pill mills that their office has seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:14| And, you know, I think that it is important for not just the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| but our community as a whole to address the problem of pill mills and drug abuse and diversion within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:31| But I think that that should include not just legislators, but also practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:43| and the patients that are involved in this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| And it's not an easy process, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| But, you know, I think to echo the Knoxville Academy of Medicine's letter to the commission that was read last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:05| you know, I think that it's important that the commission conduct their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| in determining the difference between reputable pain clinics and what would be considered pill mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| And to really address the best way from a land use and zoning point of view on how to really address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:31| You know, I'm personally committed to dealing with this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| I've been to several of the hearings relating to the pain management rules and the pain management law itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:47| And, you know, really am working to facilitate discussions within our community between law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| and practitioners and patient advocacy groups as well to try and address this problem on a grander scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:06| But the issue that I perceive stems from the unclear language that is in the actual Tennessee statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:21| And it carries over to some extent into the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| But the definition of pain management clinic tends to incorporate more than just practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| that are wishing to practice pain management and can extend over into things like psychiatry or oncology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:47| and things like that that do have a high utilization of controlled substances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| but may not be pain management clinics as you would traditionally think of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| And that was voiced several times at the hearing on December 1st by the Department of Health hearing on December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:17| Looking for comments on the new pain clinic rules that they are implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| And, you know, I mean, I heard from all sorts of different people, practitioners, nurse practitioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| psychiatrists in particular, and Mr. Yarnell Beatty from the TMA also raised his concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:45| as to how it would apply in terms of the application to physicians, as I had discussed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:56| whether that was going to apply not just to pain management physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| but also to things like oncology and psychiatry and other specialties like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| And I understand that it's not the Knox County Commission's responsibility to deal with the definition issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| but it carries over into the proposed amendment and how it might apply in terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:26| Sir, your time is up, but if you could wrap it up for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Under the proposed amendment section F that is talking about the 1,000 foot rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| there is a provision in there that requires it to not be within 1,000 feet of a pharmacy or similar facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| And my concern is that that's not well defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| and that could extend over into things like convenience stores or supermarkets or things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| and limit the ability for not just pain clinics, but also other specialties, like I discussed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| to open a practice and to operate in the Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| You know, I think that, you know, I talked to you on the telephone, you know, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| I guess it was about a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| And I've talked to several of the anesthesiologists, including your father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| By the way, his father is an anesthesiologist here in town that works in pain medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| and also with some over at Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| And, you know, I had some very long conversations with the people, with the TMA, including Mr. Beatty, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| who was the attorney while I sat on the Board of Trustees for the TMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| And that's why we put this additional sentence in there, which you may not have, because this was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| And it says that the commission may reduce this distance upon finding that such reduction of the distance is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| to the detriment of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| And what we're basically saying, and you talk about due diligence, you've got to have something to do due diligence on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| So we'll have to wait until these things start working themselves through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And there is an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| And then we do have to do our due diligence to determine whether it's a pain clinic or not a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| And even more importantly, is it going to be to the detriment of the health and the safety of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| And I think that the intent of the commission when this was proposed was, you know, it's one of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| I guess they talk about pornography, you know what it is when you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I think most of the time we know what a pill mill is when we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| There may be some gray or vague areas in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| But I think that by doing due diligence and looking at the type of patients that they're trying to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| what the background is of the practitioners that are there, that we'll be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| to come up with a good solution that protects people who are legitimately trying to take care of patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| with severe diseases from those who are, you know, pushing these prescription pills out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| We've had, you know, a lot of these incidences right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| We've had a problem with one of our judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Just to give you the extent of the problem, we've had a very publicized case of a young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| and it was the Granger case just to mention names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| that was involved with the prescription drugs that resulted in his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| And I know in the paper just in the past couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| there was a young woman who beat a crippled man to death to get his drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| and that's just the ones that have come to our attention in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| So it's a problem that needs to be addressed that we're trying to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| And I think that we have to distinguish between legislation that would have to come from the state on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| and I actually had a long conversation with Representative Brian Haynes today after our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| He was here for another reason, but he's very interested in this problem from what we're trying to do here with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| And the one thing that I'd like to reassure everyone is that we're not here to try to prevent legitimate practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| from practicing medicine, but we're just trying to protect the public from some of these ill mills that we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| I mean, all we've got to do is look right in our own county at some of the terrible problems that have arisen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| because of the easy access to drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And I'm in favor of this, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you very much, by the way, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| The motion is to approve with the amendment, with the additional wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| That is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| No further business to come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111219part2?start=2755)|
