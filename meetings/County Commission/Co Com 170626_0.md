| 0:14:31| Commissioner Bushler, would you like this read into the record or are you going to read it into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| No, I would appreciate the commission reading it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=877)|

| 0:14:44| As would we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| Whereas this year, 2017, marks the 125th anniversary of Tyndall's building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| and whereas Tyndall's building materials, a locally owned building materials supplier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| started as a sawmill operation by Faye Tyndall in 1892,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| and whereas Faye Tyndall moved the sawmill to various timber sites around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| until settling in the Halls area of Knox County in the 1920s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| and the sawmill became a major part of Tyndall's business for the next 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and whereas in the 1950s Tyndall's building materials shifted to the handling of building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=922)|
| 0:15:32| and a decade later the sawmill was phased out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| and the selling of building materials became the heart and soul of Tyndall's building materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| and whereas Tyndall's supplies lumber, trusses, plywood, windows, doors, insulation, cabinets, fireplaces, mirrors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=940)|
| 0:15:50| shelving and garage doors primarily to residential contractors throughout East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| and operates five retail operations in Halls, Mirable, Sevierville, Morristown, and Cleveland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| a distribution center at the Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| and a roof and floor truss manufacturing plant in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and whereas Tyndall's building materials is now in its fourth generation of family ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| as Faye Tyndall was followed in the business by one of his 16 children, Francis Tyndall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| who was then followed by his son Carl Tyndall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| and now it is owned and operated by Johann Van Tilburg, Carl's son-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| and whereas Carl's vision for Tyndall's had not only focused on business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| but also included community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| and Johann has continued its tradition of supporting local schools and organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| and whereas Tyndall's continues to be one of the few remaining locally owned building material companies in the East Tennessee area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| and whereas throughout 125 years of business, Tyndall's building materials has always operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| under the mission to provide consistently high quality products and service to its customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| through innovative efficiency and integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| and whereas the commission desires to congratulate Tyndall's building materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| for its 125 years of business in Knox County in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| the commission of Knox County hereby honors Tyndall's building materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| upon the occasion of its 125th anniversary celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| and wishes the company continued growth and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public will for our requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| How many generations do you have here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| There's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Three generations already here today that's coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| and that's going to continue on in our area out in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| but also for Knox County what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| and they do a lot more for the community than you would ever believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| and we really are really honored to have this kind of people in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| So I'm going to let them say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| It's their honor up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1094)|

| 0:18:21| As I'm the current owner, of course you all know Carl Tyndall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| He's the previous owner, third generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and my daughter, Alexa, she's the fifth generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| This past Friday we had our 125th year celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1110)|

| 0:18:40| Thank you for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| We hope to be here another 125 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1126)|
| 0:19:13| As we continue on, my fellow commissioners, a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| I'm not railroading the agenda, but we're off the agenda just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| I'd like to recognize that we have here in attendance with us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| the Honorable Mayor Tim Burchett, who must be standing there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| Maybe he's trying to raise campaign funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I wish him the best of luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Also, the Chair of the Board of Education, I think I saw Patty Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Patty, there's the Chair of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Also, Superintendent of the Board standing next to the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| I don't know if Super Bob thinks it's going to get hot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| But the most important one of recognizing members of the education community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| and also Alderman from Farragut, Louise Holvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1205)|
| 0:20:18| She's seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| I believe she was at the Tyndall celebration the other day also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Welcome her tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| I believe the last time she was in attendance, she stayed as long as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| Then back to the Board of Education for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Russ Oaks had been absent with cause recently for a couple of three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| and we welcome him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I hear that he's taken back on full-time employment and stood up fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| Russ, we're glad to see you back with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you to all the visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you for all those that are visiting with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Continuing on, still out of order for just a second, where has my Commissioner Bussler got off to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1271)|
| 0:21:20| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Would you like me to introduce him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Commissioner Anders, for tonight's devotional, would you introduce our special guest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Commissioner Bussler would like to welcome Dr. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Dr. Clarence Sexton of Temple Baptist Church and Crown College has done a lot of great work in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| and continues to do so for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| Dr. Sexton, we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| It's my delight to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Charles invited me to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| He said that Jesus didn't call the righteous but sinners to repentance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| so he wanted me to come and speak to this group for just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| He knows himself well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| I want to read something to you from the Word of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| The Bible says in Psalm 33, beginning with verse 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| The Lord looketh from heaven, he beholdeth all the sons of men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| For the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| He fashioneth their hearts alike, he considereth all their works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| There is no king saved by the multitude of an host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| A mighty man is not delivered by much strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| The horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| Our soul waiteth for the Lord, he is our help and our shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we have hope in thee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| I've been a pastor now and in the ministry it will be 50 years in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| It's my joy to serve in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I grew up in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| One of the distinct things we have in our ministry is a Christian Heritage Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| with about 30,000 square feet devoted to our Christian heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| And as I thought about being here, I thought I just wanted to encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| about how much God is interested in what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We have 3,144 counties in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| We live in the greatest country in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| There's a difference between God and country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| There's a difference between country and government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| We love our country and pray for our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| And I'm praying for you that God will bless you and guide you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| I just brought one little story around from our Christian Heritage Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| about a historical character named Squanto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Most of us know him as a fellow who helped put corn and fish in the ground for the pilgrims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| But there's more to it than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| In 1608, before the pilgrims got there in 1620,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| a group of English sailors came to the coast of what we call now America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| They kidnapped some Indians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| One was a young man and they took him to Spain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| And he happened to be rescued or purchased from those English sailors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| They sold him as a slave and some Christians bought him and put him in an orphanage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| And their idea was that they could somehow get him back to America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| They wanted to get him to London because ships were sailing from London to this new country, the new world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| So finally, he arrived in London in 1612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| He spent six years there working at a livery and learning English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| He converted to Christianity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| And in 1618, he finally found a ship coming back to the new world of his homeland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| He boarded the ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| He arrived in 1618, late in the year, and found that everyone in his village had been killed by some sort of disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1526)|
| 0:25:36| So he just went into the woods to hide and to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| In 1620, the pilgrims arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| All of us know that history pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| And there were 102 people on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Two ships had combined because of the Speedwells' trouble trying to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Two people died in the storms and sea travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| When they finally arrived, more than half of them were sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Finally, half of them died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| They thought the whole group would be starved to death and die out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| They didn't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| But shortly after their peril, a young Indian man walked out of the woods, speaking perfect English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1572)|
| 0:26:23| And I think you know the rest of the story, how he helped them plant, learn other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| Finally, in 1622, he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| But God prepared him to help those people who founded this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| And it's a great historical incident and accurately given to tell us how interested God is in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1598)|
| 0:26:49| You take a great interest in your life and in your work, and we're all grateful for it as Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| We pray for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| But you're doing God's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| And as hard as you're working, I just wanted to remind you in this little devotional that God is working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| And he's planning things, bringing things about that we have no control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| And if we look for him, we'll meet him and see him in our lives day by day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| and to see what he's provided to help us do the job that God and others have given us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Dr. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| The Pledge of Allegiance this evening will be led by Commissioner Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Everyone, please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1662)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Now in an attempt to get us back on track in the area of public forum, Katie Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1681)|
| 0:28:11| Is there a Katie Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| Recognize scholarship winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Moving on, Tom Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Is there a Tom Driscoll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1707)|
| 0:28:36| Moving on, there are persons here this evening who wish to speak of 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| Anyone wishing to speak to the 287G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| Please, all of you come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Anyone wishing to speak to 287G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1739)|
| 0:29:17| Is there anyone else wishing to speak to 287G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Normally, and my fellow commissioners, I am making this proposition subject to your not approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| Usually, speakers at public forum are allowed to speak for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| What I see before me are four speakers wishing to speak to 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| I would ask that you consult among yourself there for just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and all four of you will have the opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and I would like to limit that time to ten minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Could you all speak to each other and see if that's agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| My fellow commissioners, do I hear disagreement with that possible move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1802)|
| 0:30:23| Do I have a spokesman for the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1823)|
| 0:30:32| Do I hear a spokesman of the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Yes, ma'am. Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Yes, I actually won't be speaking first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| I'm Megan Barreley-Fogerty at 1408 Audena Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| And we're just trying to come to agreement because we're each speaking to different aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| of how this would affect our community and so we will try to keep it to that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| We were thinking that we would be speaking at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| and so not taking up the same amount of time for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| Sure. So my name is Deanne Pendry, Dr. Deanne Pendry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| My address is 7700 Gleason Drive, number 3C, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| I'm a member of Allies of Knoxville's Immigrant Neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| so I'm speaking on behalf of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| but I want the county commissioners to be aware that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| I'm assuming that most of you are familiar with this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and the idea that our sheriff has petitioned to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| First of all, it's important to understand that participation in this program is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| That's what the federal law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| And the reason that it's voluntary is because this program is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| to pass on the costs of federal immigration enforcement to the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| because what the program does is it trains about 10 to 15 jail officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| to become deputized as ICE agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| That means that the county will be picking up the tab for the salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| and the benefits of those workers every time they do work on immigration enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| It will be difficult to see that in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| because it will be just shown as those officers' salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| but this program is intentionally designed to pass on the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| of federal immigration enforcement to the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| That is, county taxpayers will be picking up the tab for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| So it's really important for, I think, you as county commissioners to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| On top of that, and there will be other people who will speak with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| and I'll try to keep this short and I have a handout that I can give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| that will give some more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| But we also feel that, number one, so the program is going to be expensive to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| Two, it leads to indiscriminate deportation of people who pose no threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| to community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| It encourages racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| It erodes the trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| and it falsely portrays the entire undocumented community as a danger to society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| So I will let our other speakers speak and if you all would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| I can give you the copies of the longer document that we have in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2009)|
| 0:33:39| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, my name is Megan Berrelay Fogarty and I reside at 1408 Audena Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you for allowing me to be here today to share with you my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| about the potential adoption or petition for the 287G program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| which Dan explained would allow officers of Knox County to act as immigration enforcement agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| I work as a children's program coordinator at a local non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| I work with a lot of immigrant children and refugee children and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| So I see firsthand already how the level of stress and anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| that is impacting these children and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and this petition would only increase that exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| I also hold a Ph.D. in human development and family studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| so I know on the academic end all the research that supports the negative impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| on children's educational achievements and their family life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| as a result of these sort of external stressors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Many of the children that I work with are American citizens themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| but they live in families where they might have a sibling or a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| that doesn't have permanent legal status in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| And those parents are scared to drive their children where they need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| because they feel like they could be pulled over for switching lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| without using a blinker or a broken taillight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| and that can lead immediately to their deportation from this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| separating them from their families indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Parents are scared to send their children to school or other activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| because they see every interaction with a government agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| as being a potential of leading to immigration concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| So this keeps them from being able to fully support their children's education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| and again, the education of American citizens in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Children are scared to go to school because they fear that parents or siblings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| might be detained by ICE while they're at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| and they might never get to say goodbye to those family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Can you imagine trying to concentrate on a lesson or a test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| when you have that sort of concern at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| So although children and families already face these fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| the adoption of 287G would drive a much bigger wedge of distrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| between the immigrant community and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| The mission of local law enforcement should be to make communities safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| and deputizing officers as ICE agents has the opposite effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| because it greatly decreases the chances that the community would feel safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| reaching out to them or cooperating with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Victims of domestic abuse are not going to report it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| if they know that this could lead to the deportation of their family member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| who they might rely on for sole financial support for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Also, children are learning to fear and avoid the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| rather than see them as a source of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| This past spring, I had a little girl that was crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| in one of my after-school programs, and I asked her what was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and she said she spent all night underneath her bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| because men had come to her trailer park in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| banging on the door claiming to be ICE agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| They weren't. They weren't actually ICE agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| But no one in that community called the police for several hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| while people banged on doors and yelled and harassed them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| because they feared to reach out to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| And that sort of situation would only be made much worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| if they knew that by reaching out to law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| they were immediately reaching out to people connected to immigration enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| So am I supposed to tell this little girl that she shouldn't be afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| to call the police or ask for help when the consequences might be real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| that that could impact someone in her family being sent away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| I don't know what to tell her. I don't know what to tell these families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And the situation would be made much worse by the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| or the passing of this petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| My name is John Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I'm pastor of Church of the Savior, United Church of Christ here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| And I thank you for this time and for your service to our community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| I began my ministry in three years of service in Ecuador many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| where I received an amazing hospitality from the residents of that country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| And the memory of that hospitality has stayed with me ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| I also have a few members of my congregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| although it's not a Latino congregation by any stretch of the imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| We have a couple of Latino members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And like many of you, I'm sure all of us these days know folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| who have moved into our community from other countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and especially from Latin America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| And I just wanted to share that this for me is also a faith concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| a concern that relates to my sense of what it means to be a Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| to be a person of faith, and bring that to your attention as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| I think we went through this already in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| considering the 287G program back eight years ago maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| And it was concluded at that time that it wasn't a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| for a lot of the same reasons that are being raised now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| But here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Just to remind you, from my tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| there are a number of scriptures that speak to this in the Old Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Aliens meaning foreigners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| From Leviticus, you shall love the alien as yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| For the Lord your God loves the strangers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| you shall also love the stranger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| I was a stranger and you welcomed me, Jesus says in the New Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| So I think all of us are familiar with this concept of loving our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and welcoming the stranger as core to what it means to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| both a good neighbor and a person of faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| And I have to say I'm sorry to even be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I'm tired of having to come out to meetings like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I'm tired of what I think is fear-based politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| that seems so prevalent today in our society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| and the ways that such politics continues to inject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| unnecessary, unworkable, and frankly mean-spirited policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| like 287G into our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I think our community is a very friendly, welcoming community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| We don't need a policy like this that will divide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and strike fear into the hearts of many of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I'm tired of community leaders who use minority groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| and our most marginalized neighbors to generate fear and political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| It strikes fear into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So I long for the day when people of goodwill will say enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| We won't demonize or marginalize our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| We won't divide families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| We won't take actions that I think undermine our precious justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| We won't criminalize those coming into this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| who are just seeking a better life like all of our ancestors did before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| And we will not abandon the principles of our nation and our various faiths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| principles that call us to support, care for, and even love our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| especially those who are most vulnerable and most in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| And from my own faith perspective, that's certainly what Jesus did in his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So I just ask you to consider that aspect of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| and I would pray that we might be advocates for maintaining our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| as a place of welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| and be the people who help bring the beloved community about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| in our own community of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Thanks again for your time and for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Andrea again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I haven't done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I did forget to leave out one point about the financial aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| The other part of this is that the county will end up being liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| if there are any mistakes or misconduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| including things like racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| So in Nashville, when they had this program in place from 2007 to 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Davidson County had a lawsuit that ended up costing them $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| for the way that they treated a woman who was nine months pregnant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| and was picked up on a traffic violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| and was questioned by their officers, determined to be out of status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| and then was taken to the county jail to give birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| and kept shackled to the bed until one minute before the baby was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| So they had a $200,000 lawsuit that they lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| So keep that in mind as well, and I will pass off to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| We are 12 minutes into this 10 minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Please be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| My name is Allie Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| I reside at 8313 Cambridge Woods Lane in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| and since I don't have the five minutes that the woman on the phone told me I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| I'm going to have to abbreviate greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I'm an officer of the Knox County Democratic Party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and I'm here to speak as a representative of the board and its members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Last month, the Knox County Democratic Party Board of Governors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| adopted a resolution opposing the 287G application for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| I had intended to read the resolution, but in the vein of saving time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| I won't be able to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| But I will find a way to get it to all of you so you can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| and I'm just going to reiterate a couple of the things that are in the resolution real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Knoxville and Knox County have businesses, neighborhoods, academic institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| and organizations that include international residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| These people are important to these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| We don't want them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| International residents add to the vibrancy and economic vitality of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Immigration is a federal responsibility, so local law enforcement should not be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| It's also not clear to us if local funds would be used to support 287G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| and we would like clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Even so, we want local law enforcement staff hours and resources to be used on safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| set by the elected officials and law enforcement of Knox County and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| rather than the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| The application of Sheriff Jones for the 287G program included possible monthly quotas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| for the number of Knox County residents that would be detained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| We are concerned that such a quota could lead to ethnic profiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and so we're asking that your positions on 287G be made available to your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| in a public manner and that transparency is held in high regard when stating your positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Back on page one of our agenda, honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| R-17-6-102 will be moved to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2671)|
| 0:44:43| The 103 for Ms. Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| We had our celebration of retirement last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| I wish to thank the law director, Mr. Bud Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| for allowing the participation of Ms. Jill in preparing the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| and helping us work our way through the retirement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| and also the county clerk, Foster Arnett, for Ms. Kim being able to come over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| and visit with us as we work through the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| And my fellow commissioners, you will be receiving a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| An apportionment, I'll call it, an apportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Turning the page, do I hear approval of the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Motion is properly before us to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| There is an add that is in the agenda, which is resolution 302, page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2761)|
| 0:46:11| It's a grant for the community alternatives to the prison program grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| That item will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| In the deferrals, we've already spoken to the item 102, which will be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2795)|
| 0:46:45| Also, I'd like to draw your attention to resolution 904, page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| Page 13, 904 is marked was unanimously approved at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2812)|
| 0:47:06| 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| It was unanimously approved at the work session and will be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Will be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| The box didn't print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| So are there other adds, withdrawals, or deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2842)|
| 0:47:30| Motion to set the agenda and the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| Well, we've got to do consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I just want to know about adds, withdrawals, or deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=2855)|

| 1:08:59| In an aside of a couple of these items, Mayor Burchett, Mr. Vandervate, I attended a telephone company retiree breakfast at Straw Plains Exit Interstate at Cracker Barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4139)|
| 1:09:20| And one of the big topics of discussion that day was the repaving of Corrington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| And the person there that was a telephone company retiree was bragging on Rogers Group for the good work they had done there repaving Corrington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4167)|
| 1:09:37| I noticed that as we've read consent this evening, Rogers Group was named several places in the county as paving roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4177)|
| 1:09:49| I'm appreciative of the fact that we look at every road in Knox County every year and that proper attention is being given to some for repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4189)|

| 1:11:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4271)|

| 1:11:36| So, Mr. Chairman, can we do that at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4296)|

| 1:11:51| Most of it you probably know, but if not, it might be new or a refresher for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| The Knox County Public Library Advisory Board is a nine-member board appointed by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| They serve three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4321)|

| 1:12:17| The library is a department under the Knox County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| The board serves in an advisory capacity to the Knox County Mayor on library matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| Additionally, the board advocates for support of the library at the local and state level and encourages the use of libraries and our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4348)|
| 1:12:40| The board works with the library administration and is informed about library initiatives, services, operation, and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| It is a great group and a great advocacy group and support group for the public library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| So that is it in brief comments, unless someone has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Seeing no further discussion, Ms. Black, we appreciate your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4381)|

| 1:14:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Some of you may recall at last week's work session, I had received an email from Connie Bartlett, the director of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| that the state was somewhat delayed in getting their contract approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| Pull your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Sorry about that, friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Some of you may recall from last week's work session that I brought up an item that this particular agency, the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| was late in approving their contract, and I wanted to bring it to your attention so that we could get it approved for them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| I want to thank Mr. Law Director for working with Ms. Bartlett's office to get that on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| To give you a very brief summary, I was appointed by county commission prior to my service on county commission to serve on a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| an advisory board for this agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| They focus on operating a program that provides substance abuse treatment programs for nonviolent felony offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4485)|
| 1:14:53| and they do an absolutely outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Ms. Connie, would you mind standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| She's been a very dedicated servant to this program and helping those in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| So thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| I don't know exactly whether the final version got attached for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| but in the review, there is an insurance clause, and we usually transmit with a letter that lets the state know that we are self-insured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| and that section was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| I don't know whether you got to see the amendment on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| But we used the letter that was approved in 2014 and went through just fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| and so I prepared another letter to go with it this year and attach the 2014 and the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| I don't think there will be any issues related to that because it was approved by the state last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4557)|

| 1:18:42| We're a very small organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| We have three full-time employees, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| Although we began as civil defense in the 1940s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| our name was changed to emergency management around 1980 as our role changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| to include responsibility for planning and preparing for all hazards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| all types of disasters that may affect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| We first became aware of the potential for severe storms on Saturday, May 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| when we received an email briefing from the National Weather Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| Our policy, as we always do, we shared that information with all the local emergency response agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| and some other key partners, public works, other organizations within and outside of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| 7-14 that evening, the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| and then that was followed later by a severe thunderstorm warning at 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| The Knox County Emergency Warning System automatically forwarded this warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| to those who had signed up with the system and who had opted in to receive those warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| Storms moved in across Knox County over the next couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| We were monitoring the progress of the storms on traditional media as well as social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| and through the utility outage maps, which provide a lot of insight as to where the storm has hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| We also rely on reports from our emergency responders and from 911 to let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| when there's severity enough for us to begin to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| That evening, just before 1 a.m., I received a call from the 911 center supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| who relayed to me that there was a wedding party trapped off of Chota Road due to downed trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| that there were many law enforcement officers out with trees blocking roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| At that time, we made the decision to activate our emergency operations center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| Our emergency operations center, or EOC, is our war room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| It's located at the 911 building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| That's where we gather representatives from agencies who are involved in the response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| emergency responders, supporting and assisting agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| There we share information, coordinate the response, provide a strategic level of coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| direction, and support to emergency responders in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| In emergency management, we are not first responders in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| our role is to coordinate the response and support the emergency responders in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| We do that through our emergency operations center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| which is kind of the hub of information sharing and coordination and support for the emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| To offer an analogy, if the emergency response organization, the responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| all the supporting information volunteers that would assist during disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| then emergency management, if those organizations are bricks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| then emergency management is the mortar that holds it all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| to attempt to put together one cohesive, coordinated response to best serve the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| So that night of the storms, by 2 o'clock in the morning, 2 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| we had activated and fully staffed our emergency operations center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| with representatives from the sheriff's office, Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| rural metro, AMR, also city police, city fire department, the Red Cross, 911 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| At that time, we were getting reports of many downed trees as well as power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| We were aware that the wedding party was trapped off of Chota Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| and that LCUB, along with our local public works departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| were working hard to clear the roads in that area to get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| At that time, we were aware of the damage to the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| but frankly, our focus that evening was on the life safety emergency response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| and related concerns during the time of the storms and the immediate aftermath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| So the good news is that although there were many trees down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| lots of roadblocks, travel impeded, widespread power outages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| and I don't mean to minimize that at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| the good news is that there were relatively few life safety emergencies related to that storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| and we're thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| And I'd like to commend our public works crews and utility crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| that worked hard all evening and long hours over the next couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| to clear the roads, make travel possible again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| and then, of course, to restore power and utility service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Our emergency operations center stayed open several hours overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| That Sunday, the 28th, and Monday, the 29th of the holiday weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| we were beginning to assess the damage and begin at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| to work towards a federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| We had a lot of discussions with our emergency response agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| and with our partners at the state, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| about the damage that had occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Tuesday, the 30th, our operations officers surveyed the damage to the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| and the Choteau areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| We were in communication that week and into the next with parks, LCUB, and KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| Our focus that week and into the next week were gathering data related to the storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| tallying costs, and submitting these cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| again, in preparation for a federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| In order to receive a federal disaster declaration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| there are two thresholds that have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Knox County has to document damages of just over $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| In addition to that, or I should say on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| the state must document damage of just over $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| Those are the two thresholds that have to be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| to be considered for a federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| We were tallying the costs in working towards meeting our threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| We worked diligently with the parks, KUB, and LCUB to document those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| and that culminated on June 8th with a preliminary damage assessment with FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| That's where FEMA comes into town for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| although they call it preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| By that point, we've been working on it for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| The preliminary damage assessment is where we show FEMA our damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| and show them our preliminary cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| so that they can determine whether we're eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| to be considered for a federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| The initial cost estimates at that time, I realize they may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| I think they've gone up since then, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| At the time that we met together with FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| KUB was estimating costs at approximately $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| LCUB had estimated costs just below half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| and, of course, we had estimated damages at the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| At that time, the estimate was about $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| As is usually the case for us, it's our utility restoration costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| that, frankly, tend to make us or break us for meeting our $1.5 million threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| The utility costs put us right at the threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| and then it was the costs related to the storms at the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| that put us over top of our threshold in making us eligible for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| Based on the preliminary damage assessment with FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| the governor did request a presidential declaration on June 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| and we were very happy when this past Friday evening we got word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| that the president had approved a federal disaster declaration for public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| In FEMA's term, just to be clear, FEMA's term public assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| means that reimbursement is available for public sector costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| As you may know already, under the Stafford Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| when there's a federal disaster declaration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| that means the federal government will reimburse 75% of eligible expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| The state, although they're not obligated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| the state traditionally pays 12.5% of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| They've indicated that they'll do so for this disaster as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| and that leaves us here locally responsible for 12.5% of the local costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| FEMA's documentation, they're explicit that they specify that utilities restoration costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| as well as repair and restoration of parks are eligible expenses that may be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| This afternoon we found out that this coming Thursday is a FEMA applicant briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| So working to this point was getting eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| and then gaining the federal disaster declaration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| This Thursday starts the actual process of applying for that reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| and we'll be working with parks, finance, LCUB and KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| on again continuing to work on getting those costs reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| So as I mentioned, that's the public assistance covering the public costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| I'd also like to mention that last week, last Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| the Small Business Administration opened an outreach center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| This is located in Blount County where they bore the brunt of the storms here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| The Small Business Administration is making available low interest rate disaster loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| Businesses are eligible for this, but I'd like to make sure everyone knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| SBA loans are not just for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Residents as well as renters are eligible for these low interest disaster recovery loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| They had the outreach center open through 2.30 this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| So if you know of anyone who may need help with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| I'd be happy to get you information to direct them to the SBA outreach center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| Are there any questions that I could answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| At the beginning you were talking about that people could have gotten alerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| Is there some designation on their mobile phones that they need to activate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| so that they can be party to those alerts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Is it the same system as the AMBER alert system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| There's a couple systems at play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| We would recommend that everyone in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| register for the notification system on the Knox County website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Towards the middle of the front and center block in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| there's a link there to register for our emergency warning system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| Our system automatically passes through warnings from the National Weather Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| provided that the registrant opts in to receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| So anyone on the system is automatically opted in to receive tornado warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| You can't get out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| However, it's optional if you'd like to receive severe thunderstorm warnings, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| This was a severe thunderstorm warning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| so only folks who would have opted in to receive those warnings would have gotten them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| But we would encourage everyone to do so to sign up for that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Great. Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| I know there was a lot of people that had no idea what was going on behind the scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| and so it's reassuring to know that the team got together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| and of course Parks and Recreation did an awesome job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| and LCUB did a good job with getting the power lines restored out there and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| Yes, sir. There was a lot of hard work there, and our work is largely behind the scenes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| so I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| And then just kind of a follow-up with Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| for the 12.5%, does this body need to do anything special in regards to those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| I see you shaking your head no. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| You know at least once during a commission meeting you always have the opportunity to come speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| so this is your opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| I prefer not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| It was just once we get the FEMA grant and we bring it to county commission for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| that match will be on there, and that's when it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I think we will have to confer with our insurance brokerage that there is no coverage on the damage that was FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| I'm sure we'll want that, because typically their money comes secondary to any insurance that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Correct. There will be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I know that he has invited, he and Perry Benshaw from my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| and we'll send Susan Corlew, she's dealt with a few FEMA grants in her time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| and we'll go through that process, and we're no stranger to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| and we know how it works and the likelihood of getting money back and the process that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| And so we'll go through that process for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| I guess this is along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| I see Mr. Snowden is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Can I change the subject to trees down on the side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| I've been getting calls, and this is not as part of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| but Jim has been getting calls, or I have, about trees on the side of the road that's been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Have we got a schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| Will those be, can I tell our citizens that we'll get them when we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| or do I need to call ones that I think are dangerous, or what's the process you think for the next few months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5514)|
| 1:32:03| Yeah, Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Yes, Commissioner, we shouldn't have left any safety concerns out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Usually they resolve those before they leave the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| If people do feel like there's a safety concern, let us know, and we'll resolve those immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Typically, at this point, we should have most of those things cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| If there are a straggler or two, maybe they've been overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| and we'll get out there and get them cleaned up pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| I noticed this last little storm we had Friday, Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| Some of the dead trees are fell, and they're kind of hanging over the road, but they're not coming down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| So I'll just send you emails, the ones that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Yeah, if it's leaning and poses a hazard to the public, we'll remove those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| So just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| To my knowledge, we've pretty much got everything cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Colin, and I'll ask you, I probably have the best perspective of your job up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| but if the commissioners would like to, I'll host over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| If you'll prepare, if you guys want to one day for lunch, we'll go over to the EOC, and I'll host the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| But Colin's going to, the Gatlinburg fire showed us some needs that our mobile communications van is going to need some upgrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| And so we've discovered some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| You know, tabletop exercises don't really show us everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| but when we put some communications into action in Gatlinburg, we had a few troubles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| and then we need to probably look at upgrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| So I think it would be wise for commission to go over there and take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| and I'll host the lunch if, Colin, if you want to do that, or an afternoon, evening, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| But I think it would be wise to come over and see what goes on in the EOC and how it operates, if you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| Yes, I'd love the opportunity to show commission and tell you a little bit about what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| and whenever it's convenient for you all, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I'll set that up to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| And we appreciate you coming, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| That brings us to the end of the agenda that we set earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| But through my oversight, I must ask for your indulgence just a second to add an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| It would require a motion and a supermajority to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| My motion would be that we add a discussion item on reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5665)|
| 1:34:33| I'm just being picky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| So we're going to have a discussion item on reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| The reason that I bring this is because I've been asked when we might in September reorganize commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| After diligent and prudent search by the law department, reorganization of commission takes place in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5687)|
| 1:34:58| Any time after new members are sworn in until the time of the first meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| The question revolves around some people wanting to schedule vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| or know specifically maybe when we might have reorganization so that they can schedule accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5712)|
| 1:35:21| I open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| When is the vacation in question, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| I think, well, the first week, some people, that's got a holiday in it on Monday, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| Yes, Monday is the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Monday is Monday in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| The first Monday in September is holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| You can do it on Friday is the first if you want to do it at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| If you want to do it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Or you can wait until after that first week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Nobody is getting sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| That's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| And this could technically be as late as the work session day at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| It has to be a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| And we have to have it decided by the county commission meeting, which is the 25th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5768)|
| 1:36:18| Do people have a conflict with doing it on September 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| I mean, I've just been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Are you saying we can do it on workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| No, September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| You can do it before the workshop, but you have to do it before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Before the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Like at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| Commissioner Nystrom, it's a Friday, so I might suggest that we do it in the morning rather than the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| Well, it also leads into that Labor Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| That's a Friday with a holiday Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| It takes 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| There may be some people that take Friday, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| So, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| Could we just email the chair, everybody check and email the chair if there's conflicts on the first, and if there's no conflicts, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| Or do you have a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Last year, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| This year, I think we had one commissioner miss the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And that's the reason that I'm bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| I wonder who that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Actually, we've had, the year before, we had Sam miss too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Yeah, but we don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| I have a conflict on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| I do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Okay, so it will not be the first or Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| I'm going to do it the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| It's a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Is that in the first week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I think that the person that was asking, I thought was saying it was on vacation that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| Well, everybody's shaking their head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| Are you on vacation that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| The 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Oh, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| Who's asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Because everybody's shaking that there's no problem, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Monday, September the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Any conflicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| You got a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Just make it the 18th at 3 o'clock or 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| I think that's totally unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| What's it unfair of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| I mean, everybody's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| Typically, I think the commission has done it the first week of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| So I think you need to hold to that protocol, unless there's some extenuating circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5915)|

| 1:38:45| What's wrong with the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Oh, you hear the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5928)|

| 1:38:57| And this is the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| This is not to set the discussion out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| I would rather not on a Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Maybe a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5946)|

| 1:39:09| Are you available the 7th, Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Is that still a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| No, I'm just going the week of the 11th is all I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| Okay, so the 7th is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| I've got a potential conflict then on Thursday the 7th in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Yes, maybe my wife has a business trip up to Chicago and I may be going up to join her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Okay, everyone knows that we need to speak at our next work session meeting about the scheduling of reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5972)|
| 1:39:51| Anyone else wishing to speak to the subject of reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| Are there announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6003)|

| 1:40:14| and we'd love to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6014)|

| 1:40:46| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| This might be a little bit unusual announcement or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| I just wanted to ask my friends and colleagues here to remember my husband's family in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| My father-in-law, Don Carringer, will be having open heart surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6061)|

| 1:41:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| This is going to give you a heads up so you can get your teams together on August the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| You probably got that in the mail about the Women's League of Halls having their first annual golf tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| So bring your money and come and support that league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| I just want to thank Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| That's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| What an awesome event we had this weekend at the bike race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| I got to attend on Saturday and watch the TV of the men's race on Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| The commercials about Knox County was awesome at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| This was a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I told Kim Bumpus that this was a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| Out of a 1 to 10, this was a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| And this was a great, awesome event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| And next year, hopefully, we'll have even more people lining the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| And I was a kid like Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| I was a 57-year-old kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| I got to ride in a chase car chasing the silver Olympic medalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| So I was a kid on Christmas that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| Next year, the commission will have a team in the cycling event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6137)|
| 1:42:26| And the law director is going to be the water stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| I just want to jump in also with Commissioner Daly and talk about what a great event it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| But also, not only to thank Visit Knoxville and the Knoxville Sports Tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| but also U.S. Cycling and the sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| And a very special thank you to the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| A lot of policemen gave up a lot of time to work overtime to put this event on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| I think we also need to recognize the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| who had a lot of people that kept the area spectacularly clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| and all of the service personnel that worked that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| Knoxville was unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you, Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| If there are no other announcements, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6193)|
| 1:43:20| Zoning at seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| I call to order this meeting of Knox County Commission to consider zoning matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6208)|

| 1:44:05| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| Commissioner Bob Thomas is absent on Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| Madam Clerk, would you read the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| The first item is 5-A-17-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| It's a request of Stephen K. Maddox, Maddox Property Management and Sales Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from MUSD, Mixed-Use Special District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| NW-CO-10 to GC General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| The property is located south side of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| west side Shot Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| Your name and address, sir, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Stephen K. Maddox, 101 Dalton Place Way, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Please stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Mr. Green, report of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended by a vote of 12-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| that the Northwest County Sector Plan be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| to recognize the GC General Commercial land-use designation for this property of approximately 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| The Commission found that the node at the intersection of Shad Road and Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| would be compatible with a commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| and therefore recommended the change in the land-use designation on the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| The Commission has received some e-mail comments, most of them in favor of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| and the Sector Plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Is there Ms. Carolyn Greenwood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6345)|
| 1:45:55| Carolyn Greenwood, 3224 Boomerang Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6355)|
| 1:46:03| I don't have any illusions of changing what's going to happen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| but I do think you need to know something about this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| because it's disturbing to somebody who takes planning seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| Me and a lot of folks that I know in Carnes made a point of going to the Sector Plan meetings last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| and the year before, actually probably a couple of years before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| to try to have some say in planning for Carnes in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| And Carnes has tremendous potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| We could ruin it or we could make it wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| I mean, it really has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| I think the next five to ten years are going to say a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| But what happened here is that our plan, our Sector Plan for the Northwest Sector of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| was just finished last, I think July is when it was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| So July of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| And everybody already knew that there was going to be a Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| that there was work on Shod Road being done and knew what was going to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| Nothing changed between when that was finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| and when this decision to change the zoning or to change the Sector Plan was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| And there's a lot of talk that goes into other cases saying, well, you know, something's got to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| And people put some language on a piece of paper, but it doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| People just run right over it and don't even give a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| There doesn't seem to really need to be a change to change the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| There was an effort, one of the things, I'll be brief, I'm about done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| There was an effort that came out of the Sector Plan meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| to try to keep Oak Ridge Highway from turning into Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| That's kind of how we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| That was one of the things that we had some consensus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| We don't want it to just all turn out to be all this kind of ugly strip malls and commercial and no character to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| And so one of the things that came out of that plan was to have a mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| that went across Shod Road, across Oak Ridge Highway to the other side of Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| And that would be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| We would maybe get some different kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| People want some different restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| We've got a lot of fast food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| We've got a lot of dollar generals and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| But we don't have other things that we would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| This went through so easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| It seems like apparently even MPC that did the Sector Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| says it's okay to just change this because it's a good place for general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| And there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| That's all it takes to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| It was a good place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| It doesn't really matter that the zoning around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| which is usually what's looked at to figure out what should happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| I'm saying zoning, but I mean the Sector Plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| Usually you look at what's around it, try to make it compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| There was mixed-use special district around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| There was even a recognition by MPC that there's plenty of other commercial property up and down Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| If we need a gas station, there's plenty of other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| So it's just disturbing that it doesn't look like there's any credence given to our Sector Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| that we worked with MPC on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| It was finished in July, and it gets changed just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| When it was brought up at a meeting, a homeowner's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| somebody said something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| isn't there some sort of a time period that has to pass before they can change this that easily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| And apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| So I just want you to know that because I think it's very discouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| You talk on one hand about getting citizens involved, but this is the way to discourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| Mr. Chair, I'd be happy to address some of those comments if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| I think Mr. Maddox can attest to this, that it was not easy to reach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| There were lots of discussions between the applicant and his representatives and MPC staff to arrive at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| The challenge with the land use designation is how do we implement it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| And that's through the tools we have, the zoning districts we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| The recommended zoning has conditions attached to it that require landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| no grading or other development activity until a plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| approval of the master plan for this site by MPC, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| with phased plans for each site approved by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| So we're trying, we're looking at the spirit of the designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| what was in the sector plan and trying to implement that with the tools we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| And we're cognizant of the amount of time that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| and the community put into the sector planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| We also realize that a node like this at an intersection of two major roads is going to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| and how can we ensure that that development occurs most compatibly with the dictates of the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| I think we've arrived at that with the conditions placed on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| We don't have a true mixed-use zone in the county zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| so we can't apply a mixed-use zone to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| We can't dictate the type of businesses that come into a commercial or mixed-use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| I think with this approach, with the master plan having to be approved by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| the parameters around that master plan will help achieve the goals of the sector plan for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6662)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Commissioner Anders, do you have questions of these presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| No, really more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| I mean, Ms. Greenwood is correct in what she's stating, that we did just complete that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| And going through, and early on with MPC, I think prior to Mr. Green being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| and Mr. Donaldson beginning that process of that sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| I had expressed the desire to the Chaud Road extension, because we do have commercial at Bakertown, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| and to make that more like Hardin Valley, less like Clinton Highway, Merchants Road, and the other side on Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6699)|
| 1:51:50| And so as they go through there, you know, low signage, underground utilities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6710)|
| 1:51:58| And I appreciate Mr. Maddox's team on the Chaud Road side using that thought process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6718)|
| 1:52:07| and we really need to probably look at our mixed-use and neighborhood commercial type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| I mean, this is similar to what I'm talking about with what they did at North Shore and Choteau where the Weigels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| they made it almost into Farragut's ordinances as far as it was designed, but it's not in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6738)|
| 1:52:26| And Hardin Valley is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| It's all downward lighting, monument signs, and I hope that as much as we can, we do that with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| I appreciate you getting general commercial and also understanding the desires of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| and I hope you can follow through with that, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| And for those of you who know me, I've got a history of quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| That's the only type that I really have done and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| And so I felt like also just to address one other issue, that there was quite a bit of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| I got in this after the sector plan, so I wasn't able to be involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| But when this came up before the planning commission, the responses were, and I don't have the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| but they were like 20 to 1 in favor of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| So I think, and we know a lot of the people there have been born and raised in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6797)|
| 1:53:25| so we're going to follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| Seeing no further discussion or questions from commissioners, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Motion to approve with the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| And seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Motion per MPC, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| Okay, the motion that is before us is per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| 5A-17-RZ is a request of Stephen K. Maddox, Maddox Property Management and Sales Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6850)|
| 1:54:18| for rezoning from A Agricultural to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| And the property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| I recognize the applicant, Mr. Maddox, still being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 12-0 to recommend that the commission approve the CA General Business zoning for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6872)|
| 1:54:41| located at Shad Road and Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| There were four conditions attached to the recommended rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| These conditions address clearing or grading and prohibit that prior to plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| Landscaping, the access to Ball Road would need to be approved by the Department of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| and the plan approval would be required by the Planning Commission with plans for phases of sites approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6901)|
| 1:55:12| Seeing no discussion at this time, Ms. Greenwood, you had signed only to speak on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| Do you wish to speak on the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Motion to approve per MPC recommendations with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| And seeing no further questions or discussions of members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| motion is properly before us to approve this rezoning per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Mr. Maddox, and good luck in your endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Excuse me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| I was just going to say thank you to the commission. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| 5-B-17SP is a request of Marshton LLC for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from AG Agriculture to LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6967)|
| 1:56:17| Properties located east side of North Campbell Station Road, south of El Rancho Trail in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6977)|
| 1:56:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane. I'm representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| And we're in favor of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Chairman Wright, members of the commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 12-0 on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| to recommend amending the Northwest County Sector Plan LDR for this 20-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| The commission found that the subject property is currently zoned RA, as is the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| This zoning is not permitted under the current land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| The change in the land use designation would recognize the zoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| and allow the applicant's further request to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| Are there questions of the applicant from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Mr. Campbell, the rezoning, I guess we're just talking about the sector plan change, so I'll keep it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7053)|
| 1:57:44| I'll wait until we do the rezoning. Well, I guess we need to probably do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| Because if you don't get the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| You've got a lot of slope, and then you've got Campbell Station Road, and then you've got the stream and the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7071)|
| 1:58:00| How are you going to build houses in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| One of the reasons we're asking for PR in the sector amendment is because PR allows us to put everything down at the bottom of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| and not get up on the hillside in the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| We've had some discussions with neighbors about the amount of clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| Again, PR allows us to congregate everything at the bottom and in the flatter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7098)|
| 1:58:26| There's a stream that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| It's not really a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| It's just some runoff that comes from a pipe under a driveway above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| I met T that calls it a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Well, the one at the very bottom, at the bottom it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| At the bottom of the property, but not up at the top of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| We've had a stream determination done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| And it is at the very bottom of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| And so any stormwater runoff we're taking around down to where that stream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| Access on Campbell Station is very good with sight distance up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| Where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| Closer to Ranchero or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Yes, closer back towards Hardin Valley, up on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| So we do have very good sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Well, looking at what I see here on the map, and I'm looking at a colored map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| I don't know if you've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| It's got the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| And it's got, I guess, a designation, the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| Is that where you're going to build right there in the kind of the all green with the slanted lines through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| Where the oxbow is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| Down at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I mean, that's basically the property lays, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| I know how it lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| That's why I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| So we're down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| So how are you going to keep the runoff out of the houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| Because you're coming off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| And you're almost, you call it flat, but it's a gully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Well, and it does come, but the road goes in the middle of that gully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| so the drainage will get directed to the road to the detention pond at the bottom of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| At the bottom of the property next to where the blue line stream starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| And so you're going to put all the water there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Has TDEC already approved the look at this property for development right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| We've had, they have approved, I believe, our stream determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| and I think we're working on the stormwater permit currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| because we've got a clearing permit approved to take some of the vegetation that's at the entrance road out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| What is your per acre that you're trying to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| And, again, RA, we could, if we really, really tried,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| RA is 10,000 square foot lots and let's just get, you know, three, three and a half an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| but you have to denude more of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| and we're trying to make sure that we minimize the amount of clearing that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| and put everything in basically the area that's not got much vegetation on it down at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| Precautionary, Mr. Sanders, if, and I don't want to do this without your permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| but if we rezone this property, could we stipulate that if TDEC doesn't approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| it reverts back to its old zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| I guess you're the, because you don't want to put two to an acre if you can't get the, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| Yeah, and we're only putting about 24 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| So we're well under two an acre, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I think the property is like 17, 18 acres off my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| So you want to take a chance with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| So, I mean, we're trying our best to get everything out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| and we're pretty confident TDEC will approve because they've given us some preliminary head nods so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| I'll make a motion to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| Motion is properly before us to implement a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| Seeing no further discussion amongst commissioners, motion is properly before us to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7298)|
| 2:01:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| 5-B-17-RZ is a request of Marshton LLC for rezoning from RA low density residential to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7319)|
| 2:02:08| at a density up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| I recognize Mr. Campbell is a representative still present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 12-0 on the consent agenda that the property be rezoned PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7343)|
| 2:02:31| at a density of up to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| This is consistent with the growth policy plan for the area with the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| and it also is approximately what would be required for the property with the strict applications of the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| in the Hillside Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| The PR zoning does require the plan for the development to be approved by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| Having heard the comments from Commissioner Anders, we will watch carefully and work with Mr. Campbell to achieve the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7374)|
| 2:03:04| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Let me, before we get your motion, I just want to make sure my math is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| 17 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| And we have about 24 lots, I believe, so two is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7398)|
| 2:03:26| It's 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Are these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| So at 17 at two to the acre, it's going to be 34, but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| We're only going to be able to do 24 because the topography just, I mean, at some point it's uneconomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| And I'm agreeing with you, I just want to make sure my math works right on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| Are you going to cluster these houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| I mean, that's the reason for putting them in the low area, putting them closer together, and not going up on the hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| And Mr. Green, you stated that I think that this is an implementation of what was worked on for some lengthy period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7440)|
| 2:04:11| two or three years, slope and ridge, that allows this clustering of residences to occur, leaving the unmanageable slope alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7451)|
| 2:04:24| Yes, sir, that's the goal of the hillside and ridge protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Right, so I don't know where to go for the answer to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| How is it ensured that this 17-acre parcel is not divided at some point in the future and vacant land built upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7474)|
| 2:04:44| It doesn't, and unfortunately I know of no way to prevent that unless, in the plan, that area is shown as open space or undeveloped area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7484)|
| 2:04:56| and the restrictions, both the plat notes that, that is recorded, and I'll look to Mr. Sanders for confirmation or denial of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7496)|
| 2:05:08| and also if there were homeowners association documents put in place that would also prevent the further development of the undisturbed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7508)|
| 2:05:21| Mr. Law Director, I guess he was looking at you asking something along the same lines as my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7521)|
| 2:05:29| If there is undeveloped area as a result of this on this 17 acres, I want to make sure that we in our minutes or notes or whatever of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7529)|
| 2:05:38| are assured that 17 acres will never be built above the residential count of 24 then, if that's where we're sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7538)|
| 2:05:50| And that zoning would have to come up, I just thought that zoning, and I'll look to Mr. Sanders for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| the zoning would have to change because, well, I'm doing my math with the two units per acre, they could do an additional 10 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7555)|
| 2:06:06| If the commission so chose, you could imagine reduce that to 1.5 units per acre would put them in the neighborhood of the 24 lots they want, 17 and 8 is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7566)|
| 2:06:19| I'm not interested in doing that, I'm just wanting to know how we protect the slope from future subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| My use on review that's approved is only going to be approved for 24 lots, so it would have to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| any further development of the property since it's under PR would have to come back before somebody to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| I don't think I could just, since the use on review is only for 24 lots, if I go over 24 lots, I have to come back in front of somebody to regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7598)|
| 2:06:48| I can't just make that, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| But you and I will not be here forever, and some future applicant to some future county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7613)|
| 2:07:02| I want to know how we're protected under slope and ridge if we allow the concentration of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7622)|
| 2:07:12| Mr. Law Director, are you getting ready to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Still listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| And I only do this because I sat through slope and ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| and I want to make sure that the new commission members understand a little bit of what we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| at trying to get where slope and ridge allowed us to cluster development at some greater density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| and buildable land and set aside slope which should never be built on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7655)|
| 2:07:43| and I'm just wanting to make sure that we have protection there that enables that what we do tonight remain with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7663)|
| 2:07:54| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| The way I understand the concern is that there not be over a certain number of dwelling units built on this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| and that they not be built on a slope of an excess of a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| The zoning can certainly be conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| Make it 24 lots if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| I don't know the exact acreage, so I'm 17.13 in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| I'm not sure how to make that exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| Well, what we have before us is two to the acre, and I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| I'm just, how are we going to protect the slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| One and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| Mr. Law Director, did you have any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| Mr. Brantley, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Is there a retainer wall involved in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| I don't think there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| There may be a small one behind one of the homes because of where we are, but I don't think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| The homeowner up at the top of the hill believes that there is a major retraining wall involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| There is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| Commissioner Andrews, you will speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| If I can find my contact in my eyelid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| Could you put, I guess as you're drawing your subdivision, could you put the rest in an easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| or a joint property for the homeowners association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| Is there a conservatory that you could put that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Yeah, and we could do all that, and we certainly will work how we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| I'm sitting here right now trying to negotiate technical language off the cuff, and that's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| We can work with staff to come up with some sort of restriction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7780)|
| 2:09:44| And I think, I mean, practically speaking, the topography that we're above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| the slope that we would have to build above, gets to be prohibitive to even have houses built above a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| because we're at two to one and three to one slopes as you start getting up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| It's going to be very difficult to practically put something up there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| I think ultimately there's two ways to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| One is through a homeowners association and deed restrictions on the remaining property in a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| And another way is to simply slice the unused land on the ridge into the individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| The problem I think you run into sometimes with homeowners associations is 30 years, 40 years down the road, those do expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| And unless you have an active homeowners association, it stays together and keeps those rules applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| Typically, I've seen people take this land and just divide it into those lots on those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7839)|
| 2:10:47| and that way you have assigned responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| With that much land that you're going to be leaving, you never know when something's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| that might require somebody to do something, and that way somebody is responsible for that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| such as a storm that knocks a bunch of trees down, makes a big mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| And, Commissioner Smith, I believe we have drawn the property lines to the top of the hill for two or three of those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| so that they do go all the way to the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| And so it would have to be somebody on that property would have to try to put a home above their sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| which I don't know why they would do that. That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| I mean, I understand exactly what Chairman Wright is worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| In 30 years, if that's left an individual lot from a homeowners association, a group, they can decide to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| and nobody knows that we designed this for that land to stay undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Is there anyone else wishing to speak from the public on this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| So according to the law director, there's no problem if we wanted to alter this rezoning to just specify 24 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| Instead of classifying it as two dwelling units per acre, we can just say delete that and include just 24 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7916)|
| 2:12:04| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| There's no legal obstacle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Can I just ask one other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| Commissioner Brantley brought up a great point about the retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| Where did we hear about a retaining wall previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| That was a property just adjoining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| Are you all familiar with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| Across from Catatoga Kennels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| And it's a steep curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| The upper part of this property is very steep and the lower part is very deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| So there's going to be a lot of dirt moving for sure to level out to be able to build anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| But the homeowner at the top of the hill has been told that there's going to be a retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| He says there's not going to be a retaining wall, but I don't know how you hold all that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| But wasn't it like more than 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| Did I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| Other discussion amongst commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| Roll call beginning in the 10th slash 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8004)|
| 2:13:34| Mr. Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8015)|

| 2:13:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| Back to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Mr. Gill votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8029)|

| 2:13:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Commissioner Carringer votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| John Whitaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Commissioner Bussler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Commissioner Wright votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8053)|
| 2:14:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Commissioner Daley votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Before you announce, if it's turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| you can't come back for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| do you want a withdrawal prior to the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| I thought we were, are we voting on 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| or are we just saying that it's not gonna happen now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| on MPC recommendation, and so if it's turned down, which the vote count is negative for you, I mean I don't want to lock your property up for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8070)|
| 2:14:41| Right now I'm at five to five, I think, if I heard correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| Which would be a fail, because you've got to have six positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| So the sector plan has been approved, the amendment has been approved, and so I'm not sure that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8088)|
| 2:14:57| Your zoning is potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| I understand that, but I'm trying to think of what the objection still is when we're putting everything, when we're going by what the hillside recommendations say is to cluster everything at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8099)|
| 2:15:10| Why can't we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| I don't understand what the objection is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| You'll have to ask the no votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| That's my question, I suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Can we make a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| I don't think I want to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| I mean, this is not, you don't question the jury after a trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| I mean, I don't think we have to explain why we're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| We have people who call us and talk to us about the property also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| But I, Mr. Campbell, I don't think that you're totally prepared for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| Because we've heard a lot of ifs, ands, and well I don't think so, and I don't have that information type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| And I would suggest you pull this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| I'll pull it back and discuss it with you all further with more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| Again, we were, I thought from the MPC recommendation we were good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| And so I apologize for not being as prepared as we needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| Would you consider postponement for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| Yes, I think that's my only call here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| What's the, are we within legal on that, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| And a vote has not been announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| A vote has not been announced, I hear a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| We can't do a substitute now, can we, in the middle of a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8181)|
| 2:16:31| I make a substitute motion that we postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8191)|
| 2:16:38| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| To postpone until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| July meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| Thank you Mr. Chair, I just wanted to address a little bit about what Commissioner Brantley said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| There's a process here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| And one of the reasons why he doesn't know all the answers yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| Is because that comes in the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| For developers to go up front and do all their engineering, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| Before they get to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| Is not reasonable to ask of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Because this man would have spent thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| To come here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| For us to tell him no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| That's why there is the step process to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| Would you like to comment to that, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| We try to set parameters on the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| Using the guidelines in the hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| Looking at the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| To provide those basic boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| Within which the plan is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| And you're correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Asking Mr. Campbell or his client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| To come at the rezoning plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| And all these answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8270)|

| 2:17:55| Based on speculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| Commissioner Bessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| There is slope protection already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| In ordinance to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| And also hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| It's just a plan and a guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| You have a plan and a guideline though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| That you have out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| That people follow when they get to these slopes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| If they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| We can't require them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8303)|
| 2:18:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Thank you Chairman Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| Mr. Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| I'm trying to just remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| From the discussion of the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| That made a presentation to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Regarding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Did he not base his information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| On the surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| Or whoever he talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| The engineer that was doing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| I'm trying to remember exactly the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| My memory serves me right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| We can go back and look at the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| But it was the people that were here talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| And Mr. Campbell is a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| And he's here representing someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| And that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| But wasn't the retention wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Several hundred feet long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| That they talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| It was over a hundred feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| But now Mr. Campbell says there's no retention wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| It's just a small wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| But I thought it was supposed to be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| 30 or 40 feet tall or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Is that what you're remembering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Maybe we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| The original applicant here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| Next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| We have a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| That has a preliminary grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| I should have brought it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| I was not prepared, that's my fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| On our preliminary grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| Which we have submitted to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| We don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| 30 foot high retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Flabbergasted but whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| We'll come back next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| That's what your people said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| He's made a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| Saying he does not understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| And will bring information to us next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| I need to move to Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| I just wanted it to be known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| That to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| With a clear mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| That it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Everything has been in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| Especially with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Mentioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| Future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| Years from now when we're not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| And also that Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| Mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| That you don't want this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| Just sitting out there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| Some family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| To say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| We'll give you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| You can build on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8456)|
| 2:22:28| That question was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| And answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| I believe Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| Did you have your light on and turn it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| I turned it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| And again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| Concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| That are addressed at the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| Correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Commissioner Carson Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| My understanding is that the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Was per MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| Two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| That's 36 housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| I will not vote for 36 housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| You had talked about 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| If the motion would have been for 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| My vote might have been the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| But I cannot vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| MPC's recommendation at 36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| When you really only want it built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| In 24 then you can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| 10 years later, 20 years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| And have 10 more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| I answered that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| I thought we had something with 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| And that was my misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8608)|
| 2:23:38| That's exactly what I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| It's not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| Clear to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| You know Mr. Campbell is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| 24 but we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| It's not anywhere in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| It is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| That this is planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| And he has to go back and get his plan approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| Else he's investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Thousands of dollars today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| You know we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| Well that's why I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| And that's why I'm in favor of delaying it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| Because if we go with the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| I don't want anybody to have to be out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Thousands and thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| Or Mr. Campbell who's worked on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| But there seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| If it's not in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| Then it's not clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| Put in writing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| Let me refresh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| Our memory that we do have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| A motion to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| To the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| Commissioner Smith I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8676)|
| 2:24:50| Seems like we're at a point right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| Where we have several options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| We need a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| To delay this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| And then we're going to wind back up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| Next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| Withdraw that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| We could offer a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| Of 24 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| If that's acceptable to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| And to everybody on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| And be done with this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| I was going to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Keep in mind that there's too many questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| And he's a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| Of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| He's the engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| I think there's too many questions not to delay this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| And let's get everybody comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| Because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| With what Carson said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| He's comfortable with 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| And protecting the upper hill slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| And so if they can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| Until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I think it's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| That way there's no question next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| I think it would be wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| To move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| When they come back before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| With the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| Because they have to have the whole property planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| For it to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| Before you all to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| That planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| How would you react to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| If we moved on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| If they came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| If this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| Of two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| And they came with a plan with 24 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| We would approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| If they came with a plan with 34 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| And the acreage was 17 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| We would approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| The discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Is worth those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| Verbal discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Is worth the paper it's written on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| If it's part of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| Then we abide by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| As succinct as I can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| You're representing the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| You can't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| What his opinion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Unless he's here, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Mr. Busser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| I know that we've done the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| We've prepared a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| Quasi-grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| And a lot layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| We've needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| To start getting ready for the next part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| And we have 24 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| And that's all we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| So we're not going to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| Any more lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| But if I need to bring the plan in front of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| Next meeting with the 24 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| That's something we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| It's just again it delays the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| A little longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| Which potentially moves us a little further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Into later fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| But we will do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| So you've already got the plan for 24 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| Already out there to submit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| For approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| Because of the deadlines at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| I think we've submitted it already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| For the 24 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| Mr. Green have you seen that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| No I have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| For clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| The way I understood the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| It would be 16 acres at 2 per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Which would be 36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| Or I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| That would establish the maximum density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| And that's my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| The protection on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| So if he comes back at 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| Next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Then the vote may be a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| As a professional courtesy to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| Commissioner whose district is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| And he's requested a delay to next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| I'd like to call the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| I have one question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| Director Green you said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| If he came back with a plan with 34 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| On it that it would be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| By MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| Is that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Given the guidelines of ridge top slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| Protection and the amount of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| That is what yields under that formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| That guided the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| The density recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| And the density recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| If it's approved at 2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| That's what we would abide by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| But it would be within the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| Of the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| I just procedurally need to be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| So we have not registered the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| To the motion or where are we in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| We're at the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| And this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| Commissioner Smith's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Mr. Ander's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| Before the vote is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| We either have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Institute that this is moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| To the July agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| With just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Clarification of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| Outstanding concerns for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| I guess a gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| He has a retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| And per MPC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| Recommendation at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| Is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| Yes you're correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| The reason I made that motion is because the owner is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| And I don't want to lock the owner's property up for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| That's purely the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| That's correct I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| I just needed clarification on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| Commissioner Buss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| The last question here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| If we bring back the plan that they're submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| Will that be enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| For the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| Can't speculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| Can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Back what he's going to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| And said this is 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| And we approve for just 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Will that take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Will it move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Seeing no further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| Is a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| To bring back at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9054)|

| 2:31:04| All in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| Opposed no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| The motion carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| For clarification the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| Sector plan amendment did get approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| So we're voting only on the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9074)|

| 2:38:28| The piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| Is an irregular shaped piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| Were on consent and it's our fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| Because we did not check the fine print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| On what was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| At 2 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| We believe that 4 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| Per acre is extremely appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| This property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| Adjoins CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| Like 100 acres of CA property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| At least 5 tracts of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| That have been developed at PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| Some at 1 to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| And I've got the zoning map in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| 1 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| And then there's another PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| I think that's at 1 to 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| That's almost adjacent to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| There's a lot of R2 and RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| Which from a zoning standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| R2 and RB allow you to go up to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| And up to 24 under certain conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| Again we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| Abutting 100 acres of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| A property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| My understanding was that part of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| Process was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| Go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| These dense things to less dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| To less dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| The property is currently zoned RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| Which if laid out correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| And appropriately sized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| RA will allow you to get between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| 3 and 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| It's because of the irregular shape of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| That we're asking for PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| So that again we have some creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| In the way we lay the property out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| And still get the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| So our request is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| 4 dwelling units per acre because again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| We complain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| Our property is not zoned at high enough density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| Those properties that can take that zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| And we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| We've heard the shortage of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| Shortage of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| So our request is for you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| Zone a piece of property at 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| That will take 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| Very easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| And so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Asking the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| To grant our original request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| At 4 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| And that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| Petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Could you lead us through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| Process of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| And subsequent decision of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| Staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| And I'll have to think back to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| This was a minor item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| On my list of things to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| I believe the staff looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| More closely at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Between this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| And Beaver Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| Those few lots and said it would be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| To be quite honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| I think Mr. Campbell presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| A good argument for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| It would buffer the CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| And provide higher density zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| Designations in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| So I do have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| State that the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| Recommended the 2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| But they did not hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| The full request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| From Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| And I apologize for the staff calling and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| It would be 4 and then reducing it to 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| I was not aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| I'll come with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| Where an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| Goes through the MPC process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| The staff makes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| Recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| The applicant should be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| What the staff recommendation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| And in this case it was 2 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| So a total of 4 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| 4 lots on this 7 acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| The MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| Commissioners believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| That that's the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| That the applicant has agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| 2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| They vote to put it on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| It's passed at the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| And the applicant should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| Present at the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Meeting to be aware of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| Than to come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| And say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Whatever the MPC did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| We didn't tell them the true facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Or whatever the nature of the case was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| And now we want to double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| The density on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| I think that's totally out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| When something from your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| Goes on a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| And a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| Developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| Engineer should know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| What the situation is with their filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| I have a real problem with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| When you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| Somebody calls and says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| Will 4 units be ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| From your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| And I don't believe Mr. Campbell said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| I believe he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| A staff member called and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| Are you requesting 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| Someone said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| Are you ok with 4 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| And we can quibble about the vernacular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| But somebody said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| That's what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| That's what the property will take very easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| It's again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| A budding CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| Which again is a great transition zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| Mr. Schoonmaker I understand your point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| And I admit it on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| We made a mistake in that we did not look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| In the consent order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| We were here at the meeting and we just didn't look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| We made a mistake and that's our fault for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| But we were under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| All along that 4 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Was the correct zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| The appropriate density that we were going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| And if you look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| Track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| 4 units an acre is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| The land is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| 4 units an acre is a perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| Logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| Request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| Can I answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| I've still got my light on please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| I know Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| For a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| When he called me about this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| And we were talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| This is an honorable man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| From our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| And I've known him for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| And when he told me the issue was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| And he said it was his mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| But he understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| They asked him if 4 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| Was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| Now that's what his understanding by phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| Now are we going to punish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| Somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| For the understanding of what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| Understood from the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| As being 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| And then be redone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| Because if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| If you're into that zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| If you have no problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| Coming to their meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| The MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| It just goes on consent because nobody challenges it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| And it could be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| I'm not sure what the situation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| But I know this gentleman out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| He's a good designer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| And I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| I think it was a misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| Or he understood wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| And if we're just going to punish him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| Because he didn't see it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| I think that's bad on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| And Mr. Green says it is a good unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| It's a good buffer to do it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| Is that what you said Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| Yes sir that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| Thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| On this RA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| There is a track that looks like 3 dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| That is where you would I guess bring your road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Director Green I look at the area around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| I see CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| I see RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| I see PR at 1-12, 1-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Those 7-8 lots there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| Are actually the exception to the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| In this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| That this abuts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| I can see that there was a misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| But I don't see what's wrong with 4 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| In this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| Do you see any problem with your sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| I know we are not going through your hearing at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| But is there any problem with the 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| That you can tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| I can't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| No sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| And again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| Thinking back to the quick staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| That I was involved in on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Looked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| More closely at the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| The development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| On that small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| That Mr. Commissioner Smith alluded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| Between Beaver Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| And this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| As opposed to the larger area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| I believe what the staff made their recommendation based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| Rather than the broader community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| So you had no problem with 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| No sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| Well I promise you Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| I probably made a mistake tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| And I don't think I'm in a position to punish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| A mistake that could be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| So I don't think 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| At this intersection would probably hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| So I would probably vote for you on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| Yes I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Clarify everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| And Robert Campbell is a good man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| And I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| And his family also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| So when you sent the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| To MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| It was for 4 units correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| Yes ma'am it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| MPC recommended only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| 2 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| Correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| Why do you think that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| Did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| And it's just now being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| How is that just now being caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| Again the reason staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Recommended was looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Impact on those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| Between the applicant's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| And Beaver Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| Why it's just being caught now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| I think Mr. Campbell explained that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| Yeah but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| I mean I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| You know there's times we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| If MPC recommended it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| Okay we should go along with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| So now I guess I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| With MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| The members of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| If they were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| What would they say as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| They did the 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| Instead of the 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| And I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| I'm trying to speak for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| And maybe Mr. Campbell can help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| Hear somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| We did not hear from Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| The applicant on the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| The planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| Passed this on consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| They heard no comments from anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| On this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| We did not hear any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| Information either from staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| Defending the 2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| Or from Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| Trying to defend the 4 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| It was probably one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| 20 plus items on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| They approved the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| I would bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| My days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| The extra pay I'm getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| For attending this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| If you ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| Anything about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Because again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| It's on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| And that's one of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| With our consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| Unless there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| Request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| From the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| Or from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| To take an item off the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| It's just passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| You kind of left with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| Who didn't read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| Who didn't do their homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10200)|

| 2:50:24| As a person representing clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10224)|

| 2:50:48| The applicant asks for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| And they come to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10250)|

| 2:51:08| For it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170626?start=10268)|
