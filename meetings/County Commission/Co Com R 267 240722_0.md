| 0:01:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Ten members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Also joining me here to my left are members of the clerk's office, and to our far right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| is Director Moyers with the law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| Are there any elected officials in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| I know that we'll be recognizing our mayor here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| We will go on to our devotional, please, by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| Sometimes I'll change my devotion on what I think I'm going to do, but this one I kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| because it was kind of on kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| I think we're all at a point the last few weeks we realized that there's kind of a low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| supply of kindness, unfortunately, in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| And so I think that in the position that we all sit in up here, we can definitely agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| We do disagree on ways to get certain ways, and it can get passionate and can get spirited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| but it never needs to get ugly and personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| And I don't know if social media has caused some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| I think it's great in some aspects, and it can be really ugly in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| I think there are some times that you have to scroll past something that you really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| don't need to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| I do that frequently, and it takes all I've got most of the time, but I do because sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| you just need to move on and not get so bogged down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| And we always say we want our kids and our grandkids to exemplify kindness, but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| to be willing to show it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| They're not going to get it anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| And so you can definitely disagree with people, but you need to understand that they're people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| and politics is a complete different thing than people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| And just don't lose sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Sometimes you need to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| You don't know if somebody in a car has just gotten really bad news from the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| You don't know if somebody in the line in front of you that's being slow, that's frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| you may not be taking care of a sick family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| Things are going on in everybody's lives, and sometimes we need to take a break and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| be a little kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| And people are moving here left and right, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| And one of the reasons they're coming here is for many reasons, but it's for the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| because we are kind and hospitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| And we need to just keep that in mind and keep that Southern value and Southern attitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| I bought a shirt a couple of years ago from a friend whose child's autistic, and the saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| was when you can be anything, choose to be kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| And I think that really is really important in this day and time as we get closer to elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| and things are so divisive, there's something we can all have in common and we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| And it may not be politics, but it's not that person, you don't have to hate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| So I think that's important to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And I want to just say the verse from Proverbs 16, 24, kind words are like honey, sweet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| the soul, and healthy for the body, if you'll pray with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Heavenly Father, thank you for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you for the people I sit with on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Even though we may disagree and have different ways to go about things, let us always remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| that we're trying to work for the good of our community and let our constituents see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| that we do have a heart for Knox County and for serving the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I do pray for our county, for our state, and for our country, and for your mighty hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| to be upon us for peace, prosperity, and kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you in your precious name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| The pledge now led by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| Everyone would please stand and give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=304)|

| 0:08:14| One of my great principals from South Dole Middle there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Then he went to Central, and then he went downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=498)|

| 0:08:32| This is a promise that's going to be kept with Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Christie, she couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| We bought land for a brand new Duhopel Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| and I've heard for the last eight years that they don't care about South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| I tell you, yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| It takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Government moves slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| It took a while to do it, but we do have the land, and hopefully, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=534)|

| 0:14:40| Sure. I'm honored to be here and also out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| This is not a baseball field or a locker room, so I'll watch my language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| but also try and keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| But I do want to say overwhelming is the word to describe winning the final game with our guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| The parade was more than overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| And then the work we've had to do, not looking for sympathy because it's been a good life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| but the work has been overwhelming too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So it's little moments like this, just sitting there and then hearing these things that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| helped kind of call to attention that we need to enjoy what went on a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| But it'll sink in more as time goes on and we get a time out somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| But sticking with that word overwhelming, just the one thing I did want to say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| the most overwhelming part of this has been going around the state or being at the airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| or being here and seeing how this has affected people's lives that live in this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| or cheer for the Vols or are part of Vol Nation in any way, shape or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| And again, the stories have been incredible and they're great to hear because everybody deserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| to bask in the glory of winning this thing because everybody had a hand in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| And I'm just glad that I had a small piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| And I know everyone wants more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| But again, for now, hopefully everyone can enjoy it, including our coaching staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| And we'll work hard this year to win some more games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=962)|

| 0:20:16| As someone who's been in and is still part of a family-owned business, I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| it is rewarding but often challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| And we all know starting any new business is daunting, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| According to the U.S. BLS, 20% of all new businesses fail within the first two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1228)|

| 0:21:30| their 80th anniversary with the following proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1290)|

| 0:21:52| in 1940, as the Tennessee Valley Authority began harnessing the raging river to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1312)|

| 0:22:28| And whereas in the early days of dock operations, the economy was rough, and one would often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| see boat owners come to the dock simply to sit in their boats because the price of gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| was so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Over the course of the first few decades, the art of dock sitting became commonplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| Whereas in the 1950s, 60s, and early 70s, many groups called the Lakers and the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1366)|

| 0:23:43| And whereas over the coming decades, the Duncan Boat Dock continued to evolve, adding boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| houses, additional slips, more convenient services, and serving as a home base for countless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1429)|

| 0:28:19| be 10 years down the road and multi-million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| This is a project that people see under construction in the next 12 months and really will be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| that probably is in a neighborhood of somewhere in the $2 million range, which in road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1709)|

| 0:29:48| So we'll move along, and if Drew's able to find it, we'll show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| If not, then there'll be another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Oh, Commissioner Frazier has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1796)|
| 0:30:36| We all know the Hardin Valley area faces some serious challenges when it comes to congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| I'm really happy about this project because it's a cost-effective way of greatly improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| traffic flow in this area, which is good for the people of Hardin Valley and all of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| I'd like to thank our folks at Engineering Public Works for listening to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| and coming up with this solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Hardin Valley has consistently been the fastest growing area in all of Knox County for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| last two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| So as you can imagine, the community has really felt the challenges that come with growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| And it's been very challenging to really keep up with supportive infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So this is a great project to address some of the issues that we've been having as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| as traffic congestion and safety in the Pellissippi area moving west on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| This is the main entrance to Hardin Valley right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| We are primarily at this point along a commercial corridor, which tends to take a greater bulk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I built this road 20-some years ago, and it functioned well for the first 8 to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| Anybody who drives west on Hardin Valley knows there's rampant residential growth down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| and everybody is trying to get to Pellissippi and the interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| So we just really need to be able to build in more capacity for people to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| The road right now is three lanes with shoulders, curb and gutter, and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| A lot of commercial activity has developed over in this community since this road was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| originally developed in this current configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| So my team identified a project to take this three-lane section of road and convert it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| to five-lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| That way we can essentially double our capacity, still maintain our center turn lane for safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| for turning movements, and really just impact just the north side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| Usually people think of these road projects and they see $10, $15, $20 million, 5-10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| This is a project that probably cost us a couple of million dollars and really be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| to get done in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I'm very hopeful that once this part is finished, that it will offer some immediate relief so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| that those going deeper into Hardin Valley will not have to fight the fight quite so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| This is a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| We're going to continue to work hard to get that supportive infrastructure in the Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Valley community and hopefully ease the pressure of that growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| We are working hard toward making sure that Hardin Valley becomes a more mobile and transportation-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=1981)|

| 0:33:38| Referring to the video, that was, I think, accumulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2018)|

| 0:33:48| kind of talked about it and felt like it might be a good way to be able to get the word out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2033)|

| 0:40:00| This, again, is the Council keeps reviewing the rules and regulations, and we found this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| to be rather counterintuitive for the overall good order and management of the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| Department and the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| We understand we, as a Council, discuss this wherein the employee has the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| submit a request for reclassification, but once it's denied, then the rules state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| they can grieve it to us, basically appeal it, which didn't appear to be the best use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| of resources or efforts because the elected Sheriff is the gentleman who makes the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| within the agency, and every employee would then have the opportunity to disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| the job classification they have and appeal it through the current rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| so it didn't seem to be the best way to have the work done by the Commission, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| why we were requesting that it be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| For the record, would you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2467)|

| 0:41:10| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Christopher Manning, 7000 Westland Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2471)|

| 0:41:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Mr. Manning, on the Council, how many agreed to this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| It was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| It was unanimous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| So you're just feeling like it would be kind of a questioning every time something happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| and so you kind of wanted to reduce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| Where this came from is there was an employee, a civilian, that requested reclassification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| and then the Executive Director was contacted, and when we actually looked at it and examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| the possibilities of it, it totally was outside the good working order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| I can just imagine every employee of the county doing this, and so we just boiled it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| to the Sheriff's Office and thought, this does not—I mean, I understand the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| but then the practical application would have been unworkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| I like that everybody agreed on that, too, so that's rare that you get a unanimous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| so congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2544)|

| 0:42:37| Mr. Manning, if you'd just stick around, we may have some additional questions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2557)|

| 0:46:17| Mr. Manning, what was the vote on this before it came to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| Again, Christopher Manning, 7000 Westland Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| It was unanimous, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Mr. Manning, do you want to just give us a quick overview like you did on the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Many of the rules and regs read that an employee can grieve a suspension three days or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| or a loss of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| So logically, a suspension of one day or two days is a loss of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| So it was almost in conflict, and so it was almost counterintuitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| So on a unanimous vote, we request that that be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| The Sheriff did not oppose the change, so that one and two day suspensions will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| be included as grievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Seeing no other lights, this requires a, well, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240722?start=2844)|
