| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| I'm just asking on the, what you just talked about, the Superintendent Search, do we, if we're going to make motions, do we do it at the time that that comes or do we need to make it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| At the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=218)|

| 0:03:57| And I think Superintendent, you want to take it from me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| And I think Ms. Thompson is, where is Ms. Thompson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| Okay, she's on her way to the lectern there, so she will be making the announcements in light for the board member from each district as we give the certificates to be present for a picture. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=249)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=264)|

| 0:04:47| These schools have had significant growth and achievement and the fact that they did it during a pandemic is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| The principals and staff at each school are to be commended for their intentional focus on effective instruction and student learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=295)|
| 0:05:04| They've created a positive culture in their building that has led to increased student achievement and created an environment to meet the individual needs of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=304)|

| 0:07:03| So this is no small feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=423)|

| 0:07:38| This is a late ad from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=458)|

| 0:13:16| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Do we have anyone here from Hardin Valley Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| Or Rocky Hill Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=808)|

| 0:13:40| So let's go ahead and give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| A round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| All right. The next category are the schools that moved from, they were exiting from targeted support and improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=828)|
| 0:13:57| The following schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=837)|

| 0:15:03| And they have moved to a reward school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=903)|

| 0:18:43| That is a huge accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| It's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=1124)|

| 0:38:18| might be inclined to have a speedy, maybe closed-door decision-making process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| find a new superintendent. But I encourage the board to make this a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| transparent recruitment process. Please understand the importance of having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| third-party, unbiased recruitment from outside of Knoxville firm assist with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| the search. The board must act now on the recruitment efforts before an ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| candidate is lost to another more proactive school district. I ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| realize the different weights of your voices, understanding and considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| of having the outside perspective come in to help with this, bringing in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| experts, allowing different legal experts to handle legal discussions, bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2332)|

| 0:39:16| replacement for Superintendent Thomas. So thank you all for your time and hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2361)|
| 0:39:34| Before we start discussion I just want board members to know that I didn't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| these appointments lightly. At our annual workshop I heard a couple of people say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| that we needed representation from urban, suburban and rural parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| district and also the three that I recommended on this committee had all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| expressed very different ideas about how they wanted the search to go. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Ms. Satterfield had stated that she, you know, felt like we needed an outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| search firm as opposed to the TSBA which Ms. Bounds had mentioned wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| with the workshop and then Ms. Henderson came with a completely different idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| wanting a community panel. So I just felt like that kind of brought all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| differing ideas together and that would make it a more well-rounded committee. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| that was how I landed on those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| I move to accept your nomination of the committee. I so move. So a motion by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| Spad, a second by Ms. Horn. Any more discussion? On the committee or the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| thing? The committee. Okay so on the committee only. So all in favor? Aye. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2459)|
| 0:41:10| opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2470)|
| 0:41:21| So TSBA and RFP documents are attached and if we want to have a discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| those things. Yes, thank you Madam Chair. I just wanted to let you all know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| so I passed out some sheets there right after the meeting started. That was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| some extra information from procurement. The document that's attached to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| agenda was actually on bids which is a different process than an RFP. So Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| Myers with the procurement wanted to make sure that you all had the correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| information on RFP and that's that information is straight from the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| County Procurement Code. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| Yes, thank you Madam Chair. I just want to share the reason why I believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| need RFP just for a bigger opportunity. So Knox County, Knox County as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| whole gets a lot of flack regarding not doing business with diverse populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| and while it might sometimes be intentional, it could also be the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| that happens right now in the decision-making that we're doing here. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| I believe it's on like our duty as governing bodies to be able to cast the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| widest net as possible versus going with the tried-and-true of what we know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| who has done the service for us or done the service for Tennessee. So I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| I think we have to do our job in as governing bodies to cast that net wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| to ensure that we're not excluding anybody but more importantly giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| access to people who would never even have the opportunity to if we go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| the with the same tried-and-true individual. So that's why I support an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| RFP. Now we might only get two proposals as we've seen previously but we did our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| due diligence to move Knox County forward in doing business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| representation that is not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| Yeah I I've kind of been mixed. I mean I definitely support doing a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and I was I'm very happy that I think just from our discussions it sounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| like a lot of people thought that way and then after listening to TSBA versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| the RFP process I have to say I'm a little mixed about it but I probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| lean towards the RFP because as we listened to last week should we not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| any of the firms that come to us through the RFP process we actually could choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| TSBA so it kind of doesn't knock TSBA out of it by doing the RFP process so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| think that that kind of I would kind of agree with Mr. Satterfield and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Mr. Watson made a comment that really stuck with me that you know this really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| is for most of us on the board one of the most important decisions we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| making going forward and I do think we've just got to put the best due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| diligence into it and so I do think the RFP process will widen the net of firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| to look at and should we not like who is coming this way I think it gives us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| the option to then go to TSBA. Thank You Madam Chair as I stated last week I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2674)|
| 0:44:42| really in favor of going with TSBA and just kind of in thinking through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| reasons why one of them is the RFP process is definitely more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| consuming so if we go through an RFP process and we don't like who you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| if it's only one or two firms that come back and we don't go with that then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| we've kind of wasted you know a couple of months so that concerns me because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| think we do have we have eight or nine months but that's going to fly so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| concerned that that could take too long. I think that it's entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| possible that if we went with a national firm that they're going to be calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| TSBA to see if TSBA has candidates that they would that they would suggest from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| Tennessee I mean I think that TSBA is a resource for search firms across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| nation who do this kind of work so that's that's another reason. TSBA we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| know we know that we know them we know what we're getting we know what the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| is we know what the time frame is they could start right away. I took your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| suggestion Ms. Babb I liked your suggestion about calling some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| districts who've used TSBA and I actually sent several emails and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| phone calls and I got back I was surprised how many people I heard back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| from and they were overwhelmingly positive and someone I talked to today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2768)|
| 0:46:16| he said they've used TSBA twice now over time. One guy of course this this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| school district that has 13,000 kids they had 40 or 50 applicants so they a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| couple of them I talked to one said that they did not cast a wide net they only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| looked for the South he said you know I would recommend that you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| at the country do a national search and but they had they had only asked for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| you know a southern search. One said he couldn't say enough good things about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| about TSBA that they were a wealth of knowledge and experience and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| appreciated that Tammy Grissom drove three hours to present the candidates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| them when they when they narrowed it down and many of them did say that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| were given all of the candidates to review but they TSBA narrowed it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| according to whatever their specifications are so it was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| positive feedback. As I said I'm concerned about going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| process and getting to a point where we decide that we don't like it we've kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| of wasted a couple of months and I feel like our students have been jerked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| around so much over the past 18 months that we need to make sure that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| this in the time frame that we have and if we go with TSBA we can hit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| ground running get those community meetings going and talk about and dream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| a little bit about what kind of superintendent that our community wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| and we can we can get going on that sooner rather than later so so those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| those are some of my reasons why I think we should go with TSBA and I will just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| remind the board that I am on the board at TSBA Board of Directors receive no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| compensation for that but just wanted to make sure everybody knows I am on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| board and that's part of why I feel like I have gotten to know them a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| better over the last six months that I've been on the board and and I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| like they are I like the idea that I'm that we that I know them and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| they're trustworthy and that they have we know without a doubt that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| Knox County's best interest at heart because we're a member of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| organization so I think they have they would have good intentions with trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| to find the best superintendent for us just I mean I appreciate the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| said that they wish that they had not done just a southern search for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| national search and I mean not any it sounds like everybody's favorable them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| but did you get any feedback of we wish we'd done this differently not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| necessarily the decision of TSBA but just something that they had kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| learned through the process there was one today that did have a couple she had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| more of that kind of she said she said that the interview was a very organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2950)|
| 0:49:32| the process was very organized and made it easy to go through the process I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| would however suggest that you not limit the choice of finalists they asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| choice of finalists they had asked them for three but in reviewing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| applications they felt like they would have liked to interview several others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| she said they will meet with you to understand your needs to so be honest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| what your expectations are and so that was her so basically she was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| don't limit whatever they find I can look at all the candidates and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| somebody else said something similar I'm trying to see if there's anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| that's I mean most of them didn't really have oh another one had some another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| did have one piece of advice considered the salary range they they didn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| like that they put out a salary that was competitive enough to begin with so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| their advice was based and this was a search in 2019 and in Dyersburg and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| basically just said consider your salary range and maybe even increase it 10 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| 15 percent to make sure he said you know their experience was that people were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| looking at the salary range if it wasn't what they were looking for they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| give it a second glance so that was another piece of advice that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| little bit different and and that man also told me that somebody in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| county did not use I don't know what county he was talking about but a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| of his in another county did not use TSBA and regretted that they didn't use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| TSBA and I think I think that's about it I mean most of the other ones were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| you know good candidates that one the one that narrowed the search to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| south they had four they liked four out of the five of the candidates that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| did end up with that were just from the southern region so miss found Thank You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| madam chair and I prepared some remarks here based on what we heard last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| and I would just say to be brutally honest I was very disappointed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| procurements presentation last week I felt it was very incomplete and weak and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| the one-page attachment today looks very complex and complicated and as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| horn said time-consuming and I believe takes away some board control two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| that stood out was met with mr. Myers was questioned he said we will try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| develop the scope of work and that wasn't just real reassuring to me and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| didn't seem to know a whole lot about school related searches the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| troubling thing was when asked about the number of candidates related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| search for health positions he acknowledged they received only two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| later blamed it on the climate of health care but I'm sorry my feelings are given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| the salary of those positions and the location of Knox why I feel like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| an inadequate explanation TSBA's average candidates as 19 and even our in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| search for a superintendent last time produced 25 quality candidates I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| KCS is under a mandate and I just question if we could get more than two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| and then on the other hand if you look over the TSBA that we had attached today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| miss Grissom last week answered and addressed all questions by this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| concisely with confidence and competence including 13 questions mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Watson submitted prior to our meeting and then reading over the 12 page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| attachment today I believe they can produce an excellent search so those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3205)|
| 0:53:34| my thoughts on the RFP and TSBA. Mr. Watson. Thank you madam chair. Miss Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| just a point of clarification I think that the presentation last week was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| talking about two candidates for search firms for that position it wasn't actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| candidates for the position I just want to make make sure that's clear because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| that would be very discouraging if they only brought two candidates I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| think that process is went underway yet also I I've made some of these comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| before but just to reiterate them I really appreciate miss Grissom and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| the work that she did to come last week virtually and speak to the board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| share the process that they have also asked questions answered questions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| advance I still think in terms of the ability to find a search firm we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| comparing TSBA to itself we don't know what other possibilities are out there I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| also spoke to one other district that used TSBA it was a larger district in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| the state of Tennessee they said they they did a fine job they said no bells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| and whistles which you know I don't think anybody was expecting that based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| off the presentation last week they made a comment that they were okay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| diversity I would like miss Babb said I do think this is probably the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| consequential decision we'll make in the next few years in terms of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| superintendent search firm and I want us to not firm but the superintendent and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| want to make sure that we're doing all that we can in terms of due diligence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| be able to see what's out there again it's nothing against TSBA but it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| cookie cutter approach we know that there's not a lot of opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| to speak into different types of services it's not kind of an a la carte| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| kind of approach and although I think mr. Myers last week was accurate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| you know they would help us build a scope of work I really think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| job of the board to build up the scope of work for the search firm so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| wouldn't depend on procurement to outline all the things that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| need within a search firm process and I think that some of the work that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| search committee that we just approved would do is help flesh out what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| scope of work would be for that search firm and what the possible possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| might be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| this morning thank you madam thank you madam chair that's one of the one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| concerns with the RFP process is the issue of the scope of work and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| helping put that together how I guess my question is twofold how would we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| and how long is that going to take how much time is that going to take us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| because I can see that taking longer than would be optimal and pushing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| further down the line so that's a concern for me so what when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| about having input on that RFP can we talk about what that looks like and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| that process would be I'm mr. Dupler maybe I don't know if maybe or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| mr. Myers is here but I'm just concerned about that I think I think mr. Myers is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| here and I think he can certainly speak to that and and I know that I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| his department would would do a great job I mean you know but it's but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| really up to the board to weigh the pros and cons of each of each process but go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| ahead thank you madam chair members of the board Matt Myers Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Director of Procurement the RFP process is you know the document itself is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| basically already created you know there are several sections that we have and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| use in all RFPs what we would ask the board or the committee would be a scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| of work that scope of work would could be a page it could be five pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| whatever you come up with we fold it into the document and then it's ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| go out once it's been reviewed again and everybody sign off on so that scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| work you know I said I'm sure I said last week that we would help you know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| have some resources you know we have our in our National Association that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| can you know reach out to and see if anybody else has done that I'm sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| have you know the scope of work that we did for the medical director and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| public health officer you know were written in-house we use some of HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| documents that we had as well so when I said that we would help you we'll help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| put it together but you know we would need that scope of work from you all so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| I guess my question is so if we're if the board is involved in that process I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| would assume we would vote on that Mr. Dufler and I mean that would be then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| November at the earliest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| yeah yes thank you madam chair thank you miss horn so it could be done I mean a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| couple different ways but but but but I would I would agree that probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| best way is to put together some type of document I mean what I would envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| one way to do it would be for you all to to submit individual you know opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| on on what the scope of work what what you want it to look like that can then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| be put put together by miss miss Coatney or you know or somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| administration and then come back with some type of a of a document that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| that would entail the scope of work and then the board could could vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| and then that way then it would really be up to procurement to do what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| need to do okay thank you so we're looking at we did that in November then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| December January for two months of for procurement so we're looking at beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3569)|
| 0:59:37| February all right I think that's concerning mr. McMillan thank you madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3577)|
| 0:59:49| chair I think I've spoken previously about my preference I think that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| important that we find somebody who understands our expectation and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| we share a lot of the same expectation we don't maybe notice here all because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| the Knox County is so different different parts different areas but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| somebody that can understand that and can adjust to that I don't care whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3622)|
| 1:00:30| they're you know from here from East Tennessee or North Carolina I probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| wouldn't my personal preference I wouldn't go way out I wouldn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| somebody from New York I just I just take that right out that's my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3646)|
| 1:00:59| and in reference to in reference to miss Babs comment about maybe we could go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3659)|
| 1:01:10| there and see what's out there you know if we didn't like two or three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| whatever I couldn't help but think about you know this is simplistic but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| it speaks to the point it'd be like being the third person that was asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| go to prom would you like that I don't know that miss Grissom and TSBA would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3689)|
| 1:01:39| feel that way but they if if we did that scenario they would have every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| right to thank you miss bounds I think this is highly highly important before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3705)|
| 1:02:03| we vote I'd like to remind this board at the University of Tennessee fired three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| presidents in a span of ten years these presidents were a result of a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| search from a search firm from search firms hired by the Board of Trustees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| additionally prior to Superintendent Thomas and the board I chaired previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| boards hired national search firms which resulted in two superintendents being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| fired terminated or resigning under questionable practices so I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| we can say that a national search firm or a national candidate does ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| success or guarantee the best and I think we have to look at what's right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| front of us as far as the University of Tennessee and the lack of success they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| had and Knox County schools and prior to super and Tom and Thomas we hired two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| resigned or five mr. Watson thank you madam chair mr. Dupre we could call a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3781)|
| 1:03:11| special called meeting and approve a scope of work prior to the November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| meeting correct yes I mean the chair can call it or the board can call it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| majority yeah I think just in the next nine months there we may end up having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| some need for some special call meetings I'm not saying that this is necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| a time but I think that that could happen also I think some of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| that would be done between now and January 1 or whatever could there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| concurrent work that could also be happening I think we could run in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| community engagement process you know even while we're looking at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| considering possible search firms and then terms of the terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| development of a scope of work you know we we had some conversation around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| at our retreat and I think I presented a combination of three different scopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| of work that both from our process last time internally also from some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| through TSBA and then also from another district in another state so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| that the when I talked to some other districts they said have said that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| scope of work development process has taken them two to three hours to carve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| out and get that done and I don't think we have to start from scratch I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| think there's a lot of there's a lot of possibilities out there about what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| could include a scope of work I don't think we'd have to start from a blank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| slate thank you madam chair thank you Susan for bringing the information it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3872)|
| 1:04:42| did give me more insight about what TSBA can offer and also just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| testimonies from other people that went through the process so that was good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| thank you so much so I just want to clarify if there's any confusion among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| the boards my opposition isn't with TSBA I do still believe that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| cookie-cutter in the process but that information you provided is good to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| me a little hope that they'll be able to do a good job my opposite my my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| reasoning for RFP is just making it as clear as possible that is these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| decisions that continues to keep Knox County in the bottom pool when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| to working with diverse businesses and opportunities as a whole and so is it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| this moment here not the moment of the RFPs or the moment other people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| come into the county but it's the decision-making that we make at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| moment to not even open it up to provide the access that's keeping Knox County at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| the bottom from that area so that's where my clarity is not necessarily TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| I do think that they'll do a great job but just doing community forums if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| were going to do community forums during while we're waiting throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| the RFP process are we assuming that our staff would conduct those what like can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| we just talk about that because to me that's a big deal because our staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| stretched right now and I don't think we should put anything else on them so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| would be a concern for me and that is actually why I put recommended miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Henderson to be on the committee and because she wanted a community based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| search and Knox Education Foundation has graciously offered to help facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| that those community discussions so I think we can do that working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| and we can have a good healthy input from the community that way okay as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| as you know just what the community wants to see okay all right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| superintendent and I will say that you know I do the problematic part for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| about the RFP is the timepiece because I can see and as with other things we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| done just kind of getting you know hung up on on things and not being able to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4015)|
| 1:07:04| move forward and I do think that we need to have someone in place before school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| starts next year so I'll make a motion to go with TSBA for our superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4029)|
| 1:07:22| search so there's a motion by Miss Warren to use TSBA for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4042)|
| 1:07:31| superintendent search a second by Miss Henderson and it's just now for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4051)|
| 1:07:47| motion um if we vote not to go ahead with TSBA now could we still vote in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| favor of TSBA in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4075)|

| 1:08:06| what I'm hearing tonight would be that you're not going to go with if a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| no would be not to go with TSBA now but perhaps in the future as has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| discussed after an RFP so any more discussion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4095)|

| 1:08:51| five yes votes and four no votes so motion carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| I'm sorry madam chair I know we so we had two motions within that one agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4138)|
| 1:09:18| item but as the agenda item closed the discussion because I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| related to what we just decided I mean we can yeah so the reason I'm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| question I have is there's two fee basis is for TSBA there's the $6,500 one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| there's a $11,500 one and miss horn did not clarify so I don't know what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| actually just bought that's a good point I make a motion to go with plan B which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| is $11,500 and the difference we since we have now decided that we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| with TSBA I would like to make a motion that we are going with plan B which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| the 11-5 is that I believe that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| thank you and just to clarify the $11,500 involves their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| engagement process so I think it's important for the board as we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| this potential vote I don't know that using their process limits us doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| another process as well but you know we are in some ways deciding how much do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| want to engage the community in this vote so right and so technically I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| it's called plan to you I'll just correct myself do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| miss Beth yeah in you know I mean I was for the RFP but I mean I think TSBA can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| do a good job too so it's not like I'm upset about this vote um I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| and I guess I'm probably talking to the committee members that we have elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| is to maybe talk to TSBA I mean I definitely I'm gonna support that we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| with the fuller project but even on that I feel like a lot of our discussion has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| been around wanting community engagement involvement and I do think when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| to Tammy it seemed a little cookie-cut that was probably my biggest like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| just do it this way and everything that maybe we could talk about some expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| their services even if it costs a little bit more or if there's more of we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| engage another group to do further community engagement I just and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| just feel like that discussion to happen with them like I said I don't really I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| do think that they can do a good job for us I think maybe just exploring a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| bit of their cookie-cutter Ness and if can they can expand to work with maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| some other things that we want miss Ellen Thank You madam chair I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| suggest a friendly amendment to include community input facilitation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| Knox said foundation with in addition to what TSBA does yes so TSBA's plan B and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4309)|
| 1:12:00| when we talked to Tammy last time she said that she could include whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| feedback we wanted to put in with it so to include the community input that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| discussed done by the Knox said foundation so that wouldn't be any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| for TSBA but it would get that yeah I'm fine with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| I got a question what what exactly are they gonna do are they gonna offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4339)|
| 1:12:39| advice are they gonna be all as a secondary now we we we said here voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| on it we've chosen somebody and now I'm not gonna be a party to sitting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| and trying to hack it up and that's kind of what you all are doing it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| I have no I have no qualms with them offering their opinion I have matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4380)|
| 1:13:16| fact I would love to see Tammy Grissom and miss Babb have a good conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| and her to get out all what she wants to roam and find all these supernatural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| people but seem to she thinks this but I think it's pretty simple and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4411)|
| 1:13:40| y'all trying to complicate it now as far as a little bit more money if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| to do something if Tammy wants to take it up to you know what it was it 11 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| so well somewhere limbs up if we don't take it up to 20,000 or 25,000 and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| do some expanded work but I want them to do the work I don't want you know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| don't want to help her over here you what so that was actually what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| suggested Mike just just a touch base though on the work Knox Ed Foundation I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| mean they are in our community I mean they've got the input for the ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| funding they just facilitate the community meetings and bring back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| what the community if if that's what they do I'm fine with that you know but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| as I've said before you know I want somebody that understands East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4474)|
| 1:14:43| Knox County values now you know you could be a superintendent in some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| these counties where it would just be like you'd have maybe two or three high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| schools and a few middle schools and elementary schools and it's nothing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| mean compared to what Knox County is with the number of people that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| employ the number of kids we serve and people move from other counties because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| they don't have the services that we offer and they've done it for years I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| not complaining about it I'm just saying it as a statement of fact we're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| third largest district in the state of Tennessee and I think we're probably in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| the low 70s about five or six years ago we were the 75th I think largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| district in the entire United States so I have no problem with you getting extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4547)|
| 1:15:56| extra input as long as everybody understands what we're doing and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4556)|
| 1:16:05| want thank you and I'm gonna miss Henderson first thank you madam chair I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| just want to agree with what miss Christie said you know KF is in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| community they are in our schools but maybe our committee could work with TSB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| or work with KF and negotiate kind of their roles and then bring that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| maybe that's something that the committee could work on and bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| to the full board just a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4589)|
| 1:16:36| mr. Watson thank you madam chair I agree with that misunderstanding I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| that's part of the role of that subcommittee is to help negotiate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| additional pieces to this I think with that being said I and again this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| nothing it's TSBA I don't know that if we want to consider using KF which I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| think based on Tammy's presentation last week and what we know about KF's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| community engagement work they would be able to do a more robust process than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| what Tammy and them are able to do and that's because they decide here's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| guardrails in which we're going to do it we're gonna have four meetings on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| day and then we're going to tell you what we learned I don't know that paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| an additional $5,000 for that and then also bringing in KF which would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| and then much more I would assume it is needed so my preference would be is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| we contract TSBA at the $6,500 level let them do their core service and then let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| the subcommittee decide on how to engage KF in a more robust community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| engagement process because as I said several times I think some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| things can happen concurrently and KF is already in our community they've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| helped us with community engagement work in the past they know what works in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| community how people have responded how to get people to the table so I'm if KF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| was not here I would say let's spend $11,500 and use their service for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| community engagement but I think it's a little bit duplicitous to to do both I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| just don't know that we need both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| miss Ellen thank you madam chair my purpose for offering the amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| include KF was because when I asked Tammy last week whether TSBA would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| willing to have more community input than just the one day she was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| opposed to that so if we really want a great deal of community input then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| think we need to take every opportunity to gather that community input and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| TSBA's process doesn't include it but they are willing to take other input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4720)|
| 1:18:48| which she said she was then I want that community input. Thank you madam chair I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4728)|
| 1:18:58| have no opposition to this board utilizing KEF and they have been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| vital part of the community and the predecessor to KEF has been a vital part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4743)|
| 1:19:10| of the community I just didn't I really don't I have problems with it being put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| forth as a friendly amendment and being done like that I thought miss Henderson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| suggestion was much better and bringing it back to the whole board and and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| think that puts us also in singling out one group I mean are we you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| amendment before us is only for KEF but that kind of singles out one specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| group and I would rather just do it in a framework other than a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| but that's just my opinion and I would have to go back and pull up the 12-page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| document which I don't have in front of me but I thought miss Horne may be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| to correct that I thought the 11,500 included more than just the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| input so if that's the case I would support the 11,500 and there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| additional cost in there for TSBA for I don't remember what it was now but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| thought it was a good idea so I think we would have to cap maybe like we did last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| time the amount of money we're gonna spend on a superintendent search but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| this would be the baseline and I think mr. Watson indicated that KEF would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| their work at no cost maybe I'm not sure about that but anyway I just I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| don't think we should use this approach in a friendly amendment and buy TSBA's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| hands. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4837)|
| 1:20:50| Yeah mine was just on the 11,500 I think I sort of agree with Patty that I felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| like there was more than just. I have it right here it's attached to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| So is okay so is the only difference once again is what is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4867)|
| 1:21:21| I mean there's some of like the interviewing the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| okay. Mr. Watson. Yes madam chair I was just going to say that the I mean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4887)|
| 1:21:38| there's five bullet points for the additional $5,000 they reads provide all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| services listed in plan one which would be obvious conduct employee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4902)|

| 1:21:49| then report the results to the board so for that $5,000 the only thing that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| think we're guaranteed and in the additional services is the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| engagement piece and so again I would recommend like Miss Bounds as well and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Miss Anderson that the committee be tasked with trying to figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| do that community engagement piece with the support KEF and I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| we need the additional $5,000 in services from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| Mr. McMillan. Well I think I think you're right I think if that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4939)|
| 1:22:28| question I think is if we really it really is all that plan to really is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| around the community input so if we want the input and the recommended criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| from TSBA in addition to KEF and we should go with that if we don't then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| $6,500 would be sufficient if but back to back to I think what Miss Bounds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| Miss Henderson have said you know it may be better to work through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| separately I don't know but so I'm not sure if we need the additional support I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4977)|
| 1:23:05| guess so maybe the $6,500 would be adequate perhaps. I kind of like the I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4985)|
| 1:23:15| mean I kind of like the idea of the plan to and doing it in concert I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| like we get that way you get the viewpoint because TSBA included is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| that is they're recommending their criteria so they're a completely outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| agency that is then bringing back what they saw and it's not it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| very you know completely unbiased look at what they heard and saw so we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| want it just to have both viewpoints it could offer I think that you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| may be worth the extra time and money so any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5028)|
| 1:23:57| Miss Bounds. This might be a Mr. Duport question. We voted on TSBA do we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| decide on the level tonight because I almost feel like I would like our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| three-person committee to talk to TSBA a little bit and explore this and sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| of look at how they can do it but do we need to decide I mean it's $5,000 I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| mean I'd really I mean I know $5,000 maybe a lot of money but in the grand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| scheme of our search I'm just wondering if we could have the three-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| committee really talk to TSBA and evaluate what they can bring and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| or do we need to decide on this level or that level tonight I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Sure yeah thanks Madam Chair and thanks Miss Babb the answer is the board's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| charge so so you all talk it out and figure out which way you want to go I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| mean frankly you could I mean you could do it whichever way that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| decides to do it you could go with one of the two plans you could add KEF you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| could leave a piece I mean literally you all decide how you want to do it I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| And we do have a motion on the floor okay and Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| Chair last comment I think based on that conversation Miss Babb and Mr. Dupler I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| I think let's go ahead and approve the minimum contract the $6,500 and then let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| the committee talk to KEF and TSBA and then add if we want to add the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| additional services of TSBA later can we do that? Should I withdraw my friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| amendment? Is that easy? I mean yeah yeah somebody's gonna have to yeah withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| something and then you know. Well did you you're next do you want to or are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5139)|
| 1:25:52| going to make another motion if she's withdrawing her? Okay so the motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| we have on the floor is to approve plan B plan 2 so my thoughts are this I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| I could offer and I could amend my motion to approve this contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| TBA TSBA up to $11,500 which would then give the ability to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| three-person committee to determine which one to go with. Second. Okay so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5178)|
| 1:26:27| that's my official amendment. Wait a minute. Okay but Mike wants to speak. Mr. McMillan. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| committee would decide whether it was $11,500 or $65,000. You know as Mr. Dupler said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| the board's in charge and it appears to me that the people who lost just are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5204)|
| 1:26:57| very slyly sophisticated trying to hack into it again. If you lose if you lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5217)|
| 1:27:11| you know you ought to shut up if you lost. Okay we have a motion on the floor in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5231)|
| 1:27:23| second. What is the motion? The motion was to approve up to $11,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| TSBA search by Ms. Horn seconded by Ms. Satterfield. I thought I seconded that one. Or seconded by Mr. McMillan. I don't care at this point. You did the first one but she withdrew it. Okay I'm sorry. Yes she withdrew that one. I stand corrected. Okay so. Is that it? That's what's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5251)|
| 1:27:56| floor right now. Yes. So what about all this other stuff? The committee would work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| Knox Ed Foundation and TSBA with how they're going to do the community. So they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| official role in it at this point? Correct. Let's go. Okay Ms. Horn or okay so I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5289)|
| 1:28:21| while the while we have our committee gathered here for the search committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| my vote would be to go with the 11-5. I'm willing to I'm fine if you don't but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| my recommendation as a board member would be to go with 11-5. I really like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| the idea of having a completely outside agency do it's only one day of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| meetings but do that day of community meetings and then in addition to whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| you guys decide with Knox Ed Foundation but so that is just I just want the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| board to know my the committee to know my intention what I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| Somebody state what we're actually voting on. I believe the motion on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| approve TSBA for a superintendent search service up to $11,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| So did you have anything seconded by Ms. Satterfield? Ms. Satterfield? Yes. Ms. Owen? Yes. Mr. Watson? Yes. Ms. Babb? Yes. Ms. Horn? Yes. Ms. Henderson? Yes. Ms. Bounds? Yes. Mr. McMillan? Yes. Ms. Christie? Yes. That's nine yes votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5355)|
| 1:29:44| Well again I think the original motion is still on the floor for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| discussion so I just wanted to bring up one more point for the subcommittee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| be considering as they do their work since we don't meet together often. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| that okay? Because the discussion is still up right that agenda item until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| Ms. Christie closes it. I was talking about the actual agenda item which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5403)|
| 1:30:18| discussion around the superintendent search and I just had one comment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| the for the committee to consider. Okay. Yeah so and I don't think this has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| up in any of our conversations yet but I know one of the things I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| one of the things that the committee is going to be doing is considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| timeline for the hiring. I know that the superintendent has announced that his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| retirement would end at the end of June which means if we hired somebody the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| that would start let's say the next day then they basically have a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| than a month before the start of school into that role. I talked to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| superintendent this past week to see if if there's any precedence into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| overlapping time with superintendents. I would advocate for us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| hiring a new superintendent by the close of this current school year and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| some overlap that's been done in the past. Here obviously we would have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| little bit of overlap in salary during that time but I think it'll be worth it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| to give that superintendent if we can make that timeline the whole summer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| engage. So I just think that's an important consideration for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| committee to consider as they're developing the timeline is to possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| think about overlapping some of that time toward the end. So we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| take a short break before we do public forum. Okay 645 we will come back at 645.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5495)|
| 1:31:44| Okay we are back and I'm going to turn this over to Ms. Satterfield for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| forum. Thank you Madam Chair. Just a few reminders as we start public forum. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| board respects public forum speakers. The board requests public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| speakers to address remarks to the entire board and not individual members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| Each person speaking shall state his or her name and county of residence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| have up to three minutes to make remarks unless time is extended by majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| the board. Members, the board respects and appreciates the good intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| that bring citizens to speak at public forum. The board asks that speakers show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| their respect to the board, the staff, and other citizens by speaking in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| that is civil and courteous. Again and also if you can speak directly into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5549)|

| 1:33:05| and I wanted to bring it to the entire board's attention of the sexual assault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| situation that's going on at Gibbs Middle School right now. I have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5589)|

| 1:34:22| have come forward because the other girl is too afraid to come forward. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| morning I was made aware that there is possibly another victim coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| and who knows how many more. These are just the eight maybe nine that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| of right now. The school, Candice Greer, the head principal, has done has not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=5676)|

| 1:43:50| reasons that she would like to speak for five minutes and I said I would ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6230)|

| 1:44:19| Okay we'll vote. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6259)|

| 1:44:46| In that speech I explained everything that happened with Alec last year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| why the board why this board and the school system needed to be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| prepared this year. I explained that Alec and other kids like him could not wear a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| mask or do virtual learning. In that speech I made suggestions such as having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| a separate school for children with disabilities who could not wear masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| and could not learn virtually. I know at least one board member listened to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6304)|

| 1:45:11| appreciated. My issue is that from an outside perspective it looks once this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6311)|

| 1:45:20| prepared. Parents like myself are finding it harder to be understanding, patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6320)|

| 1:45:47| ask like to ask why you are choosing to follow a policy that discriminates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=6347)|

| 1:56:52| thank our supportive board members for their support, and we know as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| that no one on the board or in Knox County schools really does have control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| over this situation. But I'm heartbroken and distraught over the lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| creativity and general thinking outside of the box in our district. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7025)|

| 1:57:29| At the heart of this issue, this isn't about a virus or masks anymore. We saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7049)|

| 1:57:41| offering additional money for universal masking. We know that the Secretary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Education is threatening states like Tennessee for not universal masking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7066)|

| 1:58:29| that smells like crap about all of this, especially with the very public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| comments of elected leaders in our community, along with activists. For me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| I made a promise to my Children never to force them to wear a mask ever again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| and I will not break that promise to them. We cannot ask our Children to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| suspend reality about the effectiveness of masks because obviously, if your mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7123)|

| 2:00:04| to school. I didn't want to wear a mask. Over the weekend, I felt scared. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| nervous and scared to say no to the mask. When KCSN called and canceled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7208)|

| 2:00:16| Once I said no to a mask, I was put in a room with a poster that said, Your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7216)|

| 2:01:49| Hello. My name is Stacy Rowe and I live in Knox County. Thank you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| opportunity to speak here today. We started this meeting with the Pledge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| Allegiance reciting with liberty and justice for all. Liberty is the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| authority on one's way of life, behavior or political views. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| superintendent declared Tuesday, September 26 a success. I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| depends on your definition of success. Thousands of students stayed home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| 722 students were isolated. Your words, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| Synonyms for isolation are alone, seclusion, segregation, separateness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| solitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| Certainly this is not how Knox County defines success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| I see both masks and unmasked faces in this room, but our Children do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| this choice. They can't remove their mask to speak or ask questions so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| they can be heard and understood. They don't have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| Children must wear a mask, even though the very box that contains surgical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| masks says, and I quote, this is a single use product. Please destroy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| after use. Recommended use time is four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| When the mask is no longer tolerated, there will be a tendency to touch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| often, increasing the risk of contact contamination and the risk of inhaling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| viral particles. When the mask is wet, its property decreases. Therefore, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| is less breathable. The W. H. O. Says that masks can be effective if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| don't touch, don't talk, don't speak loudly or sing. If you can avoid not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| being hot or avoid the mask getting wet, which is exactly the opposite of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| what most kids are gonna do. And let's be honest, I've watched all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| adults in here touching your masks all night to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7409)|

| 2:04:40| were isolated and denied their education. If our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| cannot stand up for our liberty, then who can? Is it a question of can't or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| won't? The bottom line is masks are illegal. They were illegal last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=7487)|

| 2:15:12| against people with disabilities. Yet the judge handed down a federal mandate that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| egregiously discriminatory. Now my family knows what discrimination feels like. Leah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8116)|

| 2:16:03| far since the judge's unlawful and unjust mandate, which is in direct violation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8163)|

| 2:16:15| Because she has a disability which the judge does not deem eligible for reasonable accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| even though the law clearly states Leah's disability is eligible for such. Since when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| is a federal judge part of an IEP team decision? In my mind, this is all Judge Greer's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| and that's where I rest my grievances. Where are the checks and balances? With his unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8193)|

| 2:19:11| I've been accused of intimidating kids by walking my own kids up to school carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| a flag. I've had people come up to me and say, why are you intimidating our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| They're afraid to go to school. Meanwhile, as I stand outside with my children, F you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8361)|
| 2:19:30| Go get a job. Who's intimidating who? That's ridiculous that we should be subjected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| that for walking peacefully, saying the Pledge of Allegiance, carrying a flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| At the beginning of the September 9th hearing, Judge Greer lays out the court rules. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| is ridiculous. And he says to everybody, the rule allows everyone to remove their mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| while speaking. And that makes it easier for the court reporter to get a clear record of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| this. The plaintiff's attorney comes up and speaks. COVID can be spread through droplets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| that are coming out of my mouth as I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| So that's why we must have a mask mandate. Do you hear the insanity and how ridiculous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| that is? What about our kids who need to be able to communicate with their teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8413)|
| 2:20:20| Don't they have the same need to communicate with their teachers and vice versa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| Why is it just the judge and the attorneys? Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| I've spoken to several Farragut administrators where my kids are. Every single one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| said it's impossible to enforce this. You know what? Shame on them. You know why? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| sure, every time I hear it, oh, it's the judge's order. Fair enough. But you have control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Mr. Principal, Mr. Bartlett, of controlling your campus. And the hypocrisy, it oozes hypocrisy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8445)|
| 2:20:53| when my kid who comes to the front door and is asked if she's going to wear a mask, honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| says, no, I don't believe in wearing a mask and is sent to isolation like you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| Meanwhile, the rest of the school is not wearing a mask. I have a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| I have a video, one minute video of the Farragut Commons ground. Thirty-eight students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| in this video. Thirty-four of them had no mask on and nobody says anything to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| Shame on you, school. Shame on you. Hypocrisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| And Mr. Bartlett wrote me an email saying that he's sorry that if it seems inconsistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8489)|
| 2:21:37| we're working on that. At this point, I will take just over the mouth. That is contempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8497)|
| 2:21:44| of court and nobody's holding him responsible for it, but our kids that are honest are punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| for it. That has to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| So next we'll have Hannah Taylor. Next we'll have Hannah Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8512)|
| 2:22:03| Next we'll have Kimberly Parks. Kimberly Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8523)|
| 2:22:22| If you state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| Kimberly Parks, Knox County, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| I had like this, my computer's not even booting up. I had this really great speech prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| for y'all, but a lot of the people here have already said everything I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8554)|
| 2:22:44| But one of the things that I don't get is that our children are not affected by COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8564)|
| 2:22:52| They're not. We've had zero deaths here in Knox County. And I had a thing in my speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| that, so influenza in 2018 killed 643 children. Seven of them were in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8579)|
| 2:23:13| COVID-19 in only, well, and that's eight months. Flu season's about eight months, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| And right now, as of yesterday, COVID-19, 21 months in, has killed 637 children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8600)|
| 2:23:31| and zero of them are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| So COVID-19 has killed less, and well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8616)|
| 2:23:45| So the flu, what took the flu eight months to do, it took COVID-19 21 months to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8625)|
| 2:23:53| Let that sink in, guys. That's all I got. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8633)|
| 2:24:03| So next we have Amanda Leak, and then after that, Tina Shields and Elizabeth Chan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8643)|
| 2:24:15| If you'll please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8655)|
| 2:24:28| My name is Amanda Leak. I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| Good evening. Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight for my students and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| I attended last week's meeting, and after statements made that they were happy to see so many compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8680)|
| 2:24:47| and thinking students were largely okay with masks, I knew I needed to speak up for my students and so many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| Students, staff, and teachers had their choice taken away simply because so many were not wearing one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| unlike those that always had a choice to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| We are in this situation due to parents, four students, their lawyers, and one federal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| Why did they get a chance to stay home and do online, and we were not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| That was offered last year. It's not offered this year. That's not fair. It's not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| The burden of those that are for mask choice and autonomy over their bodies is much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| Again, not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Kids, staff, and teachers have been segregated or sent home until they comply. Not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| Those for mask choice are being bullied, threatened, and punished until they comply. Again, not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| My student was told by a staff member in her class that you could be suspended if you were in isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| segregation, for more than two days. Not true, but nobody told the students it wasn't true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8749)|
| 2:25:55| and I haven't heard from the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| What about all the students that want their grades not to suffer for affecting their college future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8757)|
| 2:26:04| They cannot participate or access to in-person learning until they comply. Not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8764)|
| 2:26:12| Not one student, staff, or teacher wanting to mask was ever segregated, sent home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| denied in-person learning, or had to choose not to mask for their extracurricular activities or fear for grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| Not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| I moved here from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| Having my child's education held hostage for an agenda is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| If we do not have a mask choice, we lose autonomy over our bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| and the vaccination mandate for public education is next. It's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| My last school promised to stand up, school board, promised to stand up for parents and students' choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8803)|
| 2:26:52| Then they accepted federal funding with strings attached that took our rights away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| Please tell me I'm not going to see that happen again here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8819)|
| 2:27:08| Until our community changes and learns to love and allow others to live their best life the way they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8828)|
| 2:27:17| I do not see a bright future for us or our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8840)|
| 2:27:34| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| My name is Tina Shields, and I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| I have several points to make, so I'll be brief on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| Number one, Judge Greer's statement that we complied last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| so masks were a reasonable accommodation is what has put us in this situation of being required to resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| We are here today because we didn't push hard enough last year, and it's being used against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8872)|
| 2:27:57| We also know more just how harmful the masks have been to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| Number two, the inconsistency with which schools are handling unmasked children is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| They are getting zero instruction and are not even being allowed to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| let alone help each other on the assigned work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| And mine is lucky to be getting the assigned work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Most schools aren't even doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| My child hasn't been bullied personally, but has witnessed a staff member putting their face inches from other students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| and yelling at them to pull their mask all the way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| Number three, my son with special needs was outed last Tuesday for having autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| a diagnosis he does not have when he was allowed to go maskless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| On Wednesday, when they decided he had to wear one and he refused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| he was sent to isolation with nothing to do and no support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| This is very confusing to him and illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| He barely speaks in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| He is a mouth breather, and the mask gets sucked into his mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| He loves school and his friends, so he has given up his ability to speak in order to be with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| He should never have to make that either-or decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| My other two high school sons want to attend a service academy and serve our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| and protect our rights and freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| In order to do this and maintain the grades they need in their all-honors, AP, and IB curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| they cannot protest and go to isolation, otherwise known as segregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| because they will get zero instruction and be counted absent in every class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| despite being counted president at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| The Air Force Academy will not say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| oh, you got a B because you were standing for your constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| We'll excuse it. That's not how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| So in order to defend us and fight for our rights when they are grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| they are not able to do so now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| There is something inherently wrong in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Number five, while taking my mother to the doctor Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| I was informed by the nurse who I was just chatting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| that their company policy is zero mask exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| So every patient of this huge physician's group has no recourse regardless of their reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| I am happy to see that you are fighting the treating physician requirement for exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| Six, there must be changes to protect all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| All children should be given the same treatment and access to assignments and instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| Teachers and staff who are bullying, shaming, and even forcibly applying masks to children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| and refusing access to education should be dealt with harshly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| and with no question as to what your expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| There should also be zero instruction of any student at any age in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| regarding masks or compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| No writing prompts, coloring pages, songs, discussions, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9026)|
| 2:30:32| Teach them what they need to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| We understand that most of you are fighting for us, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| We need you to continue to stand for our freedom, pursue justice, and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9038)|

| 2:30:56| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| My name is Elizabeth Chan in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| I was born and raised in Hong Kong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| I remember when I was little, my grandparents would share with me the stories of escaping from communism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9064)|
| 2:31:10| They uprooted their families and moved to Hong Kong, which was a British colony at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| in their pursuit of freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| They lost pretty much everything in the process and arrived in a village where refugees lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9077)|
| 2:31:24| after they arrived in Hong Kong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| As the time passed and approaching the time that Hong Kong was going to be handed back to China| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| by the British government, my parents decided to apply for us to move to the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| in our pursuit for continued freedom for our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| The whole process took 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| It was a few months before our big move to the U.S. that the Tiananmen Square protests broke out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9104)|
| 2:31:50| I remember watching the protesters on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| They were calling for democracy, free speech, and free press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| The image that resonated with me the most was this brave individual who stood alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| and blocked several military tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| I was deeply heartbroken to see what was happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| and it made me think about the price people are willing to pay to obtain freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| He has since been known as the Tank Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| We have been blessed with freedom since we moved here, but in recent months, I noticed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| Our freedom has been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| With the latest mandate that came about, we decided that we need to stand up and speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| We are not anti-mask. We are pro-freedom of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| My children chose not to comply with the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| They were denied access to the school building and therefore denied education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9154)|
| 2:32:39| They went without masks again on the second day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| and as far as I know, they were the only two students who did not comply that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| They were denied entry and education again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| In a figurative manner, I saw the image of the Tank Man again in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| except that this time, my kids are the Tank Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| Figuratively, the Tanks are the punishments imposed by the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| with the intention to coerce my kids into submission through the denial of their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| if they do not comply and therefore impact their future negatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| We decided to withdraw them from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| We understand that the mandates on freedom suppressions are happening in many areas in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9195)|
| 2:33:24| As my parents and grandparents were willing to uproot their families to pursue freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9204)|
| 2:33:29| we are willing to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| However, we do not believe there is a better place that we can move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| Therefore, we decide to stand up and defend our freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| and there are many children and families who are doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| I stand here to respectfully request for Knox County School System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| to reconsider the punishments being imposed on the kids who choose to stand up for freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| Children and their parents should not be punished for exercising their freedom of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| and doing what is best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=9233)|

| 2:55:48| and pulled the rug out from under them by ordering an immediate mask mandate. Some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10548)|

| 2:56:06| the fact that the science behind masking is far from settled and that most of these common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10566)|
| 2:56:10| masks state they have either not been tested against COVID-19 or that they are ineffective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10570)|

| 2:56:28| To demand that nearly 70,000 people go back to masking is entirely unreasonable. By the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| way, for a virus as mentioned tonight that according to the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10594)|

| 2:56:47| It would seem that the judge took an axe to a problem that needed a scalpel. There's got to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| better solution to this than a sweeping mandate. Reasonable accommodations are understandable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| but it should never be at the cost of infringing upon the rights of other people. These children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=10619)|

| 3:08:13| not to wear a mask, she takes a daily medication. She has to go to the nurse at 1130 every day. So she goes up and asks the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11293)|
| 3:08:23| ED of her school, can I go take my medicine? And he said no because you don't have a mask on. She said but I have to take my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11303)|
| 3:08:29| medicine. He said if you will take one of these masks and put it on, then you can go take your medicine. Otherwise you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11309)|
| 3:08:37| So she put the mask on and she went and took her medicine. It's the only time she has put a mask on since this starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11317)|
| 3:08:47| Her sister who has an autoimmune disorder which causes severe skin issues because of the mask last year that she did wear has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11327)|
| 3:08:58| permanent scarring on her face. We told our girls we will never make you wear a mask again. And we told them it is your choice and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11338)|
| 3:09:07| don't want to wear this mask at school, we will stand up and support you because this is your choice. This is your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11347)|
| 3:09:15| Last year, you harmed your face because of this. Now, in the isolation room, they have put up paper on every outside window and on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11355)|
| 3:09:29| doors so that nobody can see in and they can't see out. They are not allowed to stand up. They are not allowed to talk. They are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11369)|
| 3:09:37| allowed to help each other. But all the other students, every time the bell rings, they get to walk around for 10 minutes. They get to talk to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11377)|
| 3:09:45| other. They get to use their cell phones. They have social interaction. They are getting no instruction from teachers. So why can't they at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11385)|
| 3:09:53| help each other within this isolation room? I implore you all to put a precedent down for all of these schools of equal treatment of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11393)|
| 3:10:04| children because it is not happening. And what is happening is cruel. It is cruel. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11404)|

| 3:10:37| Parker Bartholomew, Knoxville, Tennessee. You all either must believe that we're just making all this stuff up or it's really happening. If we can assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11437)|
| 3:10:51| for a minute that it's really happening, then you have to do something. I went up to Greenville, Tennessee to the court to get the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11451)|
| 3:11:06| When I walked in the courthouse, you know what Judge Greer wasn't enforcing? A mask mandate. In the courthouse. You all sit here and say you're scared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11466)|
| 3:11:19| because you're going to go to jail. I'll tell you right now. Resign, I'll take your spot, and I'll go to jail. Right now. Any one of you. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11479)|
| 3:11:30| gladly do it. And then I'll immediately go on a hunger strike. That's what we need to be teaching our kids. I have two children in Knox County schools. One at Rocky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11490)|
| 3:11:43| Hill and one at Bearden Middle. Since September 28th, I've had one question that I've tried to get an answer to. I spoke with both principals at the schools, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11503)|
| 3:11:56| secretary for the school board, the secretary for the superintendent, the Ombuds person, and I'm sorry, I probably didn't pronounce that right, and the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11516)|
| 3:12:05| department. In each interaction, I was told that they could not or would not answer me and directed me to somebody else in that chain. For eight days this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11525)|
| 3:12:18| Yesterday, I was told by the Ombuds person that the superintendent would be making an announcement today to answer this one question. Most mentioned that the people in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11538)|
| 3:12:32| meaning the school board, the superintendent, or the law department, could provide an answer. And my one question, and this is not a rhetorical question, will my children or any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11552)|
| 3:12:48| children receive instruction in isolation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11568)|
| 3:13:19| Please let the record show that no one from Knox County schools was willing to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11599)|
| 3:13:34| Your silence on this, there's one word for it, and it's abomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11614)|

| 3:14:06| Naomi Elliott, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| What was he just saying about an abomination, like maybe the abomination of desolation or something? I mean, that's kind of what y'all are doing by not acting, is making our children and our community desolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11650)|
| 3:14:23| Whatever happened to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? You keep hearing how all these children are not only getting their rights infringed on with their education and equality, their constitutional rights, their civil rights, and their human rights, more importantly, and what are we doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11663)|
| 3:14:40| What are y'all doing? The pursuit of happiness, well, dopamine is the happiness chemical, so no wonder there's an increase in anxiety and depression because of this board's activities and inactivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11680)|
| 3:14:53| You're all responsible. I thought the opposite of love was hate. No, I was wrong, because if you trust science, the opposite of love is fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11693)|
| 3:15:02| And all this fear-mongering that happened last year and this year, it needs to stop. Us as human beings are meant to connect with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11702)|
| 3:15:11| Are all of these policies an attack on children and families and human beings and the connections that we have that make us more humanitarian and more compassionate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11711)|
| 3:15:24| And you think, oh, well, it's not hurting them, it's helping them, but you don't know what it's doing to their little brains because you're altering the hormones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11724)|
| 3:15:33| And with all of these policies, we do not consent. And besides all these ADA violations, what about freedom of religion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11733)|
| 3:15:41| We, the people, have had enough. It wasn't right for you to tell me that you think you know what my religious beliefs are better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11741)|
| 3:15:51| And I'll say it again, the last time I checked, it was a subjective matter, not objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11751)|
| 3:15:57| And are we going to keep following the experts who keep profiting off of all this madness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11757)|
| 3:16:02| One of the UT faculty members, his father has been in the human genetical engineering research industry for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11762)|
| 3:16:15| And we get this board of health all made up of mostly UT people. Where are the FBI? They're too busy coming after parents trying to protect their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11775)|
| 3:16:23| They're coming after the Terrants. Love is the best thing, but you know what? Let Terrants fear. Let Terrants fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11783)|
| 3:16:32| Look at some Ronald Reagan quotes. They're really good. I didn't realize what a great speaker he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| But this medical tyranny needs to end. It's a genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| And the Nobel Prize winner last year for 2020, she's involved in genetical engineering too with CRISPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11801)|
| 3:16:48| And she says the future is designer babies and designer humans. So where's the diversity going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11808)|
| 3:16:53| Maybe we can help people with diseases and disabilities. Maybe that's a good motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11813)|
| 3:16:58| A better one than profit and position because of coercion, which is racketeering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11818)|
| 3:17:03| Yeah, look it up. I'll be happy to send you any information I have on these discoveries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211006?start=11823)|
