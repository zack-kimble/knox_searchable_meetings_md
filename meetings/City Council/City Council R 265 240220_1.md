| 2:05:18| for community service for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| part of Knoxville Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| That hotel also won the state-level award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| for community service this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| You all are familiar with RAM, Remote Area Medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| They had their service here in town last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| For the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| when they run their service here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| we host them at our hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| We give them over 100 free room nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| We give them discount, and that's for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| that come to work with the doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| And we give them discounted rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| for the rest of the staff that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| And on Saturday night, we give them one big dinner party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| which they thoroughly enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| And we're trying to link them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| with the Knoxville Hospitality Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| so we can better service the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| So again, we're not really a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| We're part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Our business is there, and we work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| The zoning, RN-5, was designed for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| It's a transition between commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| and office to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| It has critical infrastructure with grocery stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| restaurants, everything right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| Has public transportation, bus stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| And the ground is level, flows downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| We had a neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| with the neighbors at Tower Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| Mr. Tim Allen, who will also speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| is the spokesperson for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| We had over 25 people from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| come into the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| and our councilman was there with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| And it was a very interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| They had some points that we addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| The first point was drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| We're downhill from them, so drainage is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Sewage is a problem for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| We won't contribute to the sewage problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| but there is definitely an infrastructure problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| in that neighborhood with sewage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| that they could use your help on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| Traffic was another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| We were able to address that because of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Tower Heights is right off of Central Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| Coming down Pratt Road is the primary direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| that all traffic will flow out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| If you try to go the other way, especially in rush hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| you're not going to be able to take a left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| to go down to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| And they're very concerned with low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7671)|
| 2:07:58| Where a hotel is, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| this is our first opportunity to try to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| Whatever gets developed in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| it's important to us how it fits into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| because our hotels are in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| So we want to make sure everything goes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| I've got a real estate agent that is helping me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| with the development and looking at the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| We don't have plans yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| so I can't tell you exactly what's going to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| But I can tell you what it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| It will be something that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| will be proud to have next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| is Timothy Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Mr. Allen, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| If you could come up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| Yes, my name is Timothy Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| I'll take my hearing aids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Got a little feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| So my name is Timothy Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| and my address is 121 Karen Drive, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7736)|
| 2:09:03| I've been in the neighborhood for 18 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| and initially, when this project came to my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| we talked as a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| and some of the concerns, like Mr. Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| were the traffic, infrastructure, density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| and, of course, change of neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| When I bought the house 18 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| it was a very quiet neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| and that's one of the reasons why I selected the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| Before I got there, there were infrastructure problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| To the north of the neighborhood is an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| I think it was Steeplechase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| but since then, it's been changed to another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| Sewage, and I think there was sewage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| but you'll have to look at city engineering to check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| One of the biggest concerns the neighbors had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| was with already having some infrastructure problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| a new development might add more problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| and I'm part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| So, as Mr. Smith has already said, too, traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| but we're more than happy to work with Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| as this process continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| I just want to say, overall, that during our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| a lot of questions were answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| some not answered, like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| He's not exactly sure what he's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| but I have full confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| that it'll be a benefit to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| So, the neighborhood, Tower Heights community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| would like to support this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Thank you, Mr. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Next person signing up to speak is Girish Desai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7847)|
| 2:10:54| Is he present? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| That is the last person to sign up on this item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| Is there a motion on the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Any questions or discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| I have some brief...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Yes, I have some brief comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| This was a good experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| as far as the neighborhoods working with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| You know, you see the jump from an RM1 to an RM5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| which, you know, we always scrutinize those heavily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| but it's all about the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| and that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And this particular development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| kind of checks a lot of the boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| about where to build new housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| It's close to an artery, which is Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| The traffic, actually, from this new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| will not go into the neighborhoods hardly at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| Most of it's going to go out on the Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| And for the benefit of the future residents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| which is what we all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| which is what we always look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| is they will have easy access to public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7926)|

| 2:12:22| will be relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240220?start=7942)|
