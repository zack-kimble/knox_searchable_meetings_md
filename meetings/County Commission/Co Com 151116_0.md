| 0:02:01| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| There are only two items before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| One is a deferred application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| Madam Clerk, will you read the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| The pavilion at Hunter Valley Farm, LLC, the pavilion at Hunter Valley Farm, LLC, 9133 Hunter Valley Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=131)|
| 0:02:19| on and off premises, District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| I am here on behalf of the applicant, and I think I'm going to ask that this be deferred to the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| When this was postponed, I believe, at the August meeting, I told my client to be back on the fourth Monday in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=160)|
| 0:02:49| and she planned to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| But it was my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| I forgot that it had been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I would like to, at least at this point, amend verbally our application to on-premise only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=178)|
| 0:03:08| and state that since the August meeting, which I believe was when we were here last, we have met with the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=188)|
| 0:03:18| which was the siting authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| And I think all of our --I'll let the ABC speak for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| but the last time I talked to the head of the enforcement division here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| we had understanding, our client and the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Our client understood exactly what she could and couldn't do and has been operating that way ever since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=213)|
| 0:03:42| So I guess if I can, I would like to ask that this be deferred to the December meeting, which will be December 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| and I have told her to be here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| I think we've had all our inspections except for the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| We're trying to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| And the health department is coming sometime before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| One question before I make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| I'm using it pretty loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Do we need to vote on the changing of this, or is that just simple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| If there be no objection, I will accept his verbal amendment and defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| If there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| That was the motion I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| And if you want me to, I can explain what we've worked out with the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| If you're not interested in that, I'll save it until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| But I think it's the way we're proposed to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Commissioner McKenzie, do you wish to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| No, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I'm assuming that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| But I'll, I mean, to your comment, you'll probably end up having to explain it to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| We'll probably have a lot of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| If not, we have a motion and properly seconded to accept the verbal amendment to be only on premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=318)|
| 0:05:28| and to be heard at the next regular meeting of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| If there be no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=340)|

| 0:12:08| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| This being in the 8th District and also a location that is currently has a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| which must be surrendered before you can get the new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| So there's currently sales going on there and a valid permit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| which will have to be surrendered before a new permit can be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| And also it's pending inspection for the Health Department and pending certification of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| I make a motion that the permit for NPR retail for off-premise beer be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=763)|
| 0:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Young Mr. Patel, you said you'd had the server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Has your father done the server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| No, sir, because I'll be operating the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| He's just the guy that owns the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| So you're going to be the sole salesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Yes, sir, and I'll be the head manager up there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And the sole salesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Could you define that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Anybody else working for you there going to be selling beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| Yes, sir, the employee right now, they're working currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Do they have their permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Yes, sir, because they're working right there currently because the business is still operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| If not, we have motion properly before us for the sale of off-premise beer by NPR retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=834)|

| 0:14:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| See the young lady right back there, Mr. Patel, and she'll give you a package that can help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=845)|
| 0:14:13| Mr. Patel, your father and owner will have to have the server training program within 30 days of the issuance of the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=853)|
| 0:14:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| You understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| You need to translate that to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| You'll have to bring a copy of the certification to the clerk's office once you've completed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Now, since this meeting has been short, we're going to have at this time public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| Do you want to have this, Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Is there anyone that would wish to speak to the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| Captain Alan Wolfie May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Last month we were kind of in between on the sale of beer and liquor in ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=909)|
| 0:15:21| I'm going to try to straighten it out a little bit, maybe plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| If the Knox County Sheriff's Office does a beer sting and we buy two Bud Lights and they have a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| even though ABC isn't with us, they will go in and they'll do an administrative fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| So it doesn't, the liquor doesn't have anything to do with the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=942)|
| 0:15:51| And it's two separate instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| Part of it is the fact that they do the liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| They sign that if they get caught under a sale, then even if it's a different agency, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| which would be me as the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| So I just want to make everyone understand that if I do a beer sting and they have a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| we don't have that many in Knox County that do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| but they will pull my citations and write them an administrative citation for whatever fine that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=983)|
| 0:16:38| Anyone have any questions about my explanation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| Are there questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| That fine is the same exact fine equivalent to what they would have been given had ABC been the one that did the sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1009)|
| 0:17:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| ABC does their own, has their own fine system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| It's a little bit different than what your all's is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| So you're saying that they are not getting double fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| They will receive that fine if they have a liquor license anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Yeah, they are going to be double fined, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| They're going to get that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| If you all fine them for the beer sales, ABC's going to pull my citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| and they're going to fine them also, even though they weren't with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| but that's part of their having a liquor license, a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Commissioner McKenzie had his mic down first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| This is probably just not necessarily for Wolfie, but for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| I mean, you know, I think we need to consider that then, one in our lines of questioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| and what do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| You know, I was, you know, a big proponent on kind of doubling the fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| but if we're, and it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| I know having a liquor license, there's responsibility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| as well as having a beer license, but if our intent is to get their attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| I don't know if $2,000 would be, or I don't know what the dollar amount would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| That may get into cross-lining the more punitive than we really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| So when the first one of these comes up, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Hopefully it won't come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Hopefully people will comply with the law, but just, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| this is just for kind of consideration, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| That's getting steep, a thousand steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| We're talking about more than a thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| That's, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Excuse me, but didn't the ABC guy tell us last month their minimum was $1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| Yeah, so I don't know what they are, but it's, yeah, $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| So that may be something for us to just kind of chew on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Wolfie, if ABC does it, the state does it, Esteem, would we get notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| and would they get a fine from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I mean, since it works the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| If ABC does an undercover without Noss County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| and they, last month they came in with a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| They would charge in Sessions Court, just like I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| and then they would come before you all as far as the beer board that they bought beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| at a Noss County business that had a Noss County beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1182)|
| 0:19:51| A double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I mean, I think this stems, I mean, I'm confident in what I voted last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| because I feel like you're double fining somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| If we do it and then the state's doing it, it's almost a double, it's a double fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| If they do it by themselves, then, of course, we don't, we bring them in front of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| The state does, but as far as Noss County Sheriff's Office, we don't participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| If we do a joint effort, then the place that has a liquor license will get fined by ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| and the Noss County beer board will take care of whatever the beer sales are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| So, I mean, we could, we essentially could, they could be charged $1,500 plus our $1,000, $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I think there starts out at $1,500 and there's, I think, doubles each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| We go back three years and anything over three years, that counts as the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| There's, from the time they get a liquor license, it just keeps doubling every time they do some alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| I think Brad was on before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| He turned his off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Then he turned it back on, so you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| He fell out of queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Sorry, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| If ABC buys a beer, it gets reported to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| If they buy a liquor drink, does it also get reported?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| Yes, if they, they can buy beer and charge a place that has a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| They normally, that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| But, I mean, if they buy a liquor drink, does it still come to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| We don't have any jurisdiction over liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Just beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| They have to buy beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| They have to buy beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| To present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| To present to this board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Have you noticed an improvement in the ratio of sales to minor since we started initiating these higher fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1327)|
| 0:22:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| There are a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| I think it's got the business owners' attention that if you hire an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| you need to hire someone that, if you're not there, that will take care of the business and not sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| Some of you have been on the board for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| You know that we used to do $500 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| And in 15 years, I don't think we ever had anybody take the 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| They all paid the $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| One time in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| He was closing down for the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| When he said, I don't want any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I'm not into double-fining people either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| But when you hold two separate licenses, you have two separate sets of responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| So, you know, you've also got two different sets of profit margins there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Two different sets of profit modes that you're using, beer and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I mean liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| I say if it's working, let's just keep with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| A quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| It's just so I'm perfectly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| If they find somebody or let's say they have beer or whatever and we hear about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| and we fine them or we offer them a suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and do they always fine or do they offer a suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Are there options or do they sometimes waive their fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Or is it like if they write somebody up, they're getting fined, period, and that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| It's kind of hard for me to speak for ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| If they conduct a sting and people have a liquor license and they buy beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| then it's usually a $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| That's their bottom fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| If they have employees that maybe not have taken the alcohol class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| they can go to Nashville, the business can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| and try to show ways of improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| And I think that sometimes they can reduce the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| after maybe they've been caught two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| They'll work their way back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Do they ever waive or give them the option of suspending their license for 30 days like we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| I'm not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| The question I have is we have a law here in the county about selling a beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| The state has a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I think it's behooving to us to go ahead and honor that law that's given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| We also up the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| I don't understand the conversation of why we're double fining people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Because you have two laws, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Well, they have jurisdiction over alcohol and I forget what they call the upper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| what do they call it, heavy beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| What do they call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| High-gravity beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| They have jurisdiction over beer of a certain percentage of alcohol down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| I don't think they have jurisdiction over both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| So I'm not sure where this comes from is really in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| I'd have to do some research on it, Wolfie, to see where they have the jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| over the lower alcohol beer, which is your jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and we have no jurisdiction over the higher alcohol content drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| I just have to look into that because I'm not sure they both apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| I think one of them is TCA-driven and one of them is administrative division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| It's an administrative fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| And so ours is TCA-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Theirs is administratively by the commission's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| I may be totally wrong, but I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I don't know where they have that authority without the state giving them the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| to regulate the beer, which you all have the authority to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I'd have to look through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| I just don't know the answer either right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| So my point here is we have a law to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| We have a law to fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| The state has a law that they have to uphold and fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| So it is not the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| It's two separate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I don't even understand why we're doing the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| We have the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| There's just one law as it relates to the beer we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| The question is do they have jurisdiction to write citations under the beer we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| I don't know the answer to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| They have jurisdiction over high-gravity beer and high-alcohol content liquor type stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| which they have a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| There's two separate laws, and they don't attach to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| So if they come down here with beer beer, meaning the non-high-gravity beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| in your jurisdiction, I'm not sure, Wolfie, where that fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| I know when you bring it in here, and I'm not sure how their office would apply to our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1676)|
| 0:28:04| They've done it twice in the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I know they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Last time we didn't have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Well, they think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah, and that doesn't make it right that they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| I understand, and I agree if they had authority, but, you know, we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| there can only be one authority, okay, if it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| and the whole point of high-gravity is as higher alcohol content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| So above a certain alcohol content, it's the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Below that, it's considered beer, whether it's a wine cooler or whatever, and it's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| So I think this conversation is a good conversation to be having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| You know, and it's, in my mind, the only reason I was saying back off of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| because the whole double fining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I don't think we view this as a revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| We're not trying to make money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| You know, I think we have to be good stewards of our taxes and our fines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| So if the state's insistent, and I thank the law director for taking a look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| if it's ours, then by all means, I think we need to fine the $1,000 or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| because that's been very effective, but to tax someone $2,500 when it's not a separate license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| You've got a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| That's why they call it a liquor license, and you've got a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| They're separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| For beer, if the state's going to come in and steal our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| then I don't think we need to tax it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| That's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| And so for the business owner's sake, you know, I think we've been firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| I don't want to be harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| That's kind of the difference, and I think this seems harsh to me, $2,500 for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| Not for beer and liquor, but for beer at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| So if they went in the pilot and did it, it's $1,000 for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| So that's, hopefully this will get worked out, and we can, but if the state's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| and I know Brad knows a lot more than I, if this is an administrative interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| or administrative view on it, then I think we'll have an argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| but if it comes back as being still state run, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| it goes against small, I mean, local governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| And Randy says he's torn up over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| That light's just flashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| I'm starting to get a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| But he fell out of queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| He just never turns it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| He caught the tater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| Sandy mentioned about being harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| I spent the last seven years plus on the Metropolitan Drug Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| as a Knox County Commission representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| When you look at the statistics that we get on teenage drinking and drugs and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| I don't consider this harsh at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I consider it being good stewards of our youth of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| because the more we can keep this out of their hands, the safer your kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| and my grandkids are going to be out on the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| And that's the bottom line, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| All you've got to do is look at some of these statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I agree with Commissioner Brown 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| You know, a lot of times the county and the state, ABC, will do a joint sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| and they'll go in, they'll buy one liquor drink and one beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| And that's $2,500 right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| I wonder why ABC is buying beer in places that have liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| Why are they not checking for liquor when they go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| We have a law, whether it's administrative or TCA backed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| that they can purchase beer in a business that sells liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Very seldom do we buy mixed drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| ABC very seldom buys mixed drinks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| On the operations that I've been involved in, most of the time it's going to be alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| as far as beer goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| You know, I guess if I follow Commissioner Brown's logic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| it plays well to the media, then we should be charging $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| If this is about the kids and it's about that, we should be charging $2,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| for everybody that comes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| That's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We heard law enforcement say, when asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| doubling the fines has proven effective to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| I mean, it's how much is enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| That's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I want to be very, very punitive, but harsh means undue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| That's why I chose the word harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| I think $2,500 for sale of a beer, when everywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| besides a place that holds two, is $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| 250% more is rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2020)|
| 0:33:53| Going back to my question, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| we have a law that we are talking about in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| that we all agreed to raise the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and the law says if they break it, the first offense we do is $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| That's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| The state has a law, and they can go in and fine two if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| but we're upholding our end of the law in this county, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| We can't be a judge up here and say, okay, now we're going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Well, the state fined $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| We're just going to fine them $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We've set a precedence. Let's hold to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Let's do what we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| We are, I hope, holding up the law itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Whether it's harsh or punitive or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| that's the way we did it a while ago without taking any other things in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| when we raised the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| We all voted on it. This is the fines we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| This is what we should do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Whether it's alcohol or whether it's hard liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I mean, if it's beer, whether it's hard liquor, it's all alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| And your primary constraints come from the state, which is as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| Then we come down to the local level, which we control the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| But beer is still alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| So that's like saying, who am I going to get arrested by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| A state trooper, a county detective, or a city policeman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| You're still arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I think that it is two different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| because that child or that kid that's underage that bought the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| where they also serve mixed drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| you don't know how many times that server has served a kid a mixed drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| of much higher alcohol content and put someone's life in jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| because it is much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| But I would like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Wolfie, what would you like for us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| It's been working the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| You all did what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| And if ABC comes behind me and finds or does whatever they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| it's separate from what we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| It's just like the more policemen we have on the beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| You want my light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I called on you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Just lean it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| The more policemen you have on the beat, the safer your neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| So I would be appreciative if you and ABC went out every time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, hey, like I say, the more the merrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| And the more eyes on the problem, the better a solution you can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| It's proven that this has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| by less folks having to come up here under adverse circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| than if it works, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| And I think with that, what we have to take away from this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Captain Mays, when you present to us underage consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| excuse me, purchases, you don't consume it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| I know it's sitting in the storage locker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| When you have made underage purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| you bring that to us like you've done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| and we'll be okay with that as we have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| I will oppose the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2270)|

| 0:38:42| First order of business today is public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| and I'd like to recognize the Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| And all the Friends of the, well, we'd all have to come down, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| No. Thank you, Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Name and address for recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I'm Lillian Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I'm the advocacy chair for Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| I want to thank you all for all your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| and hope you all will enjoy all the goodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| There is fruit, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| So you don't have to just drink calories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| I'd like to introduce the president of our board of directors, Claire Sorrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2355)|
| 0:39:28| Short and sweet, like the desserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Okay. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| My name is Claire Sorrell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| and I'm the president of the Friends of the Knox County Public Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| I hope you'll review the handout that you've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| entitled Everyday Talking Points about Friends and the Library System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| It contains some interesting facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| about how your support of our library system is invaluable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| and what it is that Friends does to additionally support our library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| So I'd like to start off by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| thank you for supporting our libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| and I hope you'll enjoy the desserts provided by Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| We're actually here to bring you something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| rather than ask you for something today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| I'm sometimes asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| why do you volunteer with Friends of the Library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| And my answer is a fairly simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| I volunteer to pass on the value of libraries and librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| to future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| Perhaps a glimpse into my own life will explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I spent my early childhood abroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| and moved to the States in 1957 when I was eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Please don't do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I was enrolled in an excellent elementary public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| but it had a very small library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| In fifth grade, the teacher assigned us a book report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| and it had to be on a biography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| So I looked around at the school library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and I couldn't find anything that really motivated me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| or that I was even interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| So the school librarian said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| why don't you go down to the town library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I'd never ever been in a public library before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| So my dad graciously accompanied me down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| helped me push open those big doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| and there was a nice lady sitting behind the desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| who asked if she could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| introduce herself as Miss Nancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Well, I told her what my mission or book report assignment was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| and so she took me over to the children's room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| and showed me where the biography section was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| My dad went over to the adult reading room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| where he probably was reading newspapers or catching a nap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| So I walked into the children's section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and I was awed by the number of books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Shelves upon shelves of pristine books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| in that crackly see-through plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| How could I choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Miss Nancy said I could take some over to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and then decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| And just to leave them there on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| so other people could avail themselves of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| and that they would be reshelved in their proper place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| when I was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I pulled out a few and took them over to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| and took note of the silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| To this day I occasionally tiptoe through the stacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| of any library that I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| There was one book, Cheaper by the Dozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| by Frank and Ernestine Carey which captivated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I'd found the book for my report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| so I began reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| About half an hour later Miss Nancy came over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| I think to check to see what and how I was doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| and I did leave children who were fairly well behaved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| unsupervised in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| When I told Miss Nancy that I was trying to finish the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| before the library closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| she explained to me that I could borrow it and take it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I was overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| She escorted me to my father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| and together we filled out a library card application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| at the front desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| And gave me the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Miss Nancy informed me that I had to take good care of the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| because other children might want to borrow it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I felt so grown up because my signature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| was my promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| that I would take care of this wonderful book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| that would be shared with other children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Since then I've visited any number of libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Some are not so quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| Some are so well stocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Some have so many materials that one has to request a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| either on a piece of paper or on a computer terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and the book is brought to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| In high school and college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| I volunteered to shelve and process new books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| So getting back to the original question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| why do you commit time and energy to friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| of the Knox County Public Library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| The answer is both rational and romantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I love libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| And I'm not a nerd really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| In my adult life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| I've supported what I believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| and I believe in libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I know that you all also believe in libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| for the betterment of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| My sincere thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| I have a question for you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Are you keeping Jeanne Idell busy down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Jeanne Idell is one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| that Friends is in being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Jeanne Idell not only stays busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| but she keeps the rest of us busy and organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Did she tell me 22 or 23 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| I just brought her a truckload up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| about three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Well thank you kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Yes Jeanne is an exceptional lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| I just want to first thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| for the wonderful fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| I did partake of the sweets as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| so a few more pounds won't kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| The libraries are wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and I enjoy reading a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| I'm glad that you all volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| and help out because I think it's a wonderful thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| and thank you for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And I would also like to add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| the libraries that lie actually out in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| of which I'm familiar with Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Mascot and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| The most important thing they do during the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| is to come up with a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| to encourage kids during the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| to come to the library and participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and I thank the library for having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| that kind of summer program to benefit the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Also I'd like to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| to all the sweets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2793)|

| 0:47:28| That is the Library Foundation's campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2848)|

| 0:47:34| dare speak for Jenna Mashburn on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2854)|

| 0:47:40| to accomplishing that feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you. You all do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=2866)|

| 0:50:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| and to the republic for which it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| one nation under God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| indivisible with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I'd like your motion for the approval of the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| Motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Opposed no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| We're now down to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Are there additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| Deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I called in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| was asking for a couple just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| clarification for some things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| One of them was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| R1511-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3100)|
| 0:51:53| At this time let me make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| The schools has on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| consent calendar items 201| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| to 222| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| and they will remain on the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Actually it's a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| large number because I was thinking about this earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| adding up those 22 items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| it's $3,595,618.89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| It's a total of those 22 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| If you would have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| of Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| I'll entertain that question right now but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| these items will be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I understand that. I just wanted some clarification from the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| on some of these items that are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3164)|
| 0:52:52| We can talk about them. Do you want me to give all the ones I would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| We're going to talk about it right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| because we're not going to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| in the meeting here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Would someone from the Board of Education please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| approach the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| Does it not have to be pulled before we can discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| We're still trying to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Good evening. Elizabeth Alves, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And your conversation, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Item number 201| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| here. I see the expense here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| and it talks about the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| with the Space Administration Education Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| There was a thing on here that says it's $23,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| plus any additional potential cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Was there any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| what these potential costs, how much that could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| So I believe this will be our third year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| participating in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| There have not been additional costs in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| other than last year we actually had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| two groups of students whose projects were selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| to go up in the shuttle and those students did travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| to the Space Center to view that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| space launch. So those were the only additional costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| that were incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| It doesn't give a dollar amount, that's all I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| So we don't know exactly what those expenses could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| No, we don't at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| But we don't anticipate there being anything significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| That's fine. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Did you have others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| I was wondering, one other thing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| we have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I'll find that out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| Let me look at my others here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3300)|
| 0:55:10| I wasn't here at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| and wanted to get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| It has to do with item number 15-11-219| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| with the Munis Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| for the school system for payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| And the question, I see the expenses here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| and I was wondering, does the county not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| in working right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3340)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| Excuse me, I thought Mr. Caldwell was coming to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| Bob Thomas, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| I was seeing this expense right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| and I thought the county was already on the Munis program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Is there a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| why we're going to have two separate Munis programs here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Chris can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| Their financial system is on Munis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| It's different from the platform and the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| So we use it from a county ERP standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| So that's finance and HR and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| So the schools have a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| payroll system than the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| So they will use it for their payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| We do use it for the county payroll, but it's two separate systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Two separate systems. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| So really they're not the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| No, separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| Further questions? Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| This was just for my own view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| This is item number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| 15-11-220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| It has to do with the fast printers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| I've heard a lot of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| from the teachers about not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| enough paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| for their own personal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| that they have to buy for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I guess paper to print off textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| or tests and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| And we're spending a lot of money on this fast printer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| I was wondering, are we going to be able to supply them with paper this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Commissioner, we have factored that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| We've looked at the usage for the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| and we've factored that into our calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| What we're hoping is that we can do a better job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| distribution with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| high-speed copies of printers and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| and that we can actually save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| We spent, I think it was around $2.4 million last year on copiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| and click charges and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| So we're hoping to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| One way we're looking at saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| all of these printers will do color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| is doing black and white because there's a considerable difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| price-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| So we factored in a copy of having enough paper for the teachers to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| We have, and I'd be glad if you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| specific instances that maybe you and I could talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| I'd certainly be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| That's fine. I just wanted to make sure that that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And that's all I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| I first want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| applaud you for keeping these on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| I think consent needs to mean something and it sounded like they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| With that, I still think that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| probably a little bit out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| but this is probably an iterative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| But it's amazing that all those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| were discussed in pretty deep detail last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| So that those three particular items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| came off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I'd say to all of us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| we have a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| That's what it is. It's a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| That's when we said we'd open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| The school board would be willing to answer any questions as it probably will anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| But that's our time to kind of have these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| and we actually got a lot more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| last week than we did this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| So I'd encourage you, Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| if you go back and look at the tapes on CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| or on the website, you'll get a lot more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| in these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Commissioner Busler, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| To go back on this, I was unable to be here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| I like to talk to people personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| and up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| and make sure that if there's any questions that need to be answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| there's people there that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| And like I said, I was not here. I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| That was my first meeting that I've missed in a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| But I thought that we could at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| discuss anything on the agenda, even if it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| And, Mr. Law Director, I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| I was not out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| We have discussed it, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| We have a couple of diverging trails here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| We can discuss anything at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| And like I said, we've had that discussion before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| and I just wanted to make sure I was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| I just had a question about another consent item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| number 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| When will that take effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| It's on page probably 13 or 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Do you wish to pull 903?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| No, I'm just asking when it takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Fifteen days after the passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| I'll ask the Law Director then to define the word consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| or consent and then consider agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| Because as we said, we have to pull that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| but we're discussing the other ones and we're not pulling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So could you define what the term consent agenda means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| Well, in your rules you set up a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| which means it will not be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| It's already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| It passes by unanimous consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| You also have an agreement on the school ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| that once they're placed on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| they cannot be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Your usual rule is if you discuss something that's on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| you pull it from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| That's where the impetus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| of the school's discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| usually takes place in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| The only ones that do not have to be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| are those that have matching funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| or stuff that are exempt from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| that have to be voted on independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| They're all your rules except for the statutory or judicial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| However you all, you can suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| The game's your game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| So I'm not getting in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| No, and I agree, but I think the process needs to be held true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| So if we're going to suspend the rules, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Let's say we're going to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| We're going to pull things off consent and we just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| But to say that we have a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| and we're going to pull things off or questioning things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| and continuing on with the conversation I think is disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Mr. Law Director, you said a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| that once it's on a consent agenda it couldn't be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I was talking specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| about a particular group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| that had an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| that once they were placed on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| school board consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| they couldn't be removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| That is a judicial agreement that has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Other items can be pulled off consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| at any time at the will of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| During a workshop, before you sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| you generally don't put them on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Once they're voted, if they're voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| to where they qualify to be on consent, then they go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| If they never go on consent, then they stay live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| whether it's a school or whether it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| So it's all about how you all manage by your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| how you manage by your intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| how you establish and set your agenda, what you're doing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| as to whether or not and at what point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| they're put on consent is at the pleasure of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| under the amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Well, I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| I understand where you're coming from, but I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| You know, things move pretty fast today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| and a week is a long time sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| It's a short time sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Things can come up in a week between workshop and regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| New information comes to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| As long as we have an out to where we can go back if we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| as Sam says, suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| But to take away the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| to go back and take a second look at something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I'm not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| As we look at the first 22 items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| they will be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| and cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Currently, as voted on out of the workshop, they're on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| Therefore, under the consent agreement, they cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| They can be discussed if you put them on a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| as an amendment to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| but you can't vote on them or you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I mean, they have to pass by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| That's what the agreement actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Prior to that, you know, for the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| before you set your agenda, you can do anything you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| So, as just said by the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| before we establish the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| we can do pretty much whatever we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| which in the circumstance this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Commissioner Bussler's three questions were asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| If we were to add these as discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| they would be later on this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| and discussed after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| So I believe the process by which we're moving through right at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| probably best suits the needs of everyone seated here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Exactly. It's going to be later on in the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| So do we need to rework our agenda to say somewhere in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| before we approve, before we have the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| or during the amendments to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| that there's a discussion period for any items that might be on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| No, we do not need to change the rules unless the Rules Committee wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| But that's what we're going to have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I want to know we got that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| That was totally up to Commissioner Bussler to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| Are there other additions, deletions, or deferrals for tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| You didn't answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| So you're saying that we can have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| if we have a need to, we can have discussion on a consent item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| before we set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I did not say that. The law director said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| And I don't think the law director said that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| No. What happens is in your process in the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| before you establish the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| there is no consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| At that time, you set a consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| and you have things yet to be put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Those things you discuss and you vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Generally, under your rule, if they are voted on 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| then they go to consent for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| At that time, all non-school items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| that are on consent can be pulled off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| and discussed at a later date, later time in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| Otherwise, they remain on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| If you had a school item that you wanted to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| it cannot be pulled off of consent. It would stay on the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| You would have to put it as a discussion item at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| and the discussion could inform you, but the vote would already be taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| and any action would be moot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| but you could gain whatever knowledge you wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| That's what I was talking about, about discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| That only applies to the school things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| The schools, by our consent agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| judiciary, once it's put on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| we have agreed as a body, you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| that it cannot be pulled off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| but it is not on consent until you set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| the consent agenda in your workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| or by your rule when you vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| and it becomes a unanimous vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| whatever it is, then it usually goes on consent by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| At this point, everything that is on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| for schools remains on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Anything else that is on consent, you have the discretion to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| before you set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| If you pull it, then you discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| If you leave it, it stays on consent and you vote on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| Well, the bottom line is you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| to discuss school items at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| once you vote on them, they're on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| End of that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Everything else is up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| You can pull it when you want to, talk about it when you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| vote on it when you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Leave it on consent or take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| I hope that we follow that and it really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Pulling it, putting it at the end of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| doesn't hurt us in any way either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| because all we can do is discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| If these items don't have a fiduciary note attached to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| that we have say in, then we're going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| We've got to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| So the vote is really just a formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| So us discussing it, whether it's at 5 o'clock or at 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| And hopefully going forward we can follow this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Commissioner McKenzie, you used the word discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| What I think Commissioner Bussler had was questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| and his questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| I was wondering if we could go ahead and move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| We haven't even started this meeting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| I'd like to add a discussion at the end of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| for us to talk about possibly having a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| so that we can talk about this during our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| instead of these people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| The discussion item will be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| because we are in the process of setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| I just wanted to apologize if I caused any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I was not here during the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| but I do appreciate the rest of the board here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| letting me talk about certain items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| Are there other items to be added, deferred, or deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Do I hear a motion that the agenda is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Madam Clerk, are there roads and drives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| There's a motion. You need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We've got to have a motion for all those, then, that need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Deferred. Deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| And withdrawn. Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Commissioner Owen being Commissioner Schooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Still need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| We have set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| I'm reading two lines down the page too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| There are no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| Are there line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| There are no line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| There are 123 notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Do I hear a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Motion is properly before us to approve notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| This is consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| You've got to read the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Oh, you're going to read consent first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| You can read the first item on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=4419)|

| 1:29:05| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| I need to pause there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| We do not have a discussion item on tonight's agenda concerning the placement of the next member to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5349)|
| 1:29:25| I would like to ask Dr. Chris Caldwell if there is an update on the process of receiving names to be added to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5365)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| We sent out to the TSCPA the notice that Dr. Corsillo had resigned from the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5392)|
| 1:30:01| and they were going to put it in their publication newsletter, which would come out probably in the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5401)|
| 1:30:10| And I think we have 90 days to let them respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| I think it's 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| And then if they don't respond with any candidates, then we can proceed without one of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| But I'm sure there will be some candidates respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5428)|

| 1:30:37| Discussion regarding the Knox County Legislative Joint Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| As you're aware, there is going to be a joint meeting of the Knox County Legislative Delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| that is being set up by State Representative Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| It will include all the members of the Board of Education, all the members of the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| The format, as we get ready to prepare an agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| was proposed to have two 15-minute segments of discussion related to concerns of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5469)|
| 1:31:20| and two 15-minute segments related to the discussion of items of concern to Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| That's the reason this has been added as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| And who wants to say something first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| We have had several items talked about at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| but we need to sort of narrow down on the couple that we need to be ready to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| or bring our concerns to the State Delegation, the legislative body of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5510)|
| 1:31:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| There's a lot of broad-based issues that I'm sure a lot of local governments will pass on to their legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| to take to the State, such as the opiate, heroin, mental health issues, roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| I think we need to be real defined here and look for specific things that are unique to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| that we want them to take to the State and push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| And as I discussed last weekend, the results from our Joint Education Committee School Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| if we have to really put a fine point on one thing, it is the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5561)|
| 1:32:49| Like I said, we received the talk last month from Dr. Fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| and if somehow we can craft with the school board a letter or a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| that kind of gets at what our issue is with the way we're funded currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| we can't go and say we want BEP 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| We understand that that won't pass, but there are certain aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| and that's something that we can try to get them to push for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| I think it would be a great thing as far as education goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Going along with what Sam said, I think obviously the surplus is one-time money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| but I think some of that surplus, it would be wise to take surplus or a lottery surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| and invest capital for local school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| I think that would assist with technology or capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| It would be a big asset for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| It kind of defers some of the things we're going to have to end up paying for later anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| The discussion of BEP seems to have been clouded anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5633)|
| 1:34:02| Reading the media of the day, all the recommendations that have been made in the past may have been erased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5642)|
| 1:34:12| I think we still need to try to focus on what would be our two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| I agree that the small education committee might be looking at something that we can agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| with the Board of Education on, but whether it's our item or their item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5663)|
| 1:34:31| it would still be just one 15-minute segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Do you want to expand any on what you were saying there, Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Well, I think with it taking up 63 percent of our budget, it is kind of our item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| And so moving forward, we've got two schools that are fixing to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| and a desired elementary school that we would like to see come to fruition, technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| It's not cheap to place technology in these classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| and so I think it's important that with the low BEP turnover, I think it's important that the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| if they've got some one-time money, that would be a great use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| So I think if we could get with our delegation and get behind that, I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| I mean, there's other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| I mean, roads, state road projects need to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| That could be done with that one-time state money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| But I think it really all comes down to them not putting on us costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| deferring costs to us and some of that stuff they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| They said they're going to keep all the mental health money in the East Tennessee region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| and the problem hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| It's only increased with Lakeshore closing as far as getting treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| And so while I agree that closing Lakeshore may be more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| but the money is not exactly staying here and becoming forefront for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| And so those are some of the things that we need to discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| You know, we have a work session the Monday before that meeting on the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| so I hope that we could possibly add discussion to that meeting as well so it's fresh on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| But one thing that comes to mind, a lot of us attended the Metropolitan Drug Commission's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| and they felt like one of the items was about these prescription drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| and how the state's going to regulate how the opiates and other things are prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| And I think we need to really – that's one of the things I think is really important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| We have a huge drug problem in this state of prescription drugs that we've got to make sure we handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| And we have that problem right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| I think you're right, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I think it's the drugs, the pain pill problem, and also the mental health problem in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| You know, the sheriff is talking, has been before this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| talking about expanding the facilities that he has available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| And right now we're treating mental health in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| And this is something that is more statewide than it is a local problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| This is not something that we can pass a budget to take care of, and that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| We're trying to plug that hole when the state needs to step in and help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| and build a facility here to take care of these residents that are being ill-treated right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| And it's ill-treatment to take someone with mental health and put them in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| And then spend hundreds of dollars a day to buy them medicine, whether or not they take it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| And then you let them out, and it's the same revolving door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| There has to be an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| And this is something that would make our schools better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| It would make our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| It would help everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| And at the same time, we are, of course, working, as Bob said, on this opiate problem, opium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| It's just wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| It's unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| And the sheriff has told us that that's the number one problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| The number one reason for crimes in Knox County is pain pills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| people stealing something to get the money to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| And until we really wake up and face that, it's not going to get any better at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| I agree with Brad and Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| Mental health is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Closing Lakeshore, yeah, it saved the state $22 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| but we haven't seen that money flow back to here to take care of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| Now we've got mentally ill in our jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| We've got over 400 inmates-plus that are mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| We're treating them out there, like Commissioner Brantley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| that it's turned into a mental hospital out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| And we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| The safety center, I think, is the right path to go, that we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| But we've got to think more regional, and we need to get the state to help fund this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| and not just operational costs, but maybe to build the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| Because mental health, I mean, they're out on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Their homeless population has increased because of mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| and we need to have more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| I think that's one of the items that really needs to be on our list that we discuss with legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| because mental illness is not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| It's just going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Again, these are very broad strokes that every municipality in the state of Tennessee is facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5981)|
| 1:39:49| I want to get a little bit more targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| While I'm not completely sold on a safety center, I believe the majority of this commission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| So why don't we try an approach of asking for the state, our legislators to go to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| and try to set up a pilot program here that we can implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| I'll go on with what Commissioner Smith just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| Every month we get a jail report, inmate report daily for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6019)|
| 1:40:29| The beginning of the month, the end of the month, they're down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| because they want to try to comply with federal regs, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| and probably some left out on the street that maybe shouldn't be left out on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| or let out on the street, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| But you look at the mid-month figures on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Look at the mid-months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Sometimes it's 150, 200 more than what it is beginning of the month or the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| It is a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| If we can get a pilot program, that would be the greatest thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| and we've got Helen Moss McNabb ready to put a program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| but we've got to get the funding for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| So we need to find somewhere along the way that we can help our law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| be able to take care of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| As you said, Randy, the drugs and alcohol are kind of a generic problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| but they're the basis of all of our other problems, seemingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| So we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| One of the things that we found out at TCCA when we were down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| was one of the biggest things that we've got to look for in the future, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| is our infrastructure and our roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| We are known as a pay-as-you-go state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| It brings in commerce and extra tax dollars to where we put those tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6111)|
| 1:41:58| towards some of these problems that you all are discussing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| So we've got to figure out a way to increase our tax revenue to address these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| and if we let our roads go, then some of the people that are coming in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| because of our infrastructure will not be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| So that's another problem we need to talk about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| So it's, you know, which came first, the chicken or the egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| So we've got to figure out which one is our most priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| and I think that work session would be a great place to really get down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| and discuss the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| I agree with you on the ñ I appreciate Commissioner Thomas pointing out the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| that we do have a work session between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| and the proposed meeting with the Board of Education and the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| If seeing no further lights, we will carry this as a discussion item into the next month work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6168)|
| 1:42:59| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| Discussion regarding the sale of property off of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Mr. Chairman, what I would like clarification off of this property here is a sale of property off of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| Now, I know it gave the description on the map here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| but there were two pieces of property that the county owns on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| There's a 50-acre track and there's a 32-acre track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| I want to make sure that this property where you're talking about this sale of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| is the one that was for the Gibbs Middle School that was purchased, I think, back in í97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| I think it was the Tyndall Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| The piece of property proposed for sale is located near Atkins Road on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6225)|
| 1:43:53| And it has to do nothing with the one that was bought out there for Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| If there be no further discussion, we have one more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| Discussion of a special call meeting to discuss consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| I just think it would be best if we sat down and had a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| and went over how we're going to put things on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| and the processes we're going to take to run these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| so that we don't start the meetings off 30, 40 minutes to get our agenda set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| Go over the rules and everybody have a good understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6282)|
| 1:44:53| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| I think Randy's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| It would be a great idea for us to sit down and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| especially since we've updated our commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| and go over that and talk about how we do the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| But instead of a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| could we just take part of our time at our next work session and do it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| I'll be here for the next 40 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| Or we could do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| That's what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| The items that were in 1 through 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6325)|
| 1:45:36| and the other items from there to the end of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| are in two separate classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| And I believe the law director gave us good direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| on anything on consent that is in today's agenda beyond 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6351)|
| 1:46:01| that we could stop and talk about if we would just pull it off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| and talk about it after the consent calendar has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| The question that we have before us is what do we do with those 1 through 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6373)|
| 1:46:24| Commissioner McKenzie, I think, was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Is that okay, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| You know, we've been around this barn, down this road a few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| as it relates to our interactions with the resolutions that the school board gives us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6401)|
| 1:46:49| And it's been a, you know, rallying point, point of contention, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| We've just kind of been all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| And I guess my bottom line issue is I want to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| And I do understand the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| There's been several items over this past seven and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| that I've had some major misgivings about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| And we've discussed them and we've brought them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| But there's an agreed order out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| And our law director has talked with us about that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| And I think he opined today that kind of gives us directions as to how we should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6453)|
| 1:47:43| I just think some people disagree with the order, which I guess is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| But let's just say we're going to take it back to court and try to get rid of the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| But we're just pecking around the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| I'm not in that camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| I don't think we need to do that, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| But, you know, if that's what this body really wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| if we want to get back into school board business like it was in the good old days of county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6489)|
| 1:48:19| and we want to take that step backwards, let's just be open and just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| But I just think, and I'm not saying that happened today, Commissioner Bussard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| so please don't take it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| It's just, like I said, we've been talking about this for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| So if we want to get back to that stance, I think we just need to be deliberate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6513)|
| 1:48:42| And just, you know, talking about it took a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| We didn't have anything to discuss today in form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| We all knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| The only two things is what Dwight brought us last Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| and this was just formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| We wanted to make sure we got the names down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| It was brought to us at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| So those two things from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| So I think I agree with you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| This is a great time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| There was always going to be a window from five to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| So, you know, I guess I chose wisely in terms of time management for us to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6557)|
| 1:49:29| It just, it troubles me that we're, we have rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| We're a body of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| Without our rules, we're nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| So the rules or not following rules are what led to the Black Wednesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| and all those, you know, like I say, dark days of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| So I don't want us to start doing our own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| And, you know, like I say, if there's rules out there, let's abide by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Let's change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Let's amend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Let's suspend them, but let's make a conscious effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| and not just keep talking about consent items like they're regular items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| school board consent like it's regular consent because we all know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| So that's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| That's my driver for bringing this whole issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| I think today that a lot of clarity has been brought to us by our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| Over the years, we've been operating under a system that we can pull these, and it was SOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6638)|
| 1:50:47| And as I mentioned before last meeting, a lot of times when I pull one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| it's so that John Q. Public and those listening and watching can get the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| Possibly maybe they've got a question on it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| But if we're going to define this, whether it's going to be at the workshop meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| and we can beat them to death then before it goes on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| that's where we're at right now according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| So our new agenda has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| We just, as I said, we've been operating under the old rules and regs before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| but if we're going to do this, we can do it as long as we all play by the same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| And you want to interrupt me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| No, I don't want to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Are you speaking about on today's consent agenda 1 through 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| or are you speaking about the rest of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Whether it's, well, school's agenda primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| because it's been SOP that we could pull those before and ask questions about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| I mean, I've done it 50 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| I voted against them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| But as we said today, we can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| If we're going to do that, you've got to do it at the workshop, not at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| So I don't see any need to have a special meeting to redefine what we've defined here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6738)|
| 1:52:26| As long as we're all playing by the same rules and in the same ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| John Q. Publish is going to have to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| They want the information we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| They're going to have to watch the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| or be here at the workshop rather than the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| So we may turn our crowd around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| But we've got a procedure set now, and let's run it at the flagpole and see who salutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6766)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Thank you, Chairman Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| Could we possibly maybe have the Rules Committee look at establishing two consent lists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| In other words, after the notary applications, what we do is we consider the school's consent list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| and take a vote on it, and then secondly do a consent list for the county-only items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| and then take a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| And then that way there's no confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| and then you would only pull items off of the second or the county consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| The law director has his light on right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| He may be opining about something just recently said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| I wanted to give clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| The consent agreement states that once a school item is placed on consent, it cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6826)|
| 1:53:57| So on your consent agenda, normal rule, including schools, it's set at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6837)|
| 1:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| It requires a unanimous vote to put something on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| And if a commissioner doesn't want something on consent, including schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| then you don't vote unanimously, and then you deal with it like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| However, this is where the complication comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| A school item that has already been appropriated for and already been budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| your vote is pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| The statute has already given the school board the power to expend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| If it requires matching funds, however, that's a different ballgame altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| And it can either be voted on in the workshop and placed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| It can be voted on in the workshop and not placed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| It can be treated like any other resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| So the rule for school board consent is once it's placed on consent at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6903)|
| 1:55:14| it cannot be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| That's really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| After that, whatever you do with the workshop, however it comes before you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| if you voted unanimously generally at the workshop, it goes on your consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6927)|
| 1:55:35| If it's a school item, when you come here at the normal commission meeting and it's on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| it stays on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| If it's a school item that never made consent, it never makes consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| If it's an item that's on consent by vote, any other item except for schools, you can pull at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6947)|
| 1:55:56| Schools, once on consent, is always on consent for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| That's the rule you need to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Everything else is straightforward like any other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| But once you place a school item on consent, it cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| That's about as clear as I can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| So the question is, is it on consent when it gets here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| That's the only thing you really have to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Everything else you treat with your normal rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| Commissioner Bussler defers to Commissioner Brantley, the elder statesman of West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=6993)|
| 1:56:44| I think he just wants the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| I just want to briefly just say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| One thing is that these school items have already been vetted by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| They've had hours of discussion on this before we even see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| And if you watch a school board meeting, you've heard all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| You've been down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| So it's not like all of a sudden they're trying to spring something on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| This is well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| And yes, it's a lot of money in some instances, but we voted these people in to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| And if they vote that that's what they want and that's what the schools need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| I think we should take that into consideration before we start at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| and try to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| So in keeping that in mind, I agree that we should just have one consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| But I think it's a great point that the law director just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| is that if it's not a unanimous vote, it can be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| So someone just needs to vote no on all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| or anything that there's any question about, and it comes back up in commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| It will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| So we can rotate the table if you want to, but that's the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| So now we all know the rules, so we ought to be able to live by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Thank you, Commissioner Busler, for deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| We're going to pause for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| because Commissioner Brantley raises the very root of the question that we have before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7094)|
| 1:58:27| Commissioner Busler was not here at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| The rest of us were, and we established the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| But if I had voted no in the work session on one of these 1 through 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7115)|
| 1:58:47| I'm going to have to talk an eye toward the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| Would that mean that that item that I voted no on would then be up for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7133)|
| 1:59:01| at the regular session of county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| It would be up for discussion even though it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| That would be a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| The only consent agreement we have, judicially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| is once a school item is placed on consent, it cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| You established that at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| If, however, a school item, there's two paths this can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| You vote no on an item of a school that is pro forma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| and once you discuss it, you have to pass it at this meeting anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| or you have an item that is not pre-appropriated for or is not budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| and you can vote unanimously for it at the workshop, it goes on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Then you can't pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| If you don't vote unanimously for it at that time, you can discuss it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| you can pass it, or you can deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| There's just two types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| One that's previously appropriated for and put on consent, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| One that's previously appropriated for that's not put on consent, you can discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| but then you've got to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| It's pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| All other items are treated as regular commission resolutions, whether it be a school item or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7223)|
| 2:00:35| The rule is once a school item is put on consent by this body at the workshop, it cannot be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| I believe now Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| Going back to answer a couple of things here, I have, on my instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| what I'm asking questions about are something that somebody has asked me in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| where they say, what about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| And I'm not sure with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| I want it clarified here at this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| Number two, it's our duty to also just kind of look at things for the taxpayers in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| If they want to know how the money's being spent, we ought to be able to tell them how it's been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| And those questions have to be answered and asked here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| because we cannot talk to each other privately unless we have a meeting and we put it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| And if we do that, you know, then it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| So how are we going to discuss things unless we don't discuss it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| And between the work session and this session, if a question is asked me that I don't know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| I'm going to ask it for my people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| That's what we are elected for, to answer their questions and to represent them up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| Now, I know that we're supposed to pass these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| I know what the ruling was by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| I know all that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| But you've got to remember, we've got to answer questions that our people ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| And some of these you've got to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| We just passed one last month that I asked a question on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| did you know one of those grants that we got, they got to hire six additional people outside the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| It wasn't handled inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| That's using taxpayers' money that the people need to know that that's how it's being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7351)|
| 2:02:37| Some of that grant money has been done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| It's for a one-time grant, and now next year those people probably will not be let go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| and we'll have to fund those six additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| This goes to work for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| But nobody seemed to care about that that's additional tax money we may have to come up with to support that system over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| But the people need to know those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| So why can't we ask it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Why can't we do our jobs like we're supposed to be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| Rule of law is we're going to pass it anyway, but people ought to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| And to reemphasize the points that you're making, people need to know the process will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7390)|
| 2:03:21| if it is on the school system and it's on consent on commission day, there is no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| The discussion will occur at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| It can always be discussed at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| Could I ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| No, we're in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| This is the scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| May I ask one other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Okay, I was out of town and I called in to say could we have some of these things pulled so we could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| I was told that probably the proper way of doing it is pulling it at our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| When we did this, I wasn't being able to be here on the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| It's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| The way the rules are being explained by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| But can I call in and say, can I do it if I'm not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| No, then we'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| We'll stand together and hold hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| We'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| The law director is shaking his head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| The items coming from the Board of Education at work session, we can ask questions and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7459)|
| 2:04:30| But when we get to unless there is a no vote in the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| then we can have more discussion and questions being asked at the regular stated meeting of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7477)|
| 2:04:46| but the item will pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| One last question, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Under Robert's Rules of Order, it says any item on the agenda can be discussed at any time as long as we are having our session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7492)|
| 2:05:03| Anything can be pulled and discussed at any time, even though we may have voted on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| like we voted on the school's items right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| If I could go back and if I had somebody to second me, say I'd like to discuss this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| then we can pull it back up and discuss it as long as we have it adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| Robert's Rules of Order are secondary to our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| So we'll have to look at what our rule is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| I thought we were operating under Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| We are operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| That's in the parentheses or whatever at the end of all the sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| Robert's Rules of Order, current edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| But for our rules of how we handle rules, they apply first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7544)|
| 2:05:53| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Sir, please go to Commissioner Brown first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| He don't want me to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Are you going to defer to the elder statesman from South Niagara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| I'm going to defer to my elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Well, you know, here's what's caused part of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| For the last I don't know how long, before the workshop we get a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| all these items are going to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| And we just assumed that, you know, we can trade them like we always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7582)|
| 2:06:29| But we've sat today and everybody, all 11 of us here, have heard what the actual rule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| So the way I'm seeing it right now, everything comes into the workshop a virgin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| And then we've got to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| Every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| Has been the practice always of the chair to say these items will be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| And in the last meeting, I believe I named two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| One because it had a vacant space and one because it was just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| You are responsible to withdraw anything in the world you want to and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7623)|
| 2:07:09| You mentioned the two items that would be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| We were getting a list of items that was to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| But as I say, right now, that's out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| There ain't nothing on consent when we walk in here and say the pledge on workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| We start fresh, zero, ground zero right from that day and work it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| If you want to talk about it, we'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| As long as everybody knows that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Then, you know, if you know the rules of the game, you can play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7654)|
| 2:07:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I think it would be wise of us to do all this in the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| and have nobody vote in the negative to bring something up a second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| before this regular full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| That's what our work sessions are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| I've read the dissent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| To me, it simply states that when something's put on the consent item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| the school calendar consent item, that it can't be taken back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| So I would say that it would be best for us, most efficient of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| and the other people who are involved in these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| to go through this stuff in the work session, put it on the consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| I mean, most of this stuff we can't, even if we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| we couldn't do anything about because of the way our laws are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| We waste a lot of time talking about things that we can't do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| I know it's important to get the information out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| but, you know, if you watch the school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| it all pretty much gets out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| Dave's commented several times that we've been in here asking the same exact questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| that the people at the school system face from the members of the BOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| I just think we don't need a special work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| I think everybody has a grasp of this rule now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| Let's try to do this in a way that works efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Seeing the last light of the evening, Commissioner Thomas will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| I think he's going to make a brief statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| or comment about what the item that we're discussing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| but then he's going to kick off announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| So if you have any announcements to make before we adjourn, please be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| I just want to make sure that any of our constituents are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| because Commissioner Busser stated that we couldn't discuss some items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| if they were already on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| I just want to make sure that if they're watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| and they asked him a question and they want answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| that we still, regardless of being on consent, can add it as a discussion item at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| It will be after the vote, but at least they can get all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| We can hash it out all we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| I just want to make sure everybody that's watching understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| And the other thing is, tomorrow night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| Ed and I are going to be at Love That Barbecue on Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| and Mr. Love will have some great barbecue cooking there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| and Commissioner Brown will be out there, I'll bet, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| Ed told me he'd buy me a barbecue sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| We hope any elected officials and all the public come out and say hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| It's in South Knoxville, of course, in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| We'd love to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| That's 5 till 7 tomorrow night on Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| It's Love That Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| Commissioner Brown, announcements now, announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| I just want to let you know, Dave, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7853)|
| 2:11:01| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| You and I both are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| Thanksgiving is coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| and I just want to remind everybody that no matter where you're at in life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| and how life's treating you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=7873)|

| 2:13:53| and will be here in about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| We would ask approval according to MPC staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| We originally asked that both parcels carry a sector plan for industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8041)|
| 2:14:08| After meetings with MPC staff, we determined that the east parcel would not have active mining on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8048)|
| 2:14:16| Our client is acquiring that property to relocate the entrance road into the quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| and we agreed with MPC staff recommendation to leave the sector plan alone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8062)|

| 2:14:46| My only comment, Gerald Green, MPC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| my only comment is that this is an MPC staff and commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8089)|
| 2:14:58| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| I make a motion that we accept as proposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| The motion is probably before us to rezone for I-75 quarry per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8106)|
| 2:15:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8119)|

| 2:15:50| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, here again on behalf of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| and we would support the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| I might just throw in this is the second time you've heard zoning on new parcels for this quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| You will also have before you next month an amendment to the mining plan for this quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8168)|
| 2:16:17| Quarries or mining operations generally are unique under the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| A mining plan, which is sort of in the form of use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| requires approval not only of the Planning Commission but also of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| and that mining plan went before the Planning Commission last meeting, which was last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| and will be before you next meeting at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| If you all will approve the revised mining plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| this quarry will be in business for another 50 years without further appearing before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8210)|
| 2:16:58| except for maybe a road alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8218)|

| 2:17:07| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| MPC did recommend approval of the industrial zoning for parcel 017-03903| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8231)|
| 2:17:20| and recommended denying industrial zoning on parcel 017-038.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| As Mr. Seymour said previously, rezoning of that parcel was not necessary for the use proposed by the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8246)|
| 2:17:34| And again, not to repeat too much of what Mr. Seymour said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| the mining plan will be before you at your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| That has been approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| I make a motion that we approve the rezoning as per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| If not, the motion is properly before us as relates to aggregate USA for the I-75 quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8275)|
| 2:18:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8284)|

| 2:18:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| The requested rezoning is consistent with sector plan and growth plan for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| and is also consistent with adjoining development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| Staff and MPC recommend approval of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8344)|

| 2:19:57| And I should have gotten Mr. Seymour to stand on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| It seems like he's got a pretty good record right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8401)|

| 2:20:19| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| The MPC has recommended approval of the rezoning as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| The property currently is split zone with a portion of it being RA and the remaining portion agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8426)|
| 2:20:32| The RA zoning is present on three sides of the property currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| It is only 0.4 acre, so the most that could be developed on it under the proposed zoning is three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8437)|
| 2:20:48| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| Commissioners discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| I'll make a motion to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| I have a motion to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| I have a motion to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| I was just going to mention the total track is like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| One point two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| And I think the community was a little concerned because I had some phone calls after the MPC meeting that they thought something different was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| But basically you're going to build the triplex on that portion that was just rezoned because of the sinkhole on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| When the lady called me, she thought I was doing like a 20 plex back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| So she was not very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| But after we've staked it out, it may only be big enough for a duplex in which this is kind of futile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| But if we can squeeze a triplex back there, that is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| Did I ask if there was opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8506)|
| 2:21:47| This is not a spirited enough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8510)|

| 2:24:50| The proposed use would be compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8690)|

| 2:25:02| and proposes low-density residential for the property, which would be compatible with the proposed zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8702)|

| 2:26:26| The applicant requested a sector plan change and rezoning up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8786)|

| 2:27:14| Mr. Green, there was a question in regard to a previous zoning on Black Road a couple of months ago, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8834)|
| 2:27:22| But you told me that we do count previous development's traffic counts and a new development's traffic count, even if it's not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8842)|
| 2:27:30| In the traffic plan, the traffic analysis considers anticipated traffic from growth and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=8850)|

| 2:30:37| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| Let me just make one quick comment about the one before that that we skipped over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| We mentioned earlier on development, which is the property on Johnsonville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| diagonal across the street from Marble Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| A community did meet with him about 10 days ago, and we agreed to this postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9052)|
| 2:31:02| for a shovel test because it's very possible that there are relics of John Sabir's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| He had houses all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| He had 18 kids, and they had houses all over them hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| So it may be necessary to postpone it again until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| We'll see if they get their shovel test done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| So it's in the works, and we're also doing a traffic study, traffic out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9081)|
| 2:31:28| Which one are you looking at there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9088)|

| 2:31:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| The one we postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| But we're on the last one right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| I'd say you skipped over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| We talked about it earlier, but I wanted to bring out those points in regard to it now for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| We'll revisit that one in just a moment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9109)|
| 2:31:57| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| I'm a little bit giggling, and I don't think I called on you, did I, or did I not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| I believe you did, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| What we have properly before us is a request of Robert Byrne for a rezoning of a density up to 4.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9130)|
| 2:32:20| Dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| 4.8 dwellings per acre in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| I wish now to back up to the third from the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| What about the last one on the last page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| Oh, turn the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| 9-C-15-RC is request of John King for rezoning for agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| Property located southeast side of Bob Kirby Road, southwest of Middlebrook Park in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9183)|
| 2:33:13| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| My name is John King, address 321 East Copeland Drive, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9196)|
| 2:33:25| Do you wish to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| No comments, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| The requested rezoning would be compatible with the sector plan and will allow uses that are compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| The proposed zoning would also provide a transition from the commercial areas to the lower density residential areas and is appropriate for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9225)|
| 2:33:54| The MPC staff and Commission have recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| Do you wish to speak, Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| Sir, is this back up to what used to be Countryside Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| It's actually adjoining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| If you're looking at it from Bob Kirby, it would be to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| And I guess my question is there's a restaurant developer going in right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| I did hear that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| Previously there was a Daniel or Bud or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| There was a guy that owns it now has a variance on there that will allow beer to be sold at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9270)|
| 2:34:39| He owns both pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Are you buying it from the guy that owns Countryside Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| I think he was involved at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| There's actually some title issues that we're working through on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| One of the variances is to allow the restaurant to be there and have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| Are you going to keep that variance in there, or does that variance go with the property, or how does that go, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| I would need to look at the language of that variance to know exactly what was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| So I will put that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| The owner of both properties, he owned the restaurant and the adjoining property, or he was involved in the restaurant adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9313)|
| 2:35:20| Vernon's, I believe, was the name of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| Got a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| He had to write off on the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| He owned the property, so he varianced his own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| But I'm kind of concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| Somebody's invested a large amount of money in there right now, and I don't want them not to be able to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| As far as the adjoining property, we wouldn't have any objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| I just don't want to handcuff somebody that's about to invest, or that is investing a lot of money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| I like the word handcuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| On the drinking thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| That was a policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| So you're okay to keep that variance if they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| I'm not advocating for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| They're investing money currently, and I want them to be able to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| I wouldn't be opposed to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| And probably help you sell your product a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| In fact, when I learned about his investing in doing a restaurant concept, I was ecstatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9370)|
| 2:36:21| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| I think it will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Well-known guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| He's got a good product everywhere he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9385)|
| 2:36:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| This question is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| On the application, the proposed use, I've never seen this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| It says attached residential development and personal storage units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9400)|
| 2:36:47| I think the storage units were maybe on the original application, and they've kept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| We had looked to doing some storage specific to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9415)|
| 2:37:05| not to just the general public, just specific to that PUD or a condo, depending on our regime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9425)|
| 2:37:17| But that was the intent originally, but the site's not going to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| I was going to say, because you only have five acres and you can do 50 dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| Just 50 dwellings is all that we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| Five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| Did I call on Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| Yeah, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| He's talking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| What we have properly before us is a motion of request of John King to rezone on Middlebrook Park in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9476)|
| 2:38:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9497)|
| 2:38:21| Now we can back up to H.E. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| It has been read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| This is a request of H.E. Biddle for rezoning from A on Hardin Valley, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9508)|
| 2:38:37| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| Was this on last month's and we moved it to this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Was this the same one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| No, this is the one that was moved right there from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| Make a motion to move until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| We have before us a motion and a second to move this item to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9537)|
| 2:38:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| Commissioner Brown, we'll plow this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| TN-015RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| First off, let me apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| I thought you'd already voted earlier when I wanted to jab that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| We did meet with the developer and he's agreed to do a shovel test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| I don't know how long that's going to take to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| There's a possibility it might go into January, but we're taking it month by month here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| and see if it's done by December, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| But as I said a while ago, you know, John Sevier had 18 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9574)|
| 2:39:37| and they were scattered all over them hills out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| So there could be things they find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| But so far they're working pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| There's an area left in the back, kind of a park-like open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| and they've agreed to leave the buffers we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| So we'll talk about all that when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| But we're okay right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| Yeah, I would suggest that we get the mayor out there with his metal detector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| and let him go at it for a day and see if he can find something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| or find Bigfoot, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| I may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| Mr. Green, if you would, could you supply us with a map of the urban growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| so that we know what we're facing in the future as far as development and density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| Okay, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| A wise man sitting closely behind me said that we actually needed a motion to defer that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9628)|
| 2:40:34| You just introduced it at commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9637)|
| 2:40:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom151116?start=9638)|
