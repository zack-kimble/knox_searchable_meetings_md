| 2:43:42| said, if we open this door to allow a medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| density to go in, especially at 12 per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| there's an awful lot of opportunity on Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| And Dutchtown Road can't handle that extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| And just as you heard before, if you open this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| door, you're not going to be able to close this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| We ask that you keep this at a low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| residential place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9851)|
| 2:44:11| I'll get to Commissioner Jay in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| but I want to get a clarification from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| He had mentioned low density residential, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| it also mentioned six units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| Where's that cut off between low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| residential and medium density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| It's at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| So one to five is considered low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| So six would still require the MDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9872)|
| 2:44:32| That's kind of what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| So, sir, I'm not putting words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| but you had said medium density and you had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| six and you had said low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9880)|
| 2:44:40| Yes, we were asking for low density when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| spoke with Mr. Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| You know, we had talked about different sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| and we're not looking to keep the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| We find him, like I said, we feel he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| very a very gracious neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| And we're hoping that if the body sees fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| that anywhere from, you know, no more than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| So if low density or or low mid density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| medium density, maybe that could make his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| We're not looking to keep him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| We're just looking for a compromise and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9910)|
| 2:45:11| keep our neighborhood our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| And like, you know, Stan said before, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| a lot of kids running up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| We've got traffic as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9922)|
| 2:45:22| I'll go back to Commissioner Jay had his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Then I recognized Mr. Schoonmaker after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| By the way, earlier we had said that we had let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| the the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| Sir, I do want to go back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| I did say that and it agreed with you that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| wanted to be able to make a rebuttal statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| after they had spoken as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| So would you like to make a statement right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| before I go to Commissioner Jay and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| Yes, I'm not a typical developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| I don't do this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| This is all new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| So you have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| I apologize for not knowing the procedures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| not being properly prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| I like to thank Mr. Williams for the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| words he said about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| We did have a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9969)|
| 2:46:10| I thought we had that understanding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| understand also that they had to they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| it's only made with four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| That doesn't represent the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| And something I did keep reminding them that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| you know, this lot is these two lots is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| zone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| And so something, you know, it could be I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| could be a lot worse right now than what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| planning on doing, which is, you know, putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| You can even put a gas station in that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| which, you know, the amount of traffic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| we'll have compared to apartments, you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| really compare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| You know, apartments, the amount of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| we talk about traffic, you know, people go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| work, you know, in the morning and then come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| back in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10019)|
| 2:47:00| It's definitely not traffic time for school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10020)|
| 2:47:04| So I don't think that the traffic is it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10024)|
| 2:47:08| become an issue compared to what is internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| You know, we are in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| We do have two access roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| We have Bob Kirby and we have Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| Dutchtown Road there has a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| It could be actually two access points on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| Dutchtown Road for that lot and one access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| from Bob Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| I'm planning on putting some nice apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10054)|
| 2:47:35| And as we discussed with the neighbors, they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| concerned about lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| And I told them I was going to put lighting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| So they were concerned about drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| And, you know, I told them, you know, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| definitely do the best we can to keep good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| tenants there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| I'm not really sure what else I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10081)|
| 2:48:02| So I'm going to recognize Commissioner Jay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| then Commissioner Schoonmaker and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| A question for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| At the requested up to 10 units an acre, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| help just help us visualize what could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| built under that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| How many units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| I know this is, we're back to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| We have a, trying to understand the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| before we get to that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| But maybe you, sir, you could sort of explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| describe it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| I'd like to add that the MPC recommended 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| It says up here that the recommendation is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10124)|
| 2:48:44| The staff recommended originally 12 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| It was during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| Am I reading this incorrectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| It changed to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10131)|
| 2:48:51| But the original request or recommendation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| the staff was 12 units, 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| The request was 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10140)|
| 2:49:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10140)|

| 2:49:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10143)|
| 2:49:03| And can you help me visualize what up to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| might look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10145)|
| 2:49:06| You know, I haven't done, I haven't, we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10146)|

| 2:49:20| There could be, you know, a relatively small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| scale apartment that could be put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10163)|

| 2:49:37| I'd have to do a quick calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| If you're asking what I'm planning on putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| there, so it will be three buildings of eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10180)|

| 2:49:46| is that under your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10186)|

| 2:50:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| Okay, let me do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| Ms. Brooks, first, congratulations on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| appointment to internship as the director of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10262)|
| 2:51:09| As we often do when we focus on sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| changes, there has to be a reason for a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| MPC has given the reason of additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| opportunities for a variety of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| housing are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| That can be true of any two-acre lot in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10289)|
| 2:51:29| So are we going to start doubling what's next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| door because of needed opportunities on every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| piece of property that's out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| Secondly, they state that it will serve as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| buffer between the commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| I look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| I don't see any commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| There's nothing on the other side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| that's commercial for it to be buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| There is on the other side of Bob Kirby, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| small, maybe three-quarter, half-acre neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| commercial piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| And I'm not sure under our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| commercial restraints that you can even develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| a track of land that small as neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| Whenever I look at the sector plan, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| sector plan was done in 2016, and it says in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| here that there's been no utility or road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| changes or anything that has happened since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| Whenever I look at the sector plan for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| area, you go from west to Cedar Bluff on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10348)|
| 2:52:34| north side of Dutchtown Road all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| Marbury Hood, and there is nothing but LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10357)|
| 2:52:40| There is a lot of apartments on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| side of Cedar Bluff, but in this section, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| all LDR, low-density residential, and it's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| very old, established LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| The problem I have with medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| residential is not exactly this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| It's the fact that there are multiple properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| on that north side of Dutchtown between there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| and Marbury Hood that are two-acre, three-acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| And if we open that door, they're all going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| be here wanting 20, 30 units and a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| coming out every 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| You know, if this were developed, if the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| plan would have included this whole area as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| MDR and it could be developed as one MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| development with controlled access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| that's different than five of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| with curb cuts and 30 cars coming out every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| I just think this is part of our problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10422)|
| 2:53:50| development, that if it was intended to be MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10430)|
| 2:53:55| in the sector plan, that it should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| MDR in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| And this is quite a jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| I mean, maybe the neighborhood commercial is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| out the window and will never be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| but I'm sure when it was put there, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| all trying to get walkable communities, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| place that you could walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| I'm going to let Brad comment and then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| chime back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10459)|

| 2:54:29| would one need for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10469)|
| 2:54:30| I mean, when you talk about constraints or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| even 20 apartments, it seems a bit, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10473)|
| 2:54:38| the constraints you were speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Parking would be a constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| There might be hydrology issues that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| unaware of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10483)|

| 2:54:46| potential impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10486)|

| 2:55:09| his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10509)|
| 2:55:10| So I think if we get to that point before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| announce the vote, I think we need to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| about, because if we turn this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10513)|
| 2:55:17| down, does that, Daniel, does that send him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| back to no more sector plans for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| Is that the same rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| Just on the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| But if the sector plan doesn't go, he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| get his zonings out the door anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10529)|
| 2:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10529)|
| 2:55:29| I just don't want to, I don't want to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| his property hostage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| I completely agree with you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| Mr. Snowden, this property is in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| of sinkholes and I believe there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| special requirements for detention that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| apply to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10555)|
| 2:55:55| Commissioner, this is in our special sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| policy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| So there would be an additional retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| policy that would apply for this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| And that would mean he would have to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| or detain water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| He could release water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| But what we would do is there's a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| amount of water that leaves that site right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10577)|
| 2:56:18| We would allow him to release that water and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| that water only and everything above and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| beyond that he would have to detain on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| and it would never be able to leave the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Director Brooks, when was the last time we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10591)|
| 2:56:36| approved MDR on a two-acre tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| I don't know that answer off the top of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10606)|
| 2:56:47| Well, I'm going to make a motion and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10607)|
| 2:56:54| yield to Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10616)|
| 2:56:56| Commissioner Gills recognized and we'll come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| back to Commissioner Smith for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| I just need to make sure the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| understands what's going on because I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10627)|
| 2:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10627)|
| 2:57:07| Because I'm not sure if he's understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| what what's going on and if he has the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| to make some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| Does he have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| Commissioner Gill's question is was really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| you know, we're we're being very sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| We want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| Yeah, I'm not really sure what's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| happening besides trying to approve low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| density or medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| Well, and here's kind of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| You've got a piece of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| And it's I think everybody here agrees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| there's probably not a commercial use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| So you're going to be better off, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| opinion, and it seems as if probably what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| you've got, why you've identified it and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| even the neighbors, everybody realizes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| this is something that should be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| housing in some way, shape or form rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| than commercial because you won't be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10684)|
| 2:58:05| to compete with anything up and down Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| That said, you know, what we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| trying to do is to find something because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| there's also I think Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| had mentioned that about on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| going almost towards the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| But even if you go towards Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| there's also a lot of bigger lots that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| still zoned agriculture there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| So I think what what I'm hearing is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| folks that are somewhat hesitant to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| something go in at medium density at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| plan level, because next thing you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| you're going to see up and down that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| road, a whole bunch of things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10717)|
| 2:58:38| popping up at six, eight, ten units up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| down that road because this precedent has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| So with that said, what Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| was was advocating for you for was to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| that, you know, we'll probably Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| Smith is going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| And just so you know, as a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| routine, we usually the commissioner whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| district that a land zoning issue, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| in that particular commissioner's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10743)|
| 2:59:04| that's the one we look to for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| He'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| We're going to go back to you to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| sure you also understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| We'll vote however we feel inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| But we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| I will in your case, since I know you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| your words not mine, that this is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| your first development deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| We want to make sure you understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| potential outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| And I look also to Commissioner Gill to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| make sure that I think we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| Are you on the same page with us here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| terms of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| OK, so what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| It's got to be for changing for selecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| low density or medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| Yeah, likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10776)|
| 2:59:37| But I'll look to Commissioner Smith for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10779)|
| 2:59:39| I don't know what the motion he'll make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| So but he will be he'll be making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| shortly and then we can clarify that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| you as well moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| I'll look look to you for a motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| And I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10793)|

| 3:01:48| It may be that a lower substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| lower density on the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10912)|

| 3:01:57| Maybe the planning commission hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10917)|

| 3:02:02| So if they would consider that, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10924)|

| 3:02:31| The planning commission has to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=10951)|

| 3:06:05| But Mr. Smith has just said for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| applicant and for the audience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| and remember what we're voting on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| not the zoning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| This is the sector plan which was last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| updated in 2016 to deny the request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11175)|
| 3:06:21| MDR to ask the Planning Commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| consider set evaluating and then sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| us a request for a LDR change to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| sector plan for this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11192)|
| 3:06:36| Now that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| One quick question, though, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| sector plan itself and I'm going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11202)|
| 3:06:43| to the currently the sector plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| Does it call for LDR or MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| What is the sector plan call for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| particular neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| Yeah, it's so but that's that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11218)|
| 3:06:59| So that whole corridor is neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| commercial on the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| It's just that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| There's there's a few proper parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| right there at Bob Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11227)|
| 3:07:08| Okay, so this is literally kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| the little that the one little deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| that's got that it's just been carved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| out of the sector plan and carved out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11237)|
| 3:07:17| Okay, all right, just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| Okay, so back to Commissioner Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11241)|
| 3:07:22| You heard me state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| Now, sir, do you understand what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11246)|
| 3:07:27| And it's really I think the body is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| expressing an interest in considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| this property more up to a number of up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| I'm sorry, is there a restate of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| motion? Is there a second for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11260)|
| 3:07:41| motion, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| All right, from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| So do you understand the motion that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11267)|
| 3:07:48| Is that something that you would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| open to considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| Can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Is that something that I know you came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| to us originally requesting the higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| level is that it's your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| You know, we can vote and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| just deny it or put it straight up for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11282)|
| 3:08:05| vote later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11285)|
| 3:08:05| But the motion that the vote in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| us, and I haven't counted any votes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| it appears to me trying to read the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| that it's likely to pass, is to send this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| back to the Planning Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| consideration of low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| rather than the medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| that you've requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11301)|
| 3:08:22| Either way, you still get a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| zoning or it's changed residential in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11308)|
| 3:08:28| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| So I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| So, you know, the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| already recommended for medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| and their recommendation of 10 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| acre. So what's going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| I mean, what if they come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| recommend the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| Well, we're the alpha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| They're underneath us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11324)|
| 3:08:45| So it's kind of just to be blunt, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11325)|
| 3:08:50| over the Planning Commission on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| So this is the body that makes final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| decisions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| And that's, you know, they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| recommend all they want at the staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| the Commission level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| And then it's this body that makes all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11343)|
| 3:09:05| final decisions and hears appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| So the motion is, your motion is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| change it from medium density to low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11350)|
| 3:09:13| density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11353)|
| 3:09:13| It's currently zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| neighborhood commercial, and the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11355)|
| 3:09:16| that Commissioner Smith has made is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11356)|
| 3:09:19| change it to residential, but not at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| medium density residential, but for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| sector plan to be then be changed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| low density residential for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| So my option is to, I'm worried what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| Well, I think it's more important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| state in this motion, sir, is to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| and Planning Commission time to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| the process and see if there's somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| you can meet in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| This is not a denial in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| It is a, let's send it back and see if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| can get it back on the table for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| for your, to protect you from getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| your property being held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| Nothing, if we vote yes tonight, nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| changes on your zoning until MPC Brute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| reviews it, works with you guys, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| comes back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11409)|
| 3:10:10| Nothing changes on your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| It's more along the lines of let's make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| sure we got our I's dotted and our T's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| crossed, give you an opportunity to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| survey the neighborhood to see if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11421)|
| 3:10:24| can come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| Otherwise, a denial would stop you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| your tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| And I think what he's trying to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| give you an opportunity to try to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11430)|
| 3:10:31| with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11431)|
| 3:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11432)|
| 3:10:33| Is that fair, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| I mean, it's, I mean, not a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| are comfortable with going to medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| And so I think there's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| Instead of turning you down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11444)|
| 3:10:45| it's sending it back for another review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11445)|
| 3:10:48| But the motion was to deny MDR and send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| back for LDR review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| But nothing's final until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11457)|
| 3:10:58| But the denial of MDR would be, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11458)|
| 3:11:04| Yeah, that'd be, that would be it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| Yeah, that would be a denial of MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| So by the way, Commissioner Smith, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| got the floor from the motion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| afterwards I know that Commissioner Gill's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| light came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11475)|
| 3:11:16| We're trying to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| But let me make sure, let me, we, the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11479)|
| 3:11:25| is to return this back to Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11485)|
| 3:11:29| Planning, Planning Commission, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| you and the neighborhood could meet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11492)|
| 3:11:33| the middle with a number of apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| complexes that will make sense for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11502)|
| 3:11:42| So there's, there's somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| middle to be worked between low and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11507)|
| 3:11:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| And that's what we're trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11508)|
| 3:11:49| out in terms of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11512)|
| 3:11:52| So that you don't have a denial that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| can then broker the conversation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| That's what he's working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| No, not exactly, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| Go ahead and let Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| All right, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11531)|
| 3:12:12| Commissioner Bussler and then Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11536)|
| 3:12:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| What they're trying to do right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| and we've heard some suggestions from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| Mr. Snowden down here that the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| what you originally asked for, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11546)|
| 3:12:29| won't work because of parking and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| other issues about sinkholes and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| We don't want to lock your land up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| one year if we go ahead and vote like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11563)|
| 3:12:44| What we're trying to do is give you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| option to go back to MPC and discuss and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| say, well, if I can't get this, then can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11572)|
| 3:12:53| And then it comes back to us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| What we're trying to do is protect you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11575)|
| 3:12:58| where you're not locked up for that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11580)|
| 3:13:00| Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| It's going to take several tries, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11588)|
| 3:13:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11590)|
| 3:13:11| I just wanted to be clear, want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| sure the gentleman's clear, because as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| understand Commissioner Smith's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| this would be a denial of the medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| And we would be sending this back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11603)|
| 3:13:26| Planning Commission to see if they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| reach an agreeable density level at low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11609)|
| 3:13:33| density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| It appears to me from the discussion from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| the neighborhood and just the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| about the overall area that MDR, medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| density residential, is not a viable option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11624)|
| 3:13:48| that, I mean, again, I may be presumptuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| but as I read the room, I don't think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| body is ready to approve medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11636)|
| 3:13:57| I know that was the recommendation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11637)|
| 3:13:58| Planning Commission, but it was also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| very split recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| So I believe, am I correct, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| Smith, that that's the essence of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| motion is to send it back for low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| recommendation, but to deny medium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| So if you deny the medium density, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| met with MPC and they said, well, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| we can work maybe with seven units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| acre, but that's above the low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| It's back into the medium, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| already denied the medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11668)|
| 3:14:29| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| Does that mean that you have denied it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| already and it's not going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| I think a clarification would be what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| the maximum number of units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| available with LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11677)|
| 3:14:38| Is it five and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11678)|
| 3:14:39| Is it less than six or is it top at five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11679)|
| 3:14:42| Top at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| Okay, so at LDR, the maximum number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| units per acre would be five units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| Okay, back to, I've got actually Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| Sanders, then Schoonmaker, and then back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| I was just going to clarify that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| that there's not really a medium, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| not a place between low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11704)|
| 3:15:07| residential and medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11709)|
| 3:15:09| It's one or the other, and if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| desire to approve this at six dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| units per acre, it needs to be medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| Low density will accommodate up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| Yep, there's no, if you want five and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| half, it need to be done at medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11727)|
| 3:15:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| You purchased this property in May of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| 2019, and when you purchased it, what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| your intent knowing that the zoning was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| My intention was what I'm trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| today, to change it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| Okay, and planning, what is the filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| fee for a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| Ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| Six hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11759)|
| 3:16:05| Back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11765)|
| 3:16:11| You know, that's kind of the problem we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| have is that our LDR only goes to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| You know, in the city, it goes to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11776)|
| 3:16:17| There's no kind of middle ground there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| and I am, you know, in all honesty, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| see six, seven units on this, but my real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| fear is what it triggers down the road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11785)|

| 3:16:31| That's one reason why I want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| with the sector plan to LDR, and if in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| that time it's not feasible for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| develop at five units an acre, it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| back before us, and we can just withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11803)|
| 3:16:47| it, and he keeps his current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11807)|
| 3:16:54| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11814)|

| 3:17:39| Mr. Law Director, is that one to mute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11859)|

| 3:18:37| Okay, Mr. Law Director, if we defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| and it comes back, we can adjust the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| density to fit into the LDR, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| Well, that's the discussion that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11924)|
| 3:18:47| a moment ago with Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| I would hope that Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| would make a recommendation for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| zoning together with the low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11935)|

| 3:18:59| low-density residential that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| could consider at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| Without the MDR, you can't approve up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11947)|
| 3:19:08| Right, but could we amend the same motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| since he's paid for that fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| Could we amend that density down to fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| within the LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| That's up to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11957)|
| 3:19:23| Commissioner Smith, can you restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| If the sector plan comes back at LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| with the zoning resolution at 10 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11973)|
| 3:19:37| an acre, could we just amend that down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| fit the LDR designation at our meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| Or would there have to be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11985)|
| 3:19:46| Or would you all send a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| for zoning with the LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| I don't know that we would be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| send a recommendation back to you if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| didn't also reconsider the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| application, but I would defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12001)|
| 3:20:02| Well, there's a difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12002)|
| 3:20:03| reconsidering and a need to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| I think that's kind of the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12005)|
| 3:20:06| We wouldn't make him reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12006)|
| 3:20:07| Yeah, I mean, he's already spent his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| money. That's what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12009)|
| 3:20:10| I would send it back with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| plan, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12012)|

| 3:20:14| That's fine. The motion in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| would be to remand the zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| Planning Commission to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12018)|
| 3:20:19| recommendation consistent with its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12019)|

| 3:20:28| send this zoning distantly back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200727?start=12028)|
