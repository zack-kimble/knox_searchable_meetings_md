| 0:00:42| Before we do a roll call, I'd like to ask Virginia Babb to lead us in a Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=48)|

| 0:02:34| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| All right. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| We only have one item on the agenda for today and that is to, frankly, just get an update on the status of the Andrew Johnson building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| and the possibility that we've all heard about with moving into TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| I'm going to ask Mr. Caldwell to begin that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| I know you've got a few other folks who are here with you to assist, but I'm going to go turn the floor over to you and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| I think it was months ago, I know I was tired of getting questions about it, so I asked you, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| why don't we just have an update on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| That may have been back in February or March, so I'm glad that we were finally able to get this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| So thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| You've been asked about that, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Yeah, believe it or not, I've been asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| I don't get asked anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you all for having this joint workshop and allowing us to come and present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| We're going to break up our slideshow into sections, and so eventually I will turn it over to Mike Dooley from Barbara McMurray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| and then he will turn it over to, I think, Jane Burrett to talk about security a little bit from PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| and then we will turn it over to Partners Development, either Kevin or Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| to talk about their role in this and what we bring to you as far as a recommendation and where we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| And so we're going to go through this slideshow, and I would ask you to hold your questions until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| We have found by doing the slideshow and having some people to sit in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| oftentimes when you ask a question, the answer is coming in a couple of slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| So just bear with us, and we'll get through the slideshow and then take questions at the end, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| So I'll start by just talking a little bit about the A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Back in October, on October the 3rd of 2017, so almost two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| an award was made to BNA for $6 million to renovate the A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| And so they have been holding onto that award for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It's longer than we would prefer, but it is their award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| and they agreed to hold until we could try to relocate everyone that's in the A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| And so as you can see, their plan and what they submitted was for a 94-room boutique hotel with 75 condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=299)|
| 0:05:12| rooftop social space, as well as other various retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| So definitely a mixed-use facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Very nice. You can see some of the renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Total investment of $43 million into that facility, and that was numbers from over two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| So as cost of construction goes up, I think my colleagues over to my left will tell me those numbers probably go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| And so that goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| And we also look at economic impact to our community from that standpoint here in a few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=341)|
| 0:05:51| So going on to slide three, we started to meet over two years ago to look at relocation options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=351)|
| 0:06:01| And so we looked at, we think, around 12 sites, 12 sites from all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| from new construction on Knox County property, land acquisitions and new constructions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=370)|
| 0:06:19| buying a big box store and renovating that, existing office space that would be a renovation and expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=379)|
| 0:06:29| large campus occupation and renovation and reconfiguration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| If we've been asked about it, we probably have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| And what I would like to focus on today is more on what we are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| and not on the options that we did not choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| If you would like to contact me, we'd be happy to go over the other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| and what were the issues with those options and the price constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| or whatever it would be on why we didn't choose those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| We'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| But we know as we had to relocate the departments in the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| that includes the schools department or the Knox County Schools Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| Great Schools Partnership, the Knox County Probation Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Knox County Sheriff's Merit Office, and the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And so it's not just schools that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| It's a few other offices as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And so we looked at a number of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| And so why now and why there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Okay, really easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| We have a very rare opportunity to lease office space downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| at a really unbelievable lease rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| And so this negotiated rate is very appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| We know that the market lease rate for downtown now is about $15 to $18 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| And so to be able to stay downtown with our negotiated rate is part of what makes this deal so appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=486)|
| 0:08:17| Efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Modern and efficient space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| We go from the school system being chopped up on 15 or 16 floors to being on six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=501)|
| 0:08:32| They get very much efficiency and working with each other and modern, updated office furniture and space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=512)|
| 0:08:46| Market conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| So there's always been an appetite for people who wanted to acquire the A.J. building to put it back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| And so this option would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| So this puts the A.J. building back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| I would imagine that B&A will be asking for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| That would not be a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Everybody asks for pilots, and so I would expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| But once that pilot rolls off, then what happens is property tax revenue to not only Knox County but to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=556)|
| 0:09:26| And so there's additional revenue by having the A.J. back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| We'll talk about this in a few slides, but the school system in itself has an economic impact anywhere where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| And so keeping that downtown does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Moving them to a building that is not on the tax rolls currently, that does not take anything off the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| but puts them closer to Market Square to be able to go out for lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| while we transform the A.J. building into a mixed-use boutique hotel adds economic impact to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=600)|
| 0:10:11| If we have to borrow to do any portion of this project, the cost of borrowing is at an all-time low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=611)|
| 0:10:21| So we're about to go to market next week to issue bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and we expect probably one of the lowest fixed rates that we've ever come across, and so that's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=624)|
| 0:10:35| And I mentioned the lease rate compared to market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| And so it's really the best of both worlds for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| And I'm going to turn this over now to Mike Dooley from BMA to go over the next few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=646)|
| 0:10:58| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| The two things I'm going to talk about today are the East Tower and Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Those are the two buildings that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| And some of the benefits of those buildings are location, the parking and additional space with those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| the very efficient floor plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| As Chris alluded to, the Andrew Johnson building is multi-floor, smaller floor plates, so it's less efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| It's a very modern facility, and it's well-maintained by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| There will be enhanced security, and it's the lowest cost to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| As Chris alluded to, the opportunity for Knox County to purchase something below market value is very rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| so it's one of the first selling points of these two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| Having the school system remain in downtown at a central location is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| and with that we can sell other Knox County properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| TVA will be responsible and will maintain the East Tower through the duration of the lease, which is a big benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=708)|
| 0:11:58| TVA is already investing $10 million in the East and West Towers, which also includes some ADA work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| new ramps going down to Market Square, renovating the elevators, so the East Tower will have brand-new elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| So that is something that is not being paid for by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Workplace efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Having wide open floor plates allows you to design the space in a more collaborative environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| with more open office work systems, less offices, so we're looking forward to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| and we've been working with Knox County Schools for about a year or so on programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| so we've already laid out those spaces and have found that we've saved some square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| from what already is in the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Jane Burrett will talk about enhanced security coming up, provided by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| Okay, economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| A study was done that shows that the economic impact of keeping Knox County Schools downtown is $70 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| almost $71 million, and the potential impact of the A.J. Andrew Johnson Building sale is $68 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| So you can see there's a big benefit both with the city and the county to keep the school system in the downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| Okay, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Most of you know where the two towers are for TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| so if you're standing in Market Square, the east tower is the right tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| It's the smaller of the two towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Summer Place, you may not have noticed, but it's to the west of the west tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| It's bound by Walnut, Summit Hill Drive, and Summer Place Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| It's a garage, a five-story building, and then also has space underneath the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| and we'll talk a little bit more about the specifics of that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| You can see where the city-county building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| My office is on Market Square, so I have about a five-minute walk from my office to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| so we're just a little bit further up Market Square to give you an idea of the length of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| Okay, the east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| We've got some photographs here that show the current condition of the east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Again, it's a building that's in really good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Right now it's about 211,000 square feet for all 12 floors, and that's a plaza level up through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| We're looking at about 105,000 square feet for the relocation of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| into the plaza level through the sixth floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| This will be a 15-year lease term with five-year renewals for the total length of 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| and there is a first right of refusal built into the lease for the west tower if TVA vacates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| It also includes the Fritz parking lot, which is on Gay Street next to Tourism Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| and we will also be building a bridge and elevator to get services into and out of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| both for ADA and for building services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| So the photographs you can see, the top left view is from Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| so the tower on the right is the building we're talking about, the smaller of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| There's a shot to the right of that of some space on the plaza level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| The lower left picture is a typical floor plate of the office floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| So right now the space is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| We're going to go back in, remove the existing finishes, which is carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| We're keeping the existing ceilings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| We're going to repaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| TVA has already done some demolition work on all 12 floors of the core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| so we're going to have new toilet facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| The elevators, as I said, have been totally redone and are operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| So it's a really good, inexpensive way to go in and get high-efficient quality space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| without putting a lot into construction dollars as far as hard wall offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| and it should be quick, too, and efficient during the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=942)|
| 0:15:52| Now we're going to talk about the Summer Place building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| So you see that is from Walnut Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| So that is the building on the corner of Walnut Street and Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Behind it is the 700-space parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| So what we're calling the tower, the five-story building, is 35,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| The garage has 700 spaces, and there's two floors of space under the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| that are about 80,000 square feet, and then that backs up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| there's a loading dock on Summer Place Drive, which is directly behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| This is for the purchase price of $1.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| and there's also some yearly income associated with it on a lease with Digital Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| which remains in place, of $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And then the parking revenue will be about $95,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| Now we'll turn it over to Jane Burrett to talk about security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| Good afternoon. I'm Jane Burrett with the Public Building Authority, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Security has been a concern, I think, of a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| We manage with PBA the security for the city county building, Old Courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Andrew Johnson, Juvenile Justice, other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Can't compare it apples to apples with any one of those because it's under federal guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| but it's a much more secure level, which I don't think any of us are afraid of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| Andrew Johnson facility today, if you're a visitor, you'll come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| you'll share your driver's license or a state-authorized ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and then we issue you a temporary badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Then we notify the individual you're coming to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| and they can either come down and meet you or we can send you up if they approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| So we'll have the same setup for visitors at the TBA Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| In addition to that level, they'll just walk through the screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Their purse will be scanned, their bag will be scanned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| and they'll walk through the magnometer just to be screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| That's the only additional level there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Then they also background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| I think there was some question of that early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| PBA, we do background checks if you're a vendor of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| We will be managing the card access system for the tower, the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| and so we would do that the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| We don't do background checks on employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| We know that when City or County hires people, they are doing those themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| So the background checks, though, for vendors would still come through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and they would go through those same challenges that we face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| if any, on misdemeanor or felony, some of those counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Identification badges, those are just issued as you come into the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| again, with your driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| So the ID badges that speak to the employees, those will be assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| If you're an employee of the schools, you will come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| and we will issue those as we do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| We just have a form that your supervisor signs, and you're assigned a badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| which will give you access to either door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| You don't have to go through screening or anything further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| There is screening on the mail delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| which we would just get a typical screening machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| This is an added level of security we don't do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| I have done that at other federal buildings, and it's just a way to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| So we would do the screening at the summer place facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| and transport that mail over to the East Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| and then give it to the mail team there to distribute to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| School security officers, SSOs, or school resource officers, SROs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| and PBA officers are not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| They're not a – how do I say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| The best way to say it is they have not been a police officer or a sheriff's officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| So if they are that, they're post-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| These individuals have had a lot of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| but they do not have the level of training that a police officer or a sheriff's officer does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| and they don't have that post-certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| So they're not allowed to bring a weapon into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I have spoken to Gus Paducas, who is the chief of security for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| and we have talked about the fact that if they are post-certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| they could carry that weapon in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Some of his people are. He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| So those individuals would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| If we had an issue with someone that could not carry it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| we would arrange at the Summer Place facility to have a locked, secured box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| that once they got out of their vehicle, they could store their weapon there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| go into the tower, and when they leave, retrieve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| So not much – a little bit of inconvenience for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| but to follow the federal guidelines, that's what they need to do for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I'll turn it over to partners right now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Good afternoon. I'm Randy Jenkins, CFO at Partners Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| We've worked with the Public Building Authority in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| to analyze the potential relocation of Knox County School System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| not only for the dozen or so other options, but specifically for the TVA location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| So looking at this slide, we're talking about the estimated capital outlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| meaning what does it take to relocate the school system into that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| the school system and the associated other departments you saw on the previous slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| For that relocation, you're talking 9.975, and we're talking design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| we're talking the actual space changes inside those spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| and the FF&E, as well as some other associated cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| For Summer Place, that estimated capital outlay is 3.59 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| and then that is offset by the $6 million sell price of the existing AJ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| which would be an estimated net outlay of about 7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1331)|
| 0:22:21| In order to analyze an apples-to-apples comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| we had to look at what are the actual operating costs in the AJ currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| in comparison to those that are estimated in the TVA space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| And as you see there, the annual outlay at 708 per square foot in the AJ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| 885,000 per year, and in the East Tower, those are estimated at 840,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| or $7.93 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| And if you recall, I think it was Mike that was speaking to the efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| that are gained in the TVA space allows for that actual annual cost to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| even though the cost per square foot might be increased a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| it goes down because the efficiencies are found by locating the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| in the TVA building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| So we wanted to take a look at a 15- and a 40-year comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| 15 years being the base term of the initial lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| As you see there, the estimated cost of remaining in the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| would be slightly over $44 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| The estimated cost to move into the AJ, the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| along with the Summer Place acquisition would be $17.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| And then for, again, apples-to-apples comparison purposes, we wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| what if we just built a new building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| How would that compare to either of those options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And we estimate that 15-year cost to be slightly over $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| If the option periods were exercised that are built into the lease structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| we wanted to see what does that look like over a 40-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And as you see there, the estimated cost over that 40-year experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| in the AJ building is slightly over $116 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| In the East Tower, Summer Place location, slightly over $47 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| If we were looking at a newly constructed building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| we estimate that to be slightly or nearly $112 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1474)|
| 0:24:47| So some of the points that would, if we consider leasing versus owning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| some of the points that we as a developer or we as an advisor and consultant to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| would bring to bear would be the length of time to control the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| In a commercial market, it's a tug-of-war, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| between the landlord and the tenant over the landlord thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| I don't want to give up the space for too long because I may can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| market conditions may cause the rent to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| and so I don't want to give up too long of a control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| In this situation, having the 15-year term with the multiple five-year options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| puts you in a position to be able to control the location for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| The economics of the deal itself, per the previous slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| makes tremendous economic sense as far as just cost over the 15-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| or the 40-year period of time for this move to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| Tax benefits, if we were in a for-profit environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| if I was going out as an individual or maybe you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and thinking about owning versus leasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| it always comes into play depreciation benefits for a for-profit entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| become an enhancement to owning versus leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| In this environment, it's really the negation of that being a factor that impacts that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| This becomes one of the things that we think about not really being an impediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| to considering leasing a space for this period of time and occupying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And also the flexibility of there are a lot of buildings out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and the AJ may be taking a new chapter in its life that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| We think about normal time spans for usefulness of an asset, a building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| 40 to 50 years, it begins to usually need to change into another use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| or be imagined for another purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Those imaginings usually come with significant investments in renovations or refurbishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| If we think about the flexibility that that 15-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and all the way up to 40-year period time of controlling that space in the TVA space provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| then it gives you flexibility into the future so that you're not in another building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| that becomes obsolete or maybe inefficient just based on technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| and the way things function into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| And then per the slides we saw earlier, keeping Knox County School System downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| and then the economic impact of Andrew Johnson being converted into a mixed-use facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| provide tremendous impact on the CBID environment and the downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| So those were factors that also played into the thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| I think that gets you to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| What we want to do is just to give you the slides, show them, and let you all ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| We would encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| We've offered a few times, and some have taken advantage of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| of taking a tour of the East Tower and Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| We did two tours this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I think Virginia has done a tour, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| And TVA, which is some of their folks are here, they have been very accommodating to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| and allowing us to bring people through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| And so we'd love for you all to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| And we're open to holding additional meetings with you all individually or jointly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| whatever you all seem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| We just want to be very accommodating to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Our intention is we think contracts will wrap up this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| We will bring it to school board and commission in October and move from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| And so feel free to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| I'm seeing two lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I'm not sure whose light came on first, but the chair will recognize Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| Yeah, I had a question about the Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| You were talking about there's 700 parking spots in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| How many employees do we estimate between Knox County Schools, Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| you know, the whole entity that's presently in the AJ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Yeah, I think the number that we were given was 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| And so we have well more than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And so parking is not an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| and we have said that we're going to keep their rates the same rates as they pay currently at Dwight Castle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| So no change for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| All right, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Chris or Mr. Dooley, when we talked about the walking bridge from Summer Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| or we talked about a walking bridge, is there going to be one from Summer Place over to the Plaza for ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| I mean, I could imagine going down and back up the Plaza would be quite difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Yeah, currently there's not a bridge planned for Summer Place over to the Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| You're talking about going over Walnut Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| And along Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| We don't have plans currently for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| That's something that can be studied in the future if there's a need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| I think if we're parking the public over there and there's wheelchair access, I mean, to me it would be a difficult trek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| On the Fritz lot, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I mean, to me it would be a difficult trek across that grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| We also are going to have some ADA parking in the Fritz lot on the A Street side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| I'd say that will be pretty full most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| And also some additional parking at the on-grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay, Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I've actually got a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Just to go off of Commissioner Anders, how many public visitors do you usually have at the ADA building right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| It doesn't have to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| It's different each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I mean, on some days there's only maybe 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Some days you might have 30 or 40, but not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| So this is for Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| It was stated that there were six floors that were going to be occupied by the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| It's a 12-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Do we have anything in the pipeline for the additional six stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Are we going to sell the Sears building and move them over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Or is there other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| We have a few options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| So we have done some programming about how we could utilize the other six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| So that is an option that we have explored, which would allow us to potentially get Knox Central back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| and other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| We have been approached by a party to sublease those six floors, and so that could be very appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| And so I think right now we're just weighing our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| And so I think that's the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| So we do have a plan that we could use those other six floors for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| but there's also the opportunity to sublease those other six floors, which would offset some additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| You can come back to me at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| I've got a couple of questions here on your, I guess your third or fourth slide there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| You had the TVA is investing $10 million in the plaza, ADA and stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| Is it going to be broke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Now $5 million, $5 million, $9 million, $1 million, $8 million, $2 million between the two towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| or is it going to be split evenly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| From when I took the tour two years ago with the individuals out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| they told me all the things that had to be done to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| But they said the leasee would have to take care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| So how will that $10 million be broken down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| I can't really speak for how TVA is spending their $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| I know that there are some plaza renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| I know there is an egress that they have built out on Summit Hill, which is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| They have renovated all the elevators in the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| The cores of the bathrooms have been redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| The portion that we would maintain for us, all the ceiling tile and lights are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| So I think for us it's carpet and then what we're going to do with the FF&E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Okay, you mentioned the elevators again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| On that I was under the understanding when I took the tour that not all elevators will be open to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| to be used to those floors, only a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| The rest of it would be to the other floors that we would not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Well, that's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| We have all six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| If you have all six, that's fine, but that's what I was told when I first took my tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| They told you incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Okay, and then when we buy the parking, the summer place like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| will we have a full legal title to that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Yes, it's called a permanent easement, and it's more of a legal thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| but we own the garage and the permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| We just own the garage only part, nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| We own the garage and what's known as the tower and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| And we will have a legal document saying that we do own that through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| I think we can get a title on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Okay, and there was one other thing that I was going to ask here going over these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2079)|
| 0:34:51| I was wondering how many employees we're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| It says that we're going to save on salary and wages from the AJ building to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| How many school board people will we lose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| We're going from 226,000 to 42,513.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| How many employees will that affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| That's not employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| That's our operating cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| So that's our operating cost to run that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I know, but we're spending now on the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| We're spending that amount of money for the employees to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| So if we go to the other place where we're talking about 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and we're talking about a savings there, so is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| It's a savings because that money goes to O&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| So TVA provides O&M for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| and currently we pay some in salaries and wages for O&M of the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| and so we would not have that cost anymore at the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| So you would not have those employees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| They would not go with us, so you'd save employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| That looks like it's benefits to employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| Go ahead, Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Commissioner Buszler, I think what you're seeing there is those salaries are PBA employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| that their time is distributed to provide maintenance to the Andrew Johnson facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| So that's PBA employees only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Yes, and so our employees will not be doing maintenance at the TVA towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| but we would be handling security and just card access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| So how much of that, is that in that 42,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Yeah, it's custodial numbers, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| but the numbers that you're seeing on a salary reduction would just be PBA employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| that are no longer doing maintenance in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| and you're not losing employees because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We're just, we will not be working that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I also noticed that on there, the TVA O&M on that is $423,332.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2205)|
| 0:36:59| Is that yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Okay, and let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| On the contract, I have not seen the lease or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| Has the bonding council approved the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| Bonding council, as in what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| I've heard we have a bonding council that does our bonding for a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| So we have an attorney that we use for our bonds and financial stuff, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| We can get Tennessee title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| No, I mean has the contract been approved yet for the bonding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| Are we satisfied with the contract that we're going to go ahead and bond it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| We are currently still in contract negotiations that will be done by the end of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| and then at that point we will bring that forward to school board and commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| and then we will determine what amount we will bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and what amount we will pay with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Okay, when I went through the building, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I've got two more things and I'm through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| When I went through the building, I noticed that the building hadn't been used in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2295)|
| 0:38:24| At that point in time when I walked through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I think it had been vacated about 15 years before some of the floors had been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| They had used a couple of the floors on the bottom down there for conferencing for incoming TVA employees for training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| but the rest of the building had not been occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| What worries me about the contract with the federal government is they have a lot of guidelines for EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| for energy efficiency and things of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| and I noticed that the windows had not been improved to the standards that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| and there's some other things in there that they had changed the fire suppressants in one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| hadn't changed it in another, which is a big cost there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Will we be taking care of those upgrades and improvements in those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| No, that is all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| That is all part of our lease with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And the last thing, since it hadn't been used in some time, have they ever tried to lease it to anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2357)|
| 0:39:27| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| I'm sure they have tried to do things in the past, but the only thing that I'm worried about now is this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| The reason why I was asking that, it's such a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Why hadn't somebody taken it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Because there might be some other problems we have not foreseen in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| and that worries me a little bit there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I think our team has done a good job of looking at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| and we have looked at structural issues, and everything is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| And I think the reason that nobody has looked at this before is it truly only works for government to government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| And so there are certain things that we already do that a private company will not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| They will not do security like we have to do it by state standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| So I don't buy this piece that we say that nobody has went in there because the building is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| That's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| I'm just asking, you know, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| I'm just, I mean, we've got taxpayers' dollars here, and we're looking at spending millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| and I want to make sure that, you know, we do the best for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| The question there is I just want to make sure the contract does not get us in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| that we're being taken advantage of by the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| and they do have very strict leasing and guidelines in their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| I think we are fine, and I would just direct your attention to page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| If you want to look out for the taxpayers of Knox County, the best option is the East Tower and Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| It's by far better than staying in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Could I have one other thing, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Could you send me the list of the 12 other sites that were looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| I will share those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because I have a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| but I think the summary of the information that was provided, I think I need an opportunity to really look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| My question is within a, because we seem like we've made a decision, in a 45-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| where is the conversation regarding what the public needs to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| or a period where the public needs to comment on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Where are those discussions as we begin to present information to bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| that we have not had an opportunity for the public to say how those dollars should be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| Well, I think our job for the public is to make the best financial decisions for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| and that's what we're presenting to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| For the public, there's no difference from going into the A.J. building than going into the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| Well, I'd like to hear the public say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Commissioner Gill, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| First, regarding visitors, does that number of visitors to the A.J. building only count those who sign in as visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| or does it also count those who are district-wide employees who may badge in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| That's only visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I mean, we would maintain the badging for the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| so if you have someone today that's visiting the schools regularly, they would obtain an employee badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| If it's a visitor, actual physical, that's what I was counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| They are coming to the front desk and signing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| So do we currently have any way to count how many actual visitors we have to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| so we can tell how many have actually badged in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| And I can get you that information and share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| And that would include school board members and folks like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| My other question is, I guess, for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| We keep talking about gaining space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| That's what I've heard all this time, is that we're going to have better space and more space and more flexible space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| But it looks to me like we're losing over 19,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| So I'm a little confused, because that's a space cost of over $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| So it's efficiency of space, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| And so, actually, when we programmed the schools for the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| they actually just needed five and a half floors of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| And so now we're saying, I think we've talked to Mr. Roswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| and we've renovated, not renovated, but we've redone some of our numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| and have increased that to six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| I think you have to see the floor plates of the East Tower versus the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| The A.J. building is so cut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| That is the most inefficient space for office space we could have ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| And so I think the reason, I see what you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| but if you see just square plates of empty floor, it's much more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| And so that's why you actually see a decrease in total space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| It's a more efficient space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| I guess I need some clarification on how it's more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| I haven't seen anything that shows me that our office space would be arranged in a way that is that much better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| because some of our floors right now, the way they're divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| very purposefully keep things away from other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| So I would encourage you to take a tour with us, and then we can show you our layout by the floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| Like for Mr. Roswick, it's an opportunity to get C&I actually on two floors, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| instead of, what do you own now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| 4, 4, 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| And so more collaborative, more efficient space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| And does that draw people in from our outbuildings also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Some, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Or are they still in those other outbuildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| So we bring in school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| What else were you bringing in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| But the program number for Montesquieu schools is under 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| So keep in mind, the program, thank you for saying that, Kristen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| The program number, so you're looking at 125 for the total A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| The school's piece of that is under 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| So they are getting more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| So the whole A.J. building is 125,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| but the school's piece of the A.J. building is a little under 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| I guess I need to see that a little more clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| because so far the only thing I've heard that's more efficient is lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Next, by the way, Ms. Babb, I know your light is on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| but you were also the first one to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| so I'm going to get back to you after we've had a chance to get to everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| Ms. Chrissy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2780)|
| 0:46:31| She don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Sorry, I was looking over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I thought I saw the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Mr. Caldwell, I know we have a contract for $6 million on the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Is that at current value today, do you think, at A.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Is it $6 million, or do you think it might be more like $8 million or $9 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| No, I think it's current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| I think $6 million is what we feel is a realistic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Actually, Matt Myers, who's here back there, we actually had this discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| In two years, I know that building values have went up downtown, but so has construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| And so if you looked at the bids that came in on the A.J. building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| and how the winning bidder priced and got $6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| and what the second place per person was, I think if you put it back out for bid today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| you may actually get less instead of more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| The goal is to get A.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| The current goal was, or maybe still is, to get the A.J. on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| If the new owners do not get a pilot, will this kill the deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| I think it's a question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I think it's up to them to bring a pilot request before county commission and city council and or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| And so I don't want to really answer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| It's a good question for them because it's kind of hard to agree to a pilot for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| when we're trying to get this back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| You mentioned a minute ago about going to market next week for bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Are these bonds for this move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| No, this was the bonds that you approved last month at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| I wanted to clarify that because I didn't think you were jumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| We would never take anything to market without you all approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Just to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Bear with me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| It says TVA is responsible for the maintenance of the facility's grounds of the east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| That's everything outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| We'll be responsible for everything on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| No, they were responsible for everything, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Not the custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| We have custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Well, it's custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| But all HVC, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Bear with me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| I made myself notes or highlighted as I went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| Mr. Biggs has already asked this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| It was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| What happens to the other six floors and that Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| That is a very good question that we need answered, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| I agree with Commissioner Gill that the public does need to know, have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| I'm not sure what page it is, but it says estimated net operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| AJ building in a 15-year comparison is $44 million compared to $17 million for the east tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2970)|
| 0:49:40| How is the AJ building costing $44 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| It's costing, for the last 15 years, has the AJ building cost us $44 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| No, that's 15 years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Well, the future, the past is the future, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| So we can look at the past and see what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| And I will ask the superintendent and all those to give me those numbers of what that building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| But $44 million compared to the 17, that's a big number, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Where did that number come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| So here's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| So if you're going to stay in the AJ building, the schools are going to say, and they have told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| we need renovated modern space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| So to do that, that number is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| So if you're staying in the AJ building, you've got to make it more modern and efficient for office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| It's not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| That building is not meant for offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| That statement you made, that's the first time I've heard that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| So I would like to hear that statement from the superintendent or the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| I would like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It looks like Mr. Oaks is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Do you want to answer that question now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3051)|
| 0:51:07| What we have said in our discussions with representatives from the county and Barbara McMurray is to remain in the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| And I'm not taking a position on whether we stay in the AJ or whether we move somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| But if we're going to stay in the AJ over time, we need to look at the space and how the space is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| We've got some areas that are inefficient, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| My biggest concern is we currently run two dispatch operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| We run a transportation dispatch operation and we run a 24-hour dispatch operation for our security office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| One is located in the Knox Central building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| The other is located in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| They both need to be in the same place in order to get maximum efficiency and effectiveness for our security operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| and our transportation operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Those two entities need to work hand in glove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| And right now they do the best they can, separated by a mile, mile and a half of territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| And the other piece, as you go back and look at, is we're constantly juggling space within the building as people come and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3135)|
| 0:52:24| and as there are reorganizations and as we reduce our footprint in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| and maybe increase our footprint in another area, the office space is not conducive to those kinds of moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| So I think we need to look within and determine how best to use what space is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| and if there needs to be some redesign in order to make it more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| and to accommodate more of our staff within the AJ's footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3174)|
| 0:53:04| So we're looking, if we remodel the AJ building, we're looking at $44 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3184)|
| 0:53:14| No, sir, I can't say that because I don't know what a remodel would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| That hasn't even been studied and we haven't determined what the requirement would be if we were to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| But it would certainly be something that would need to be done over the next 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| That's one thing that I would request from Mr. Caldwell, just try to get that number going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| It's about $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| So $15 million of the $44 million, I believe, was the number for the renovation of all 17 floors of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| Mr. Oaks, you said that the two security offices, could you move the one from the AJ building to the central building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| That is not the ideal solution because that security, what's in the AJ is our transportation dispatch operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| That transportation dispatch operation also serves as our emergency operation center nucleus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| If we have an issue where we have to fall in and establish an emergency operation center, it's where our people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3248)|
| 0:54:17| If we move that over, I'm separating it from the rest of the transportation operation and it needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| So really, if you're going to put them together, you can't put them together in the central building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| They need to be put together in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I want to give you an opportunity to speak, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| But, you know, there's still some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| And you and I had a short conversation the other day about this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| And there's still a lot of questions I think that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| I don't think 45 days may not be long enough to answer some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| We'll soon find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| But I'm going to give you an opportunity, if you want to answer the same question that Mr. Oaks did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| Do you feel that we need this move now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| I'll just say there's probably a place somewhere where we could operate more efficiently than where we're operating right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| But we've made it work for 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| I don't think that, as far as I'm concerned, we can make it work for, I won't be here, but another 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| So I appreciate all the work everybody's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| I haven't been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| And I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I was here when we were here and moved across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| When that building was purchased and that Kessel garage was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| it was built for our employees because we had people that couldn't park over here and they were paying $60 and $70 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| So Earl Huffmeister and Dwight Kessel worked out this deal in 1991, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| And we have spent, based on the capper, we have spent $25.6 million to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| So if the county wants to give us $25.6 million for what we spent out or give us ownership of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| I mean, we paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| We paid the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| We paid the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| We paid the debt on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| If you want to move us, I am not part of that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| The board and the commission will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| You know, give us, I think we are operating, our space cost is $688,000 a year over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| So put that back in our budget and don't take anything away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Give us the growth, property tax and sales tax growth, and pay our rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| You know, if you want to do that, hey, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| So you feel that the A.J. building could still be utilized for the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| Well, you know, it was purchased for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| I heard the numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| I don't know what's behind those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| How long before Knox County gets anything off of that building when it's renovated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| You know, what is that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| What do the schools get out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| So, I mean, I haven't been privy to any of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| and hardly any of the conversation throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Kind of brings up a question, why weren't you involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| You know, that's, in my mind, that's not, you know, why weren't you involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| You're the superintendent of Knox County Schools, the, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| top 50 school districts in the United States, number-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| And why weren't you involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| So that's, you know, that brings up a red flag to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Especially since we're paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I did take the time earlier this week and take the tour of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| Ms. Babb, I believe you've been over there to see it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| And truly, that speaks louder than anything that has been said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| Just, I mean, I came into this really feeling like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| it was the prior administration that felt like we, wanted us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| And my attitude from day one has been, you know, we'll make it work wherever you put us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| And I still feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| But I will tell you, after going over and looking at the TVA towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| that is a significant, significant upgrade as compared to what we are doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| Again, I hope that you'll go see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Mr. Besser, I think you said it had been like two years ago that you were over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Well, I don't know what it looked like then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| But right now, there is nothing, when you walk into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| that gives any indication that it has not been used or dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| I mean, it's totally, totally modern feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Bathrooms have all been gutted and are much more ADA accessible than the AJ is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3543)|
| 0:59:12| Talking about accessibility, there's no worse building in this world to try to get into than the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| And I can't imagine if you had a disability because it's just not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| So I will say that access over there, and I'm no expert on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| but on the service, access appears to be much, much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3570)|
| 0:59:39| Another thing that I was not aware of until I went over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| and I wish that you would address, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| is I understand that there's going to be room for the, for Knox Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| our old Sears building, to also come into that facility, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| and therefore that will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| So there is room in Summer Place in the building piece, which is on the ground floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| that could be used for records and the school warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| And then there's all that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| There is what they call the Summer Place Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| which is about 35,000 square feet of office space that could be used for general offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| that are over at Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| So it does give us the ability to put Knox Central on the tax roll if so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| So that is a piece that has really been factored in yet that you might look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3633)|
| 1:00:43| Where will savings go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3643)|
| 1:00:57| Your mic is off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3658)|
| 1:01:06| Well, as far as efficiency goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| one thing that really struck me, Ms. Owen, when I went there, is the openness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| And when you get off of each level and go out into this vestibule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| on both sides there are doors that is an additional layer of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| but still totally has the separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| So it was very easy to envision different departments being in different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| So I very much liked the feel of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| If this is something that we do, we, the school system, are not going to be worse off for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| I can assure you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| So please take the tour and have a good look at what the potential is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I really just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I think all the rest of them have been asked already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Chris, I want to talk about the $15.6 million figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| I don't know what page number this is, that was used as a renovation cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| So where did that derive from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| We used $125 a square foot times the square footage of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I guess this question might be for Mr. Oaks or possibly Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| Could a $15.6 million renovation increase the working capacity of the A.J. building to any degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3751)|
| 1:02:53| Commissioner, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I don't know how to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| You'd have to wait until all the analysis was done and you actually had a plan to put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| So I really couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| I've got a brief question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| And then we're at a point now where I see some other folks who'd like to weigh in with another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| And this will be your second question, so I'll start getting back to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| But, Chris, just real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| This is a government-to-government move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| You've got a building that's off the tax rolls, moving into a building that's off the tax rolls, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| So would any revenue, which makes a pilot question somewhat interesting because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| you're not starting with a tax base already on that building because it's been off the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| but would any revenue that could come with it going back on the tax roll really at any level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| would that revenue not be incremental in and of itself for any revenue to come up from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| I guess I'm trying to get to the point of incrementality in terms of the revenue boost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| You're talking about off the A.J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| That's probably the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Yeah, and so I think, you know, we had the chamber to provide that economic impact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| so that number can grow over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| That wouldn't factor in hotel-motel and sales tax and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| So I think that number can grow over time incrementally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| As I'm getting back to a few folks, I also want to make a, for everyone in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| and for everyone up here, the school board does have a meeting that starts tonight at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| and we do want to make sure that we conclude this work session in time for them to do some prep going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| So with that said, Mr. Biggs, you weighed in early on this, and you asked me to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| Is now a good time for me to come back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| I think Ms. Babs' lot was on before mine, if you'd like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| But I could go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| You and Ms. Babs were the first two that I wanted to get back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| So just a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| So we've heard from everybody or the majority of everyone talking about looking 15 to 40 years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| We know that commission, we've heard of several different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| So looking into the future, just as government as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| we know that we're facing a $30 million pod that might have to be built for the jails, maybe two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| so that would be $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| We know that we're talking about millions of dollars to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| or to move from the A.J. building over to the tower at the TVA tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| So why are we not looking at something that we could house multiple government agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| if we're talking about security issues and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| where maybe we could save some money right now to have something that we would have to invest in later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| and that could basically give us more bang for our buck for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| I can go in more depth if you want, if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| You want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Well, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| I mean, if it's a specific location that you're getting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| I think we did explore a number of options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| some options that was a lot more square footage than what we could use ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| We never found that parcel to be for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| And so here's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| If we're looking 40 years in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| this building sits on one of the most beneficial pieces of property in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Obviously, we see the benefit of the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| Why don't we sell them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Why don't we move out to East Elm Mall and occupy that with city, county, government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| as well as the courts, as well as the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Everybody would be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| There's adequate parking out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| In that area right now, there's restaurants around it, and it could benefit from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| I see the downtown of Knoxville is on the rocket ship of success, I guess is what you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| and the lunch crowd that would be served there, which is what Ms. Owen was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| would be beneficial for third party to come in and purchase this building as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| the A.J. building, and maybe somebody moving to the TVA tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Maybe the East Elm building is not up for sale, but I would just like your input on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| Where do you see us as a government as a whole moving in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| knowing that we're going to have to address the jail overcrowding issue as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| To answer your question, Knoxville Center is not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| We did have some conversations early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| They offered to lease us space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| It wasn't anything that was appealing to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| And so I think as far as this building goes, there's two tenants in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4058)|
| 1:07:46| It's city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I think ultimately both have to decide if this is the right place for them or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| or if they want to go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| I don't think that conversation, I think people talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| but I don't think right now it's a piece at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| and so it costs a lot of money to build a new city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| I'm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| The reason I ask that is because I know that East Elm is delinquent on their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| and I know that they've just become current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| but I know there's other properties that are owned by the same group, and they are delinquent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Maybe they might be a repeat offender, but I just wanted to get your input on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| because I didn't know if maybe we're looking to something in the future that we're going to have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| and why not make this opportunity to consolidate everybody into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| That was one of our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Thank you, Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Yes, I go along with Terry Hill that if you have not toured the TVA building, I would suggest doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| I did it, and this is not to weigh in whether one is better than the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| but also if you have not toured the AJ building, I think it behooves you to do that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| because I think it will show why if we stay in the AJ building, something's got to be done at that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| It is not efficient at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I mean, it's an old hotel that has been made into office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| So for those of you who have not seen either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| I think you really need to tour either one and go actually up in the floors of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| But my question is concerning Summer Place, I just didn't hear much about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| There was talk about $3.5 million for Summer Place, and I know a lot of us parking a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| What exactly is $3.5 million for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I think that number is $1.6 million for the purchase, and then we have some renovation costs in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| So we have to do some remediation to the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| We have to purchase a chiller and do some HVAC work and so things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| That's what gets that number to $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| And one other question is should this, and once again this is not on whether we should do it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| but should the TVA be decided on, what is the time length we see on once we've decided to do something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| to actually moving people out of the AJ building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| So I think part of it, timing is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So we know in talking to school officials that there's a lot of things that need to be moved in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| when there's no kids in class and when we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| And so part of the reason we're thinking about October was we believe it's a push,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| but it gives our team the ability to at least get far enough along to get certain departments in in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| and then finish up with other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| And so it's more of an occupancy thing because we know that summer is ideal for a move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Someone from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| PBA recently did an addition to State Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| How many parking spaces was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| I'll let you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Kristen, it was her project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| That was about 550.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| What was the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| 500 spaces at $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Summer Place has 700 spaces, can be purchased for 1.6 and renovated for a total of 3.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| and comes with an additional 35,000 square feet of office space plus 80,000 square feet of also usable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4282)|
| 1:11:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| That's a pretty good deal on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Chris, in your numbers, I don't believe you factored in expenses or revenues for the possibility of leasing the other six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| I think you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| So we did not put in the revenue from the top six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| They would cover their renovation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| They'd cover the renovation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| They would also pay us a lease rate greater than our lease rate and also cover their O&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| And also in this there is the potential for a first-ride refusal on the West Tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| I think it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| And so as we went through contract negotiations, I don't think legally that can be put into a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| But I think TVA is planning on staying in Knoxville for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| And so I don't think they're going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| But if they were to choose to move, then I'm sure we would have conversations about the West Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4351)|
| 1:12:40| How occupied is the West Tower by TVA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| I don't want to answer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| I think about 80 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Is that 90 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Has TVA looked for other locations to relocate their employees here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| I don't think TVA has looked to relocate out of the West Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| They're putting a lot of money into that campus currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| If we were unable to lease the top six floors, we do have programming that we could use for our staff and employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Have we looked at the numbers of the savings that that would generate from the efficiencies of the building there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| and going there and also the revenues generated from any buildings that we could surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| There's an upfront cost that would be to renovate those six floors and to make space for Knox County departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4409)|
| 1:13:41| So the upfront number would be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| But what it does do is it frees up space here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And so if you've never been to the CCB and walked around and tried to find empty space, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4427)|
| 1:13:55| Because ultimately it's a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| I think through our programming efforts, if you talk to the DA, she would tell you she needs space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| If you talk to the sheriff, he's going to tell you he needs space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| If you talk to about anybody, I think our building codes department is in space that's about half the size of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4448)|
| 1:14:21| And so I think this building is cramped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| And so it's just, you know, there is advantages of us taking those top six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Moving back to Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| I was really going to comment on kind of what Randy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| I mean, this could be potentially a break-even proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| The numbers that you're putting up there, if we move to TV-8s, it could be a break-even proposal over the first ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| I mean, depending on your lease rate that we get on those top six floors, if we sublease, I mean, you could really do really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| There could be some synergies that you want to give a break on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I think it's ultimately, you know, what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| But your point is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I think to have the ability on those top six floors to either accommodate us as far as space goes to alleviate some crowding here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| or to move forward with a sublease is appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| The chair recognizes Commissioner Busler, and then we'll move to Ms. Elwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| So what you're saying is, is the building, we're just not doing the sixth floor, but we have use of the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| We can use it as we see fit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| But we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| We're just doing the first six floors, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| No, I think everything that we showed you from a cost perspective was apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| It was just the first six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Okay, Mr. Thomas, can I ask you a question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4547)|
| 1:15:56| We have heard, we have talked before, you and I have talked different things about the number of buildings the schools have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| and the county has together and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| And one of the things we mentioned before, you said if we could have everything in one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| it would be very good for the school and school board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| I believe that conversation dealt with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| I said if we could have larger schools, larger schools are more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| More efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| But if you combine your central office with your other facilities that you have out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| like your maintenance department and everything else in one location, would that be an optimal thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| I believe any time you could get all of our operations on one site, then it would be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Here's what it looks like to me on this 40-year deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| It says in 40 years we're going to spend probably a lot more than that, but it looks like $116 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4608)|
| 1:16:58| We have some spaces that are not right downtown, but close to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| that we could probably put everything that you want to do on one location for the school board, transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| You'd have bus services and things like this on things that the school already owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| Would that be optimal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| I think, again, the answer is if you could get all of our operations like maintenance, security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| and central office all on one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| But you don't have to be on Market Square, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| No. Access to the interstate would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| If you could find a place where your parking was not fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| where people could come to some of your meetings without having to pay parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| and could get there through bus services and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| would that be better for the public and the taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| It would be, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| Okay. We have that option, and we need to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| In 45 days we can look at some other options, too, I think, that we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| So that's just my opinion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| And I would like for Ms. Hill to have an option here to say we can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Why don't we build it what you need it to work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Could we not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| And you're talking about security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| I'd like to see if we could do some things that we could make more security in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| I think as adults you all could protect yourself enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| but I'd like to see more money spent in the schools for security, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| And I think there's ways that we can do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| So we'll enjoy working with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| All right. Thank you, Mr. Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I'm going to go to Ms. Owen, and then Commissioner Daley, your light's coming back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I'm going to ask a small favor to keep it relatively brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| With all respect for our partners at the school board, their meeting starts in about 12 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| So I know they'll need some transition time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Go ahead, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you. I just have some clarifying questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Regarding the cost totals that we have here, in just those first six floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| that is only Knox County Schools that's in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| So it does not include any of those other offices like the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| or the Probation Office or the Merit Office or the PDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| Great Schools is in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| So Great Schools Partnership is in the six floors that we have programmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| The others we don't feel, from a programming standpoint, fit in that mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| Okay. So Great Schools is in that first through sixth floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Do any of these numbers also include any of the other satellite offices that we've talked about including,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| like Knox Central or the security or any of the costs of leaving transportation in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| What I'm wondering is we talked about moving Knox Central there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| Does this include the cost of that, or would that 35,000 square feet be an additional cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| No, the 35,000 would be additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| What we wanted to do in this presentation was keep it apples to apples for school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4792)|

| 1:20:02| My question is to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| How close are we on the contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Is the contract to be done by the end of September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4807)|

| 1:20:25| As far as a time frame, I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the negotiations with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| As Mr. Caldwell stated, it is still under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| I'm sorry, negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4835)|

| 1:21:26| They're kind of broken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190911?start=4886)|
