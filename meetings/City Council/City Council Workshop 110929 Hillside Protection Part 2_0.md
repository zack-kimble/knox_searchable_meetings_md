| 0:00:00| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| When we get into a debate on a subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=5)|
| 0:00:08| to me it doesn't matter where the information comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| I look at the information and I look at the explanation of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| and I can say, okay, this person evidently knows what they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=14)|
| 0:00:18| or they don't know what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=18)|
| 0:00:20| We have two or we've got really four different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| We've got the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| We've got Councilman Della Volpe's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| We've got Tony's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Now we've got Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| So we're going to have to sometimes sit down and put four of them side by side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| and pick one of those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| It doesn't matter who made that suggestion, but it's picking the one out of that four that's going to be the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| for everybody concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| I have a question, Mr. McAdams, on the project by project review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| The MPC plan calls for MPC to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| Your plan asks that codes administration and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| Are you saying that MPC should be taken totally out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| or are you saying MPC along with codes and engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| I just need clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| MPC would continue to play the role that it currently plays in reviewing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| And that is for projects within plan zones, they would continue to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| For projects requiring development plan approval, they would continue to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| And the engineering and codes departments would continue to review what they currently are reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| in addition to these other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| Today when you go for a grading permit, you go to the engineering department, not to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| And these are primarily grading and clearing issues that are being reviewed today by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| No change in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| It's not sending something that MPC was reviewing over to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| Everybody continues to review what they were reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| And engineering would get the additional scrutiny on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| It also is subject to the state permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| which has erosion control measures that have to be applied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| But MPC would continue to play its traditional role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| It proposed a new role for itself, which was that let's put everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| when something comes up for rezoning or land use review that's over 15 percent, let's put it in a plan zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| and we'll review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| And instead it stays where it always has been in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| A question for Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| One of the things that does concern me in reviewing the plan is that you talk, especially talking about the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| What was the rationale for zero to 30 percent, 100 percent clearing as opposed to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| Let me get the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And while you're looking that up, it seems to me, Commissioner Brown, that you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| that we've got Tony's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| We've got Nick's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| We have this Plan B in front of us as well as the regular or the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| And it seems to me that it's not a matter of picking one over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| To me, what it is is to pick the best points out of each plan and try to put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| And so that because I believe that whether it's Tony's comments or Nick's or the Chamber's or MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| that what we're all looking for is the best possible plan to protect not only our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| but the ridges and the hilltops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| I'm concerned about one of the things that I would like to see explored further is, of course, the views that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| that the Chamber does talk about in the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| I may have missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| But it seems to me that, really, from what you're saying, that we really do have pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| and parts out of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| And it seems to me that possibly the group that ought to relook at that is probably MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Because it's my understanding, I think, and I'll ask the Chairman, that if there are any amendments made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| that it does have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| But if we take these four and pick the parts, as you said, Dwayne, that fit, we're going to have number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=255)|
| 0:04:25| which we could send back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| But it's the best plan that incorporates all of the best things out of all four of them and puts it into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| The 100% clearing actually came out of the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| The MPC proposes 100% clearing in the zero to 15% slope range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| And what Plan B did was to take that same concept but to increase it from zero to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| That was consistent with the engineering review that indicated that at 30% is where you really begin to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| significant change that developed in rolling hill communities like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| It's fairly standard development subject to existing regulations that have worked in the zero to 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| But where is the point that special scrutiny is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| And so that's where the extra requirements kicked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| The chamber fully supports the adoption of a tree plan by the county, the tightening up of the city tree plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=322)|
| 0:05:31| additional planning requirements on slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Totally in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And I think it's appropriate to include that in your tree ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| and in your codes and regulations rather than in a vague general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| I guess what I was asking, you said that engineering, how did you folks come up to, say, zero to 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| I didn't quite understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| I mean, was this something that, where did you come up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| The 30% slope mark was what the engineers determined was the point at which a project really needed special scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| Who were the engineers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Vatsenheim and Norvell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Okay, that's what I want to be clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And that was based on their experience in many steeply sloped projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Okay, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| As far as the plan B aspect, again, I haven't thoroughly looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| And we do have some people that have and have some comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| We didn't really intend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| I think there should be adequate time for us to do an analysis of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| and its effect and variation from our original plan and our amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| I think Mr. Donaldson could probably speak to some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I don't know whether he wishes to do that today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| I know he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| I think that, to me, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| it's reasonable to assume that there are some good things in possibly within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| But certainly if there are and we adopt the plan or some version of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| say we adopt the plan with our amendments in it, there is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| there's opportunity for us always to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| This is a process that we do all the time whenever we have a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| And that process will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| I consider this particular effort by the chamber as a tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| It's a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| It's a diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| And it's an effective diversion if we go down the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| which we've already started down by allowing the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| and then the questioning of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| So we're starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| And in doing that, we are negating the work of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| We're negating the work of the facilitated sessions that we've already participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| Now we have another version that's coming up and we're supposed to adjudicate that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| And I object again to that as being part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| We're not negating any of them in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| What we're saying now is we're going to try to pick the best from each and put it together in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Anybody have any council members, commissioners have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| If you do wish to speak, turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Yes, I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| The choosing of the 30% standard that Mr. McAdams just spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| and you said that you had used your engineers or people within the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| and that it was about 30% where above that is when you started having significant problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| That's not what I've heard in these workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| We've had people who have come up several times and I specifically have asked them pointedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| is there a problem between the slope between 50% up to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| And we've had people from the University of Tennessee, from different schools of ecology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| who have many years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| And they've said from that podium, from direct questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| there is significant problems between above 15% with runoff, flooding, clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| And so I just don't want the people here to get the impression from what you said, from your engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| that the problems only start above 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Because that is not what I've been hearing from this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| Well, if you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| You remember what Gary Norvell said a while ago, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And each of you have said in cases where that one month it goes one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| six months later it goes another way because of the topography of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Each piece of ground in this area is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| And to have a rigid, hard, fast document that says A equals such and no more and B and so forth, you cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=621)|
| 0:10:31| You have to look at each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| It might be that a 15% is not, you know, totally clearable because of the problems, the way it lays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| the way it would affect, you know, downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| But at the same token, we might even have a 30% or 40% that the way it lays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| and everything maybe it runs straight into the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| You know, you have to take each piece and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| So you can't have one blanket rigid rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| It has to be a rule of thumb or this is a plan to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| But plans, as Tony mentioned a while ago, all these things are adjustable and amendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Well, you know, I agree with quite a bit of what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| And what I have argued for here is that if we are creating a vision statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| with some general areas that have to be regulated like percent of clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| or just the idea of clearing and how much slope to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| we've got to do it in a way that gives us enough flexibility both to prepare ordinances downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| that might be different than the general approach in a vision type document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| And secondarily, that we have that safety valve that always should exist in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| which is when you get to the specific facts that Mr. Brown was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| it might be that a particular track because of the type of the soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| because of the way it lays, because of where the water courses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| because of the quality of the engineering on solving problems that needs to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And we should have that flexibility as legislators to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| I mean, that's why our whole legal system has general statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| and then courts when people disagree on how it applies in a particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| So as long as we adopt a plan that gives us the flexibility to make carefully fine-tuned decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| I think we're in good shape and I would support, you know, going forward with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Vice Mayor, now that we have had our public forum and facilitators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| and so that the public will know what will be our next steps in this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| That's exactly where we need to go is next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| Chairman Hammond, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| I was going to suggest Mr. Hill has asked to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| and I think he deserves the opportunity to do so, if that's okay with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| to give him the opportunity to have his five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| I apologize for not being here on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I was behind a two-lane wreck on a four-lane highway out on I-40 East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| Our first responders were handling that with efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| And, fortunately, I got here a little too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| My name is Robert M. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I live in Farragut, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| I've been a resident of Knox County for, well, since 1954.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| I'm a professional engineer by trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| having been in engineering for 61 years and been a professional engineer in this state for about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| I also am here on behalf of the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| I'm the group chairman for the Harvey Broom Group of the Sierra Club in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| And you heard Mr. Ringo say that we represent around 1,000 people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| We also represent the same people that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| All of you are put here to represent a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| As you notice when you go through your redistricting, you will represent all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| and not just some special groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| All of those 400,000 people are without a part of being they're not part of the power structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Neither am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| And I get five minutes and the power structure gets 15 or 20 for its half-time diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| But, nevertheless, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Our club likes the plan as it was originally written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| We want to commend you all for having the facilitated discussion between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| And that discussion, I think, was focused on the things that bothered you all about the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| that we were discussing and have been discussing for the last almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| So we've gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Some changes, I'm sure, will come out of that discussion, as they should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| because laws are made by compromise and you have to have give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| That was the give and take part of the exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| So I'm pleased that you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| I think you had a good facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And I think it was beneficial to both bodies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| I will say that I'm sorry that Commissioner Broars left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| But Commissioner Broars had with her two of her children, who are really the people that you're looking at in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=955)|
| 0:16:05| terms of the vote that you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| We want to leave Knoxville and Knox County as a great place to live, work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| and play for future generations and not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| It's not about profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| It's not about land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| It's not about intensive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| It's about whether it's a nice place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| This plan, I believe, goes a long ways to solving some problems that we've all seen in spades in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| namely drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| It will also serve to protect the environmental beauty and just the natural beauty of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| It's the area that attracted me because of its beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| I grew up in Alabama where it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| I don't like flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I like hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| We've got them, and they're pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| So when you think about the changes that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and the plan that's before you and has been before you for years, remember that it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| It's your vote for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| And the future of this kind of exercise in planning is always subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| You never know exactly how it's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| But if you do it right and if you do the best you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| and I think this committee that developed this plan did the best they could in developing a plan that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| for Knox County, then you can expect some good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| You don't have to worry about the outcome as being a special purpose outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| It is an outcome that fits the land, and that's what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| So when you vote on this and when you get your ideas together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| remember that this is for all of Knox County, and it's not for next week or next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| It's for generations from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| It's always an honor to speak to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Having been a member of this group myself for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| I'm always pleased to be here whenever I have an opportunity to be a relevant speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| So thank you very much and have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| In terms of next steps, Mr. Donaldson, I'd like to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I'll throw this out, and I'd like to preface it by saying that I've been through probably about nine of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| public meetings, council meetings, discussions, workshops, joint workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| And I think it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I appreciate all the people's interest and input in coming out, and I like to see the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| And I think from the city council standpoint that that's been our trademark for the last number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| that we've had dialogue and discussion and public input, and that's integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| And we've done this all out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And so we're now to the point where we have to figure out what's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| And, you know, in terms from my standpoint, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| further consideration of what's been proposed by Mr. Donaldson, you and Commissioner Norman mentioned last meeting we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:32| that the plan, the original plan, needed work was what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| We have Councilman Della Vopi has come together with a plan with some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| Commissioner Norman has some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| We have the plan B now that's come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| And I wanted to ask you from a time standpoint, if we ask you to go match up all the things that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:06| and to incorporate the city staff and the plans that have been submitted out there that are public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| how long would it take the NPC to go back and put together a, call it a modified plan, call it a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:25| a plan that incorporates in areas of agreement and, you know, from the facilitator and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| I mean, could we do this by the latter part or could you do this like in the next three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| Three weeks may be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Certainly a month would be much more comfortable because we, you know, this has gone on a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:59| long time and some of us don't have much more time on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| and we'd certainly like to see, you know, this happen and, you know, we started, we'd like to see it finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| But I guess having heard that, I'd like to hear comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I know some are strictly opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| But would that be something that we would like to see as a consideration of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| creating some type of new plan incorporating what's been presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| And if you'd like to comment, turn your light on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| My only question is, do they need a little more guidance from what we like and what we don't like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| There's obviously a catch bag of stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| What do they do in the back room when they try to moderate all these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| I mean, it seems like they need some guidance from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| These are the three or four points we think you should hit or not hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| But I don't know how we do that, whether we just do that by discussion and a vote or what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| I think, you know, you presented yours in a fashion that's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| Commissioner Norman and Mr. Donaldson, who worked on the original plan, know what changes they might make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| And the plan B is it's lined up side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| So I don't think that's that difficult to comprehend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Well, I guess what I was suggesting is that there might be parts of it that in each or every one of them that this group likes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| or doesn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| And I'm not sure that if I were MPC, I would come back with anything other than I've given you my best shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| What do I do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Well, I think it's all a good faith effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| And, you know, it's, you know, to me, as a councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| I'm trying to chair the meeting and move this along to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| But as a councilmember, you know, I'd like to see a more concise, precise, cut and dry plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1372)|
| 0:23:02| I'd like to see, you know, a property owner to know what they can or cannot do with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| This is a 78-page version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| I think it's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| I mean, I've got my position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| But I just felt like that, you know, we've gone through this long city-county workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| and we have alternative plans that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| And if we ask the MPC who are professional planners to modify the plan to incorporate what's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| that they could come back to us with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Then it's up to us as separate bodies or collectively to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I just want to make two observations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| One, you know, at the last council meeting we postponed, you know, the south sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| And I fully intend to, you know, to vote that up or down, you know, as planned, as I said in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| So I know the chamber was opposed or not opposed but had --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Well, I guess they were opposed because they had a lot in there that was in the original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and wanted that, you know, postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| So I did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| But I do not plan, I will not, you know, we're going to vote that up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I'll assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| I don't think you're going to have that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| I just think somebody on council is going to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| So, I mean, I just throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| I don't think there's that much time left, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| What was wrong with putting them in the format that the chamber did with this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| when you got all four of them side by side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Then you can have, I like A, I like B, I like A here, I like C here, I like D here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| You put them together in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| I'd like to ask a question of Joe Jarrett, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Mr. Jarrett, I'm not going to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| I want to make sure I understand on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Knox County Commission has already voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| The city has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And so the vote from the county was to deny the plan as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| We were told at that time that in order to amend the plan, we had to vote it up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| that we could not make amendments at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| So, I think our position or some of the people on commission's position was let's vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| let's take another look at it, let's see if there are amendments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| So, from the county standpoint, procedurally, we would need to meet, vote on any amendments that we wanted to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| to the MPC, and then the MPC would consider that and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I want to make sure I understand the procedure before I talk further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I mean, that's a procedure you've consistently followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So, from the county standpoint, then, we would need to sit down and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| it may be that we take them item by item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| We look at scope, implementation, project by project review, one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| and determine do we like that or do we want to make changes or modifications and send to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| That may be what we need to do on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And I'm looking for guidance from Mr. Donaldson whether he could give us some suggestions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| or whether that would be pretty much up to us to sit down in a workshop setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| and see if we could try to hammer some of these things out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| So, Mr. Donaldson, what are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| The county commission has the authority to initiate their own amendment to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| and you can come to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| It has to be initiated by resolution by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| So, you can get to that position any number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| But we can make as many amendments as needed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So, if we wanted to amend ten things, we could and send them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| We don't have to amend just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| You are past the plan, your amendment being an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| That could be pick and choose from a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| It could be start with plan A and make a list of changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:19| That process perhaps should have a bit of a public process that opens it up to the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| that have been involved in it for three years in formulating the task force plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| that was ultimately adopted by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| See, I see hours and hours and hours again on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| And in my mind, I don't think we really need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I think we've got documents in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| We know pretty much what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| But I guess I'm looking for how do we get to that point to have that document to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Do we just kind of do it all individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Or can we look to you to help us do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| We certainly can provide that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| We've seen Nick Della Volpe's comments that resulted from the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| And we worked with Mr. Norman to develop the amendments that he presented as a result of the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| We received a copy of plan B at 438 Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| And this week, our comprehensive planners are at a planning conference in Nashville for most of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| So we spent, you know, the early part of the week preparing for a presentation that we gave yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And those planners are still in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| So we haven't had a time, had time to analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| And we didn't see the column comparison that you evidently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| But we can do that analysis and lay it out and make recommendations, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| So you're willing to do that without us taking formal action to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Can we just kind of say, Mark, will you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| And you say, yes, and we can move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I spent a college football career catching punts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I can do it again, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Well, that was one of the questions I was going to ask is whether or not MPC has had a chance to review this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and make recommendations to us, which you've answered on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| So, but that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| And the other thing, too, is that I just want to make clear that I absolutely appreciate all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| and effort, Tony, that the group has put into the Hillside Ridge Top Protection Plan that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| But I also feel that it's extremely important that with not only your amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| but also with what Nick Della Vope had to say and what the chamber has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| I really fully believe that all of us are out to get the best possible plan that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| And I'm not particularly excited about approving a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| and then spending the next year and a half or two years amending a plan if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| MPC can come to us and tell us what's good and what's bad, you know, with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| and the other ideas that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| And I also think that I know myself, I attended a number of those different facilitator plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| and that in the last couple of days in really getting even more involved with both of these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| that there's some questions that I'd like to send to MPC, you know, in terms of being able to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| I think that it's absolutely imperative that we have some type of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I don't want anyone to go away thinking that I'm not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| But I do think that we have an opportunity and we also have a responsibility to come up with the best possible plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| And even though there's been some last-minute shuffling and last-minute ideas that have come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| I think that we ought to take what little bit of time is necessary to review those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| and come up with, again, with the best possible plan if, in fact, MPC will take a look at Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| and give us guidance on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you, Mr. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| I'd like to sometimes when you get in these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| I've been in a couple of processes where they put a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| Have you ever seen a timeline where they put a big old piece of paper across the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| and it's maybe five yards long or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I'd like to put a timeline on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| I would have about 150 marks on it of what we've done all the way through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:38| The facilitated process I thought was getting us to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| I think it helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I'm not against MPC taking some of this new stuff from Plan B and making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| I can see the side-by-side right now that's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| There are a lot of misconceptions, misstatements, exaggerations, et cetera, in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| And so I welcome MPC's take on this effort by the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| But for us to go into more process, I mean, this is painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| I mean, it's time for us to step up and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| I think I just can't see how that we can lengthen this out anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| I'm not going to object too much to MPC making some kind of comment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| But to go further than that, it's just, this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| I've been in some torturous things with county commission, and this is getting close to it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| As we've gone through this process from three years ago, facilitative sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| now we are talking about sending something back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I want the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| I want the best things for our city and our county, our hilltops, ridges, and slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| I see that we can spend the rest of our terms in office, perspectively in commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and council, going back and going back and going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I think if we don't have some really specific instructions for MPC, if we send this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| for them to put the plans side by side, they're going to come back with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| and somebody's not going to like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| And we will be sitting through another series of hearings, another series of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| another series of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| While I appreciate the chamber's concerns now, I also very much appreciate the work of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| and I think the Starbuck pointed out that people gave a lot of time and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| MPC gave a great deal of time and hours to get us to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| So I agree that it's time for us to take a vote, get this on to our next issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| We have a lot of things facing both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and I think we can prolong this forever and never have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Councilman, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I want to agree with Councilwoman Palmer, and I would like to vote sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| But hopefully when this process is over, we will have one plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| and not have two different plans for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| That would not be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| But I hope that we can get to the point where we can vote on this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| That's the only comment I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Well, it's the job of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to evaluate a situation like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| and give their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| They took three years to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| We went through a facilitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| There was an amendment to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| There can be alternative plans coming from Mr. Dellavopi or from the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| but the ultimate job is the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Now, they have taken all the time that humanly, I think, could be taken over three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| went through a facilitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| They gave their opinion, and now we're asking them to reconsider again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| I mean, they've already given their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And this could just go on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| And I don't see why we can't just go ahead and take the MPC's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Let's have an up or down vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| If we vote it in and there's problems with it, that can be amended in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| If we vote it down, then we can consider another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| But to try to take four plans and try to join them together after MPC has already told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| what they think the best plan is, I just don't see an end to it, to be honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| You know, maybe there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| We all want the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| But I think the process to me is we're getting out of the guidelines that were set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| The Metropolitan Planning Commission is what we were supposed to be listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| And I think we should take their opinion and vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| And if we vote it down, then we consider alternative plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| If we continue to ask them to give an opinion, they give it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| then we continually come back with more feedback and ask them to give another opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| I mean, there's no end to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| Mark, can you give us an analysis of Plan B by October the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| I'm talking about the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| My hesitation is that the week of the 10th is a significant week for our regional planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| Early in the week is a kickoff event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and our planning staff is tied up pretty much the whole week with that effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| which essentially leaves us next week to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| The 17th is your work session, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| We can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I would appreciate it if you could because that would be a time for us to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and really take a look at it and start to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| and try to hammer out some of these details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| We've been doing this a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I think it's time for us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| And if you can help us with that and help expedite that, I think at our work session on the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| we could start taking some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Is it still part of our discussion or intent, and I know this was going around somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| that the two bodies were going to meet simultaneously and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Are we still talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Or I was curious as to that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| We had thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| But the sense I get is that the folks over on the city, you're wanting to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| I mean, soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| And, again, I'm just being presumptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| I'm just trying to read the tea leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| When we, the city council, after the county commission voted it down, it was voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| the city council voted and agreed to meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| And we had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| And I'd like for each council member to go back and read the record, if you were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| and see what you said and see what you proposed that we did, that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| And I'd further recommend that you go back and read the original resolution of what the MPC was tasked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| And then if you go and you look at the preface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and you see what the MPC talked about in terms of process and dialogue, we're doing exactly that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| It talks about, in the preface, about further public review, the adoption of new hillside salient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| It was willing to work with the MPC city county staff for a second phase of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| including the drafting review and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Well, you know, it's been rejected over here once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| We decided to go through this joint body, which this member was vehemently opposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| because we're going to have to go and deliberate on this ourselves again one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| And if you want to go ahead and bring it up at the next council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| or you want to bring it up, you know, on the date we postponed it, you can elect to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| That's your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| But I'll tell you, we're doing exactly what most of you wanted to do, and some of us didn't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| but yet you want to complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So what I'm trying to do is ask the MPC to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and to consider all the things that we've heard during this whole facilitation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| and to take the pros and the cons and to do an analysis and come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| And I think we owe it to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| And unless somebody wants to object, then that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| If we want to have a vote up or down, then that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| But we're doing exactly what, you know, we talked about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| And I think some people ought to look at where we originally started on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| in order to understand where we're trying to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| So, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I'm sure that you all operate the same way that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| We had two choices, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| We could not amend one jot or tittle on that day that it came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| The only way we can do anything with this is now make recommendations, send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| and then they bring another document with these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| and fold it into that for a vote the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| So I'm sure you all operate the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| And to answer your question, Commissioner Norman, I don't know if you have some suggestions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| in the near future how we might come back together jointly and after this analysis is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| and vote on it, you know, that's the spirit in which we started this, then I'm open for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| I'm sure the council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Well, they'd have to be separate votes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Yeah, we'll have to go back and follow, you know, each other's charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| But I would prefer to see us meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| That's why we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And if we could vote together, I think that would be the ideal thing is to try to maybe have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| and to have both bodies meet together and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Yes, just for clarity, I agree with everything you just said about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| I mean, whether I was particularly for the process as a group, we have proceeded as the majority of people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| So I just wanted to clarify that you're exactly right, everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Now, I would like to see, of course, that we do have a common vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| And I don't want to go too lengthy, but my main point is at some point I think we have to defer to the MPC's judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| And we can give them all the feedback or at least have that the basis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| And so I'm not opposed for the MPC, of course, taking in all the input that we've had through this process, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| But we can't just let this keep going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| And so if the MPC can, in a short amount of time, try to bring all this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:47| and then hopefully have something consistent and something that looks more like a single piece of legislation instead of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:59| you know, an elephant put together by a committee, you know, kind of how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| I guess what I'm concerned about is all the fragmentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| But if the MPC can come back with something that they feel is consistent, you know, I'd like to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| But I would hope that my colleagues would give a tremendous amount of deference to the next recommendation that the MPC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:23| Because that's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Councilman Delvaux, please add another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| No, actually, it was a new one, but perhaps Mr. Thomas has made the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| I do think it would be helpful to have their view at least on Plan B to see what they think is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| that might be useful in their perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| It will come back to what Commissioner Hammond said, I think, which is at some point when we have that input, we need to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| yes, it's great, or no, add this and this and this, and then vote it and send it back, whatever legal process we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| But at the end of the day, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| These bodies represent the people in the community, and our input is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| And even though we are guided by MPC, we have to make the decision that governs this city and this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| Okay, so, Mr. Donaldson, you're going to have to try to have something back like October 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| That will allow us to meet some deadlines and hopefully move forward on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I just want to make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I want to thank you, Vice Mayor and Chairman Hammond, for the leadership that you're showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| dealing with this somewhat difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| But we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And I just want to thank both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Only that since we've got a date now, October 17th, for the review, what about another end point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| What about a date for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Let's find a time for the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Let's define it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Your meetings on the city are when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Is it the second and fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| I think we need to see how much time it's going to take MPC when they get into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| before we can set a date for that final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| He just said October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Well, but they may run into a snag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| It might be the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| Well, then, let's set a date contingent on no snags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| I was going to throw out the notion that since you all meet in the evening at 7 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| that that might be the best time that perhaps we meet in November at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| Because the 17th, you know, it will take a little while, I guess, to go through some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| But perhaps the commission could meet with the council at your meeting at a 7 o'clock session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| If the council meets on November 1, November 15, and November 29, the way it's currently scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Go ahead, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| What about in order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| And what you're talking about, Tony, which I agree with, that we do need dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| But why don't we don't meet on Tuesday the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| And maybe that would that be enough time to set up a joint meeting between county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| if we did it on one of our off days, whether it's the 8th or if it's two weeks after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| It's election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Then do it two weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Sure, I'm sure we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| What we do is poll council members, see if that's, you know, acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| I don't know how you do it, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| What we ought to do is what we've been doing is we'll come up with some dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| And we'll, Chairman and I will discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| And then we'll poll the commission and the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| And then we'll find the one where we can, most of us can meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| And set it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| As soon as the proposals, the analysis is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Would somebody like to recognize the gentleman at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I'd suggest if you're going to do another revision of this that nobody has really seen plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:37| except maybe you all and a few other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I think you've got another public hearing that's necessary somewhere along the way before you take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| What we need to do is post that now that we have it on the websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| So that's available to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Can we do that at least on the city site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110929hillsideprotectionpart2?start=2884)|
