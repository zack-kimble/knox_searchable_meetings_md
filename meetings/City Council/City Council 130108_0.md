| 0:06:48| Okay, well, we're glad that Montessori School is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| Also, I want to invite everyone to the Plan E.T. symposium tomorrow, January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| It's from 1 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| I'll be there along with Oak Ridge Mayor Tom Behan and a lot of other officials from our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| who have been involved with Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| There's really some good workshops, panel discussions on economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| education, housing, and community health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| So it's a great opportunity to get engaged with the Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| This is our regional sustainability planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| as we continue to work on these very crucial regional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| Again, that is tomorrow, January 9th, from 1 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| And finally, I want to tell you all that next week I'll be going to the U.S. Conference of Mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| in Washington, D.C. They're having their annual legislative conference there in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| They've timed it so after that's over we stay and go to the inauguration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| So I'm very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| I've never been to an inauguration of any president in our country, so I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| But the bad news is that it's during the Martin Luther King event celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| I always enjoy going to those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| So Vice Mayor Pavlis will be representing me at the luncheon on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| And I hope I know many of the council members will be at many of the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| There are a lot of events from Thursday, I think, through Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| celebrating Martin Luther King's birthday and his history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| So the parade start is on Monday at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| And as you all know, the parade route goes from Tabernacle Baptist Church on MLK Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| to the Greater Warner AME Church in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Also, the Thursday before that, the MLK Awards Luncheon is on Thursday, January 17th at noon at the Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=529)|
| 0:08:58| If you want tickets for any of these events or you want more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| you can call 311, call the city, or go to the website at MLKKnoxville.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| and you can get a lot of information about the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| It's always a really wonderful long weekend as we celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| I just wanted to thank Councilman Campin for mentioning the passing of Charlie Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| He was a lifelong South Knoxvillian, very active at the South Knox Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| He was an architect and recently had worked on the Harris Chapel Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| It had burned back in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| And he loved to restore old homes, houses, and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| And he restored eight houses in the old North Knox neighborhood, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| But more important to me and to South Knoxville and Knoxville as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| was his love and his devotion to the Candor Arts and Heritage Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| He was the acting president of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| He was a founding member since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| He, of course, was there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Every time I was there, he was always there promoting Candor and all the activities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| And it's certainly an asset and a crown jewel of South Knoxville and the city as well, right in the heart of Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| He, of course, during Vestal, he was always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| He worked from daylight to dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| I mean, he was just there manning the booths and doing all the work that nobody else really wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| And that was his real passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| And he just will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| He was loved by many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And just a real dedicated soul to not only South Knoxville, but this county and the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| And he'll be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Sure, we all agree with those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I also want to thank Councilman Campton for mentioning Bruce McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| Bruce lived in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| I've known Bruce for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And Bruce's passing as well as Charlie's as far as the architectural community is a great loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| Bruce was 92 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| It's interesting that I have asked Councilor Frost to do a resolution that we'll present at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| But it's interesting that when you go around this city, you realize that the architecture that we have in this city owes a great deal to Bruce McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| In fact, the building we're in is one of his buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| But you can go to the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| You can go to the libraries in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| You can go to the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| He was the master architect for the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| And he also not only did he do fantastic architecture and leave his mark with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| but he was also one of the founding members to bring the School of Architecture to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| But probably his greatest joy and the thing that he was most proud of in the conversations that I had with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| was the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| He was actually the founder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| He had gone to Philadelphia to see how that one was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| and he came back and worked very hard to have what we have today, which is the design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| And those people that would like to remember Bruce, memorials can be made to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| The other thing that I wanted to say is there's very few architects in this town that didn't have some relationship with Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| His firm spawned a lot of architectural firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| They also spawned a lot of architects that are now working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| In fact, one of the reasons that I'm back in Knoxville is that he got in touch with me in Detroit while I was working there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| and asked if I would come back to Knoxville and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| So it's been a long relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| It's one that I'm going to miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| And we can celebrate his life inside this building that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| But we'll have more to say when we have the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| But I just wanted to remember Bruce also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Councilman Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Again, I'll thank Mark Campin for his words during the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| I wanted to mention John Craig, a name that didn't come up, but he was a quiet, gentle man that lived in Holston Hills area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| and was very, very active in his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| He was the kind of person that, you know, didn't have his name out front, but if there was something to be done, he was a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| He worked with the election commission on manning the polls, you know, for decades and decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| He was just the kind of person that made the community's needs his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And we certainly appreciate his service to the community and mourn his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| And I can't let this pass without also recognizing Mary Lou Horner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| Many of us were at the funeral on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| She certainly was a legend in her own time as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| And it was a very special service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Congressman Duncan and Bill Williams from Channel 10 both spoke, as well as some wonderful music and the words of her pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| But I served with Mary Lou on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| She and Bea DeSelm were the first two women ever elected to county court, which later became county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| Then came Wanda Moody, then came me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| So I was the fourth person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| And so I learned a lot from Mary Lou and from Bea and from Wanda, those first three women who kind of set the path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| particularly Mary Lou and Bea, who set the path for women to run for local office like that for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| So she will also be missed in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Okay, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointment of Jackie Lane and Vice Mayor Nick Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| to the Board of Directors of Community Television of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=883)|

| 0:14:49| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| 8B is a resolution confirming the appointments of Karen Eberle and Hubert Smith to the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I believe we have Karen is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you for being willing to serve on the KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Yeah, I would just like to say that I had spoken with Hubert and he sends his regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| He had a prior engagement and he certainly was worried about snubbing the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| But I said we understand and he called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And I think he's been a real advocate and busy in that business for a long time, and I'm sure he'll serve well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Right, and I think he will too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| And so I appreciate both Karen and Hubert being willing to serve on KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| And we've got some exciting news coming soon, our Catamorphosis 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| So you will have a big job to do, Karen, to work with KTA to get all of this implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Articles 2 and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| to allow car-sharing business vehicles to be parked in designated spaces for long periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and to authorize the removal and impoundment of non-car-sharing vehicles parked in such designated spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=972)|

| 0:16:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=974)|

| 0:16:16| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| zoning regulations, Article 2 definitions and Article 5, Section 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| related to designing construction standards for parking areas and driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| including a revised definition for parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Yeah, just a quick question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Mark Donaldson, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| My only concern was when we amended that one of those sections in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I'm flipping quickly to try to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| but we took out the space standard for what a parking space is in terms of the square footage or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1006)|
| 0:16:57| And I understand the reason for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Will you have some substitute standard in there or is it going to be purely discretionary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| In other words, we'll now have a definition that doesn't have, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| any kind of meets and bounds or even a discussion of at least X unless there's Y or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| There are space dimensional requirements stated elsewhere in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| and are, in fact, in conflict with the ones that are in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| The ones in the definition are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| So we're finally getting around to taking that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| We'll go to a table or some other place to find the actual requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| I also want to just recognize what we're doing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Part of this is that we are now going to allow pervious pavement, pervious parking lots in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| And, of course, from an environmental standpoint, this is a big move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| And with the new stormwater regs, we know every drop of water that goes rolling off and into our stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1073)|
| 0:18:03| we have to manage, and it's more and more costly every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And we know that by keeping that water on site and letting it go back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| refilling the water table, all of that stuff is environmentally a progressive thing to do as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| So we are very excited about this move tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| 9C is in ordinance to remove property located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| rezone property located on the southeast side of Millartown Pike, southwest of Amelia Road from R1 to O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| Brennan Garrett, applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Councilman Dalvothy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| It might be for Jim Hagerman, although Mark might be the one to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| There are some photographs in the back about flooding because the back of this property has a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| And I gather from the NPC hearing notes it wasn't the phase to look at the stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| Is that something that will be addressed in the later step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| The stormwater regulations, there's sort of two different answers for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| Current stormwater regulations don't allow any additional runoff from a developed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| So development of this site can't make flooding any worse if it is consistent with regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| As the regulations get tighter, as we get a new permit for the city from the state for the city, those-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| The TDEC general permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Yeah, the TDEC NPDES permit, the regulations tighten further and we will require that the first inch of runoff is infiltrated on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1189)|
| 0:20:06| which is one reason that that previous paving thing was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| It gives us another tool to make that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| But anyway, in the future, currently it can't get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| In the future, it should actually get better when you develop a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| As a practical matter, you address those questions when there's a site plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| We're just talking zoning now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| That's a site plan kind of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| When someone goes for a permit or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1236)|

| 0:21:46| for the period of July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 for a contract price of $165,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1306)|

| 0:21:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I just wanted to say on behalf of the Audit Committee that this is something that doesn't happen every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| We've had the current contractor for almost eight years, Hew & Company, and they've done a fine job for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| But we believed it was important to go out for a bid, and we requested quotes and proposals from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1328)|
| 0:22:17| And we had eight responders, and we narrowed it down to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| We interviewed all of the competing firms and selected unanimously the Crosland firm because of its background and skill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| and its price was also reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| That wasn't the determining factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| But we have recommended it to the full Audit Committee, and they have approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1357)|

| 0:23:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yes, Mr. Boyce Driscoll is here to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| Hello, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Come down and state your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| I'm Boyce Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I live at 3004 Fountain Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| That's in the North Hills neighborhood, I think as most of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| I, and I think most of my neighbors that I've talked to, would like to support the move of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| to acquire this property to solve a long-term problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| We've had in our neighborhood, in the North Hills neighborhood proper, I think this is the only vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| long-term vacant house and a house that we consider to be blighted within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| Several people have approached the owner over the years to attempt to buy this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| and to put it back into service with no positive results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| Well, this house, I want you to also know that this house is number 53 of 130 contributing primary buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1499)|
| 0:25:09| and read that as houses in the North Hills National Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| The district includes the area bounded by North Hills Boulevard, Fountain Park Boulevard and North Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| As a National Register property, the house fits very well within our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| and several of my neighbors who are involved in construction, and myself included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| have looked at the house at least from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| It has a good roof on it, has had a good roof for many years, and is structurally sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| although cosmetically it needs an awful lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| The kitchen was torn out of the house with the obvious intention of restoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| New kitchen cabinets are sitting in the floor and the appliances are sitting in the living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| Heating and air conditioning was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| There's a new unit sitting inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| So the intention originally, obviously, was to fix the house up, and we certainly would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1569)|
| 0:26:20| We want to see the house restored, and we want to see the house become another of our neighborhood houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1580)|
| 0:26:31| and we would like to see good neighbors in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| So we in North Hills, I think I can say we'll do whatever we need to do to see that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| And several of us over the years have complained to the city a number of times concerning this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| and our intention is to try to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| Anyway, that's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you very much, Mr. Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I want to ask Ms. Wade just what the process will be from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| You're estimating paying $35,000, but that's not a hard line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| So just walk us through the process and how that goes and what your intention is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| how you will go about the sales process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I'm Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| If this is approved this evening, then we will request that KCDC pursue acquisition of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| They may try to negotiate a sale with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| That's one way that it could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| You know, we would offer probably appraised value, maybe less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| But out of that money, the past due taxes would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| There's approximately $14,000 in past due taxes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| If that's not successful, they would take the property through eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| in which case the taxes would be taken out of the price that would be paid in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| which would be appraised value, and the balance then would go to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| After that's finished, we would list the property in the Homemakers Program for sale with conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| like all of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Before we move on, I'm sorry, I recognized a minute ago we have Boy Scouts out in the audience as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Could someone come and just tell us who you are, where you're from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| One of the Boy Scout leaders, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| We're a troop 556 from West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| From West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Well, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| I appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1733)|

| 0:29:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I looked and didn't see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Well, it's not really an opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I just want to kind of go back and review this again with Becky and talk about, you know, what we paid for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| and what we're doing, and then you've put, you've done quite a lengthy application process on this purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| and you have plans of what he's going to do, and you have a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| and I just kind of want to walk through that and make sure we understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| and protect ourselves from, you know, that we're, you know, from any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| we're assurances that we have as a city that this money, he's going to put money back into it and resell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| So, kind of walk us through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Yes, this, you all recall this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| You approved that the city acquire it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| It's been listed in the Homemakers Program since early this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and we had one application come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| It didn't pan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| That was in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| We had three or four open houses in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| We've done extensive work to get the house cleaned up, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| in a shape where people could go into it and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| We listed it on Knox Heritage's website as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| and we got an application in November from the Sawneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| and before it went to the Homemakers Committee, we had an independent appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| The appraisal updated, and the appraised value came in at $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| We had paid $110,000 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| So that is what they bid on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| They presented their financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| They are offering cash to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| They have done another property that they purchased through Homemakers over on Plymouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| and they're almost finished with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| Their intention is to completely fix this home, rehabilitate it, and then sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| So we have every confidence that they will do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| and as always, if they don't, there is the reversionary clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| that's recorded with their deed so that the city can take this property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| And they have six months to get started and then a year to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| The year starts from when the deed is executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| So they have a year from when they purchase it to finish the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Good work. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I think it's good to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1911)|

| 0:32:25| to execute all necessary documents to sell such surplus city properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1945)|

| 0:32:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I'm sorry, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| How much are we looking at in terms of the revenue coming in on the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| Jim, our Senior Director of Finance will answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Mr. Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Jim York, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| I don't expect that we're going to get a lot of revenue from these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| These parcels, these are things that we acquired in the tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| and we expect to sell them for less than what the taxes owed are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| So, again, I'm not expecting quite a bit of revenue on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| The advantage is that it puts them back into the tax stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| and leads to potential development of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2005)|

| 0:34:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| I don't know if Janet's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| She is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Just one simple question as you're walking up to the podium, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| I was looking at the map in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| It was a fairly small segment of fiber-optic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Can you tell us what was the primary goal of getting that in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| that one piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I actually don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| That's proprietary information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| From the actual developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| They're obviously going to resell their services to typically these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| long-haul transporters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| resell their services to financial institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| or to other telecommunications providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Someone who's moving a lot of bulk of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| It could be voice or data or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| There may be another one, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| This is, I guess, for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| The lines are already up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| The work has begun at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Are they going to tack on to other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| It could be that some of the lines are aerial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| and some of them are underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| The aerial one is going to be on existing poles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| They would be probably on existing poles, either KUB or Bell South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Looking at the map on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| a lot of that is going to be in the 6th District, according to that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I'm not really that familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Will it have any kind of environmental impact at all on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| Can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| It should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I mean, we've had other companies come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| and they've had minimal impact because of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| I mean, you'll see another line maybe on a pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| or there may be some digging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| but it all has to go through engineering as far as their construction methodologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| and they'll be managed by them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2174)|

| 0:36:47| I just wanted to make a comment that if any of my colleagues had an opportunity to go over to the Holiday Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| and take a look at what Nick Kazan and his folks have done, it's really a vast improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| and I think we need to give him some kudos for what he has done because it's really outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2218)|

| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2297)|

| 0:38:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-12-240 with Sanders Pace Architecture LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| for electrical renovations at the Jacob Building at Chihuly Park to include architectural services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| for the repair of the brick veneer façade, increasing the contract amount by $60,643.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Make an amendment to that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I'd like to make an amendment to this to change the contract amount from $60,643 to $54,142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| $152,000 or $142,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| What I have is $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Which is it, Eddie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| $142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| $142,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay, $54,142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Okay, so this is just correcting what's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Actually, now the total contract then is $60,000, but it's increasing it by $54,142,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| Right, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| So, yeah, it's decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Instead of $60,000, it's going to be $54,000 on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| But it's increasing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| But it's increasing the overall, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| Okay, so first we need the motion to approve this, and then we do the motion to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and then come back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Only original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve as is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| and now we have a motion and a second to amend, this is Councilman Grieve, to $54,142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| So we will vote on the amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Conversation, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Also, there was a question that came up in terms of the responsibility of the work that had been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| and I think if, Mr. Swanson, if you could address that in terms of when the situation was found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| that there was falling panels out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Well, obviously, the situation out there is very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| You don't expect your brick panels to fall off after they've been put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and it's very disappointing to us that that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And it's not the performance for those panels that we would have expected to receive from those panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| From a legal point of view, however, there is something called a statute of repose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| which is a period of time within which you've got to sue if you're going to sue with regard to architects and contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| It starts to run from the date of substantial completion of whatever the project may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| There are some rare and limited exceptions to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| We do not have any evidence that we fit into one of those rare and unusual exceptions in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| And so we do not we the statute of repose has run and well run over four years since the statute of repose ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| which means your right to sue is cut off in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| So we do not believe we have legal redress against the original contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| or the manufacturers of the improvements that are up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| But we still need to address it, and we need to put brick veneers back up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| It was my understanding the project was finished in 2004, and the repose would be finished in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| We discovered it in 2011, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| My understanding it was found in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| But it is a situation that we need to act on this and get this underway immediately because of the situation we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I went out there, and the situation is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And that's certainly a building that's important to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Unfortunately, I have a professional conflict, so I can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I haven't had time to discuss with my attorney whether I should vote on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| So I'm going to abstain on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Councilman Del Vopi, you turned off your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I just want to say that was my question to Charles and express my complete dissatisfaction with that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| and how long it lasted or how long it didn't last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| So if you feel like you've exhausted those efforts, then I stand disappointed, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| We're all disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| We are now voting on the motion to amend to the 54,142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| And we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Yes, we have one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| And now we're back to the original motion, which is to approve now as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| I have one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| 11-0 is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Zipcar Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| to allow Zipcar Inc. to park its vehicles on four to eight spaces designated as car share vehicle spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| If Susanna is here, I don't know if she's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Is Susanna here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Jake is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Jake, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Jake is here to fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Just a matter of curiosity, Jake, there's a provision in there that says that we're not charging any licensing fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| or I guess any, like, rental of the parking space to Zipcar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| And I realize this is kind of a demonstration program, but at some point we start giving away revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Is that only for the duration of the trial effort, or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Jake Teisinger, project manager for the Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Yes, the goal of this is to ensure viability of a car share program within Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| So for the duration of the agreement, which I believe is after a year, both parties could agree to extend it from that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2673)|
| 0:44:43| there will be no exchange of money between Zipcar or the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| But in the future we might actually rent those spaces to them or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| It's not explicitly stated in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| I don't believe that's the intention at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| As far as I understand it, those will be the Zipcar spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And if at some point we decided we wanted to do that, we could have a new agreement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| or start to talk with them about that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| I would ask that you look at that for the future, not for this particular agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| But it seems to me that downtown parking spaces are precious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| and we ought to get some revenue to cover our costs of just making them available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| That was my concern, you know, especially when you look at the parking spaces on Clinch Avenue and Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| You know, it's right next to the Holson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I'm sure there's a lot of residents, a lot of people that live in the Holson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| that enjoy parking in those parking spaces on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| And being a downtown resident, if that was on my street, I wouldn't really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| But I'm in favor of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| But I think that's something we need to consider in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Of course, let's remember, you know, the irony of this is the Zipcars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| the idea is to make it so fewer people have to have cars, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| can take public transit and can have other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| So it actually ends up ultimately freeing up spaces as more people use alternative transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| knowing that they have a Zipcar available to them should they actually need to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| So, again, this is another example of our sustainability efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| that I think we're trying some new things here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| Certainly this is being done in other places very effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So I appreciate Jake and our Office of Sustainability for bringing this opportunity to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Yeah, I would just dovetail on that and say, was there, can you approach, maybe approach UT in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| and maybe they could supply some parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| We've given them some streets here recently, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| and I would hope that they would maybe donate or make available some spots on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| instead of taking our city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| So let's make that as a dovetail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Are these spaces reserved just for Zipcars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| So that I can't park there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| You'll be towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| You just passed an ordinance previously that you would get towed if you parked there illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| So we have an enforcement situation that we have to watch for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| We will be enforcing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| They're watching you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Don't test us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Reserved for car sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| It's not just Zipcars because we don't have an exclusive agreement with Zipcar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| That's not an exclusive agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| So it could be some other car sharing plan in addition to Zipcar, but it can't be your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Or my car or your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Unless you share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| The Sheriff of Vestal will get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130108?start=2859)|
