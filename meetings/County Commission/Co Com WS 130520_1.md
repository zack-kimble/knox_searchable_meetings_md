| 2:45:15| One of them is 13 years of expenses for Knox County in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9915)|
| 2:45:24| And the second slide is the ACT scores achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| And the expenses are based on the state's statistical report that includes more than what the education system publishes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9929)|
| 2:45:41| It includes, for example, capital and interest-related expenses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9941)|
| 2:45:50| And what is plainly clear is that the expenses have been going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| and the education achievement as measured by the ACT have not gone anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9955)|
| 2:46:03| And I would like to make sure that it is clear to all of you that Knox County is not alone in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| The state is not doing as well as Knox County is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| And the results are going to be a bit surprising to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9977)|
| 2:46:24| when I really go to what the ACT scores really mean in terms of readiness to be employed or employability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9984)|
| 2:46:34| which is the key issue for kids that we put through public schooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9994)|
| 2:46:40| I looked at the career and college readiness figure that's published by ACT for the USA, for Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10000)|
| 2:46:51| and also for Knox County, and demographically as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10011)|
| 2:46:58| And what stands out is that in the USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| only 25 percent of those with a high school diploma are career and college ready according to ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10024)|
| 2:47:14| What that means is according to ACT's 2006 definition of college readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10034)|
| 2:47:22| that meant that that is synonymous with work readiness as well from 2006 onward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| But back then it was based on only the reading and the math scores from ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10050)|
| 2:47:38| According to ACT's 2012 figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10058)|
| 2:47:43| college and career readiness depends on the readiness that they publish by subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10063)|
| 2:47:51| and they test in four subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| And that merely means on a per subject basis that you are ready to enter the first year of college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10074)|
| 2:48:05| and have a 70 percent chance of finishing that one subject with a C grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10085)|
| 2:48:12| which is nothing really to get excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| In other words, it does not talk about readiness to finish college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| It talks about a percentage probability of finishing math and reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10100)|
| 2:48:30| and English and science course in the freshman year only with a 70 percent probability or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10110)|
| 2:48:40| So the career and college readiness is really like a baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| under which those who do not qualify are going to get into a career, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10126)|
| 2:48:52| for the coming 50 years or so that is going to be compensated closer to minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10132)|
| 2:48:59| And those positions have been and will be replaced by robotics and technology in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10139)|
| 2:49:08| To me it is shocking, you know, at age 73 that these are the kind of things we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10148)|
| 2:49:19| I mean when I'm looking at black students who have a high school diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10159)|
| 2:49:24| they have only a 3 percent career and college ready kids with regular high school diplomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10164)|
| 2:49:33| that they have earned both in Knox County and in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10173)|
| 2:49:41| That is absolutely terrifying in my mind because the readiness being across all students being 21 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10181)|
| 2:49:53| or 79 percent are not ready, okay, that's like a loaded powder keg for society in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10193)|
| 2:50:03| And then you superimpose on top of that 97 percent of black students not being ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10203)|
| 2:50:10| I mean just think about what that's going to create here, okay, and what that will create nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10210)|
| 2:50:18| And there is no logical way I can account for those results being so poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10218)|
| 2:50:25| So the big question is what will be the result on our crime and our economy because we are not producing enough kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10225)|
| 2:50:35| who are ready to support the various industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10235)|
| 2:50:42| I would have three suggestions, three recommendations for a change to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| In no organization do you have anything achieved unless you have measurable goals, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10249)|
| 2:51:00| And the measurable goals have to be in the area that is a key indicator of achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10260)|
| 2:51:07| The key indicator of achievement in education is the ACT score itself, the average ACT score itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| that you get at the end of the pipeline at the end of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10274)|
| 2:51:22| Goals like what we have, which is not uncommon by the way in the state, there are many similar goals to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10282)|
| 2:51:30| Goals like 190, 90, 90, they are too complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10290)|
| 2:51:36| A goal has to be understood by every employee, certainly every supervisor in an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10296)|
| 2:51:43| And preferably every employee for that goal to really happen and take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10303)|
| 2:51:51| So to have goals that are really complicated like 190, 90 where you have one term saying that 100% is going to finish high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10311)|
| 2:52:03| finishing high school doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10323)|
| 2:52:09| If 21% of them are going to be ready to learn a job and 79% will not be ready, then a diploma is worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10329)|
| 2:52:20| 90% will take the ACT test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10340)|
| 2:52:27| Taking a test is meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| A score higher than 21 is not meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| First of all, it's based on a very small remainder number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| Second of all, a 21 ACT is in a range where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10365)|
| 2:52:51| 89%, 79% are not ready for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10371)|
| 2:52:57| So I think it would be important to have a goal that's meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10377)|
| 2:53:03| That is an average ACT score in order to see any improvement whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10383)|
| 2:53:09| Because people need to be able to focus on that goal only for it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| Second suggestion, we cannot get good performance with a low morale workforce in any industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10396)|
| 2:53:23| I communicate with close to 500 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| This is a very rough figure because it's not a proper survey, but the morale appears to be very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10409)|
| 2:53:36| And I think that some of you had some contacts and maybe have a similar impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10416)|
| 2:53:44| I think it is always in order in any organization that is more than, say, a couple of hundred employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10424)|
| 2:53:53| To have a reputable third party conduct a job satisfaction survey and also a turnover analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10433)|
| 2:54:00| Because turnover, the cost of turnover, is typically 6 months to 12 months of employment with overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10440)|
| 2:54:10| So it's a very expensive thing for turnover to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10450)|
| 2:54:16| And you generally do a satisfaction survey and turnover analysis on each one of the past three fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10456)|
| 2:54:26| And that will give a specific indication as to what the situation is and then one can address that and correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| I would say that if you have a morale problem in your workforce that produces the results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| and you put on them a performance measurement system that they have no control over, or it has elements that you don't have control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10481)|
| 2:54:53| you will just push that dissatisfaction level even lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10493)|
| 2:54:59| So it is very important to correct the morale first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10499)|
| 2:55:06| But measure performance based on what employees have control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10506)|
| 2:55:14| And lastly, this is a large organization we are talking about in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10514)|
| 2:55:21| 8,000 employees, 400 plus million dollars budget is a huge management job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10521)|
| 2:55:28| And in each school the tasks are somewhat unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10528)|
| 2:55:34| You're dealing with a little bit different mix of capabilities and demographics and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10534)|
| 2:55:41| So in any business or even in the military, the command has to be decentralized to the level of the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| And I see this as a decentralization to the level of high schools where the feeder schools themselves would report to that high school principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10548)|
| 2:56:06| And let them have the responsibility for all of those things that have anything to do with performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| Budget, curriculum, spending, personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10573)|
| 2:56:21| Discipline decisions especially, which is the major issue for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| It appears based on what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| Then I think it would be in order to give principals the objective to achieve a certain ACT grade and a mutually agreeable grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10593)|
| 2:56:43| And to have each school to have measurable, clear objectives that lead up to the ACT, the average ACT achievement that the district would commit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10603)|
| 2:56:59| In order to get approval for a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| And before we get to a situation where you have to actually deliver real results for the money, I don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10625)|
| 2:57:12| I don't think we are going to see any improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10632)|
| 2:57:18| This is so in any business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| This is so in any kind of organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10644)|
| 2:57:30| And it has been that way now for 13 years based on the figures that I have charted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| And I appreciate you spending the time with me here to listen to these few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10656)|
| 2:57:44| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10664)|
| 2:57:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10678)|
| 2:58:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10702)|
| 2:58:34| So, I'd like to throw that over the wall, so to speak, to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10714)|
| 2:58:46| And I'll bring those up and ask questions and ask Dr. McIntyre and staff to respond to those next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10726)|
| 2:58:53| How would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10733)|
| 2:59:00| I would like to add that we should not discount the fact that Dr. McIntyre's job is significantly more difficult than what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10740)|
| 2:59:13| I noticed that in the history of the education system, performance has been very poor and superintendents have come and gone like a revolving door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10753)|
| 2:59:19| And nobody solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10759)|
| 2:59:26| To manage an 8,000 person, $400 million organization is a huge management job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10766)|
| 2:59:33| And an elected board is just not trained and experienced to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10773)|
| 2:59:40| This is not a negative comment, but they are just not from an environment where they have been trained and experienced in diagnosing problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10780)|
| 2:59:52| coming from a large organization like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10792)|
| 2:59:58| So he has a very tough job, I think, coming and reporting to an elected board and having a large central organization on his other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| In my opinion, it's like being between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10803)|
| 3:00:14| And if we had the opinion of changing superintendents again, I would say your odds are not very good that you are going to do any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| because of what past experience have shown. And help him. Help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10820)|
| 3:00:35| Okay. Well, one other thing. Certainly the issue of ACT as being a core central indicator, that is gaining much more popularity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10835)|
| 3:00:50| widespread credibility of actually what schools are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| Just last week, the director of the Chamber of Commerce said virtually the same thing in a business meeting in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10856)|
| 3:01:05| He emphasized how critical ACTs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| He said, fundamentally, you can kind of just forget this graduation rate stuff and TCAPs, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10871)|
| 3:01:19| Real measurement is ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| So what you're saying is being heard and it's actually being repeated by some very significant people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10885)|
| 3:01:31| Ms. Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10891)|
| 3:01:37| Yes. So you want Dr. McIntyre to answer all of these at our meeting Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10897)|
| 3:01:43| Dr. McIntyre, he's here listening to this, and I think it would be interesting in our process of discussing school strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10903)|
| 3:01:53| I think I'll ask it. Yeah. I think I'll ask him in that discussion section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10913)|
| 3:01:59| Next Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| Next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| You want to go through all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| The curriculum, that's decided at the state level, that he has no control over that, and neither does his board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10931)|
| 3:02:19| So, you know, as long as we can focus on things that we do have control over, I mean, I think you bring up some very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10939)|
| 3:02:27| I don't agree, naturally, with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10947)|
| 3:02:33| And, you know, we talk about ACT scores, and that's the important thing, not TCAPs, but, you know, ACT is a standardized test, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| If you're going to say one standardized test counts and one set of standardized tests don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10959)|
| 3:02:47| as a parent of a rising seventh grader, it's all important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| All of it is. TCAPs, ACT, having her prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10973)|
| 3:02:59| But, you know, if we tend to focus on just one aspect of achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10979)|
| 3:03:05| then I think we run the risk of our focus being entirely too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10985)|
| 3:03:12| There's more to raising a well-rounded, prepared individual than just that ACT score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| Now, it's probably, no doubt, it's incredibly important, but it's not the only thing that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=10999)|
| 3:03:25| And it is a standardized test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11005)|
| 3:03:29| Anyway, it's, you know, I would love to sit down and talk about this a lot more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11009)|
| 3:03:35| not just with Dr. McIntyre, but also with board members, and, frankly, that was one of the things that I'd hoped that we would be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| at a retreat, which never happened, which was supposed to happen, which I'm not real happy about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11021)|
| 3:03:48| But, Tony, I've already talked to you about that, and I'm going to keep talking to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11028)|
| 3:03:54| So that should have happened, and it didn't, and that's on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11038)|
| 3:03:59| So, but these are the kinds of things that should be discussed in that setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11039)|
| 3:04:04| I think not during a budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| May I comment on that, Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| You know I'm always happy to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11053)|
| 3:04:17| You're right, and the ACT is curriculum-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11057)|
| 3:04:25| It is a standardized test, and there is really no way to get away from a standardized test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11065)|
| 3:04:33| if you want to find out what kids learned based on a given curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| With the TCAPs and state tests in general, the problem has been, with the exception of Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11079)|
| 3:04:48| that their rigor has been a lot lower than the national tests, which are the ACT and the SAT and the NAEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11088)|
| 3:05:03| Okay, they are virtually identical in rigor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| And I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| I think that the TCAPs, based on the American Diploma Project, have been agreed upon to increase in rigor year by year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11112)|
| 3:05:25| and they certainly have gone higher since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| But even in 2012, they are 58% lower than the ACT, NAEP, and SAT rigor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11129)|
| 3:05:40| So in terms of what counts, what makes the ACT interesting, and I think important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11140)|
| 3:05:47| is that ACT also computes and also runs an empirical program to investigate what positions kids are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11147)|
| 3:05:57| based on the ACT scores that they have achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| So this is where the readiness career and college readiness comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| So for me, because of those qualities, the ACT has been made more popular than the SAT or the NAEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11167)|
| 3:06:17| which is given only once every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| So many other things count, but generally a single goal is very important when you want to achieve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11180)|
| 3:06:29| There are subordinate goals, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| but I'm talking about what the most important goal is that people need to focus on to achieve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11193)|
| 3:06:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11200)|
| 3:06:41| Dr. McIntyre, go ahead and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| I guess I just assume to talk about it this evening if we're here and the questions have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| I appreciate Mr. Spencer is always talking about what's most important to us, which is student achievement and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11209)|
| 3:06:56| I think when you look at the ACT outcomes historically, you do have to take into account the context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11216)|
| 3:07:03| which is that three years ago we as a state did not test all of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11223)|
| 3:07:10| and we as a school system did not test all of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| We tested about 2,500 of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| Two years ago we began to, at the behest of the state and because it was the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| test virtually all of our high school students at some point in their career with the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11243)|
| 3:07:29| So we have increased the number of test takers by about a third in that two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11249)|
| 3:07:35| so an additional 1,000 roughly test takers in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| And so I think that's an important piece of context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| and once that we reached equilibrium around the number of test takers going from the prior year to this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11263)|
| 3:07:51| going from the class of 2011 to the class of 2012, we saw an increase in our composite ACT score of 20.4 to 20.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11271)|
| 3:07:59| But we also recognize that when you look at averages, that can mask some important dynamics within the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11279)|
| 3:08:07| You can increase your average by increasing the number of students who get 34s and 35s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11287)|
| 3:08:14| but also not doing well at the bottom end of that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| And I think, you know, from the perspective of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| and from the perspective of what we've heard from our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| it's important for us to really look at the proportion of our kids that score a 21 or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11305)|
| 3:08:30| And 21's not a magic number, it's just a number that we know demonstrates a certain level of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11310)|
| 3:08:36| and competency and skill for our kids and opens some doors for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| And we have set this goal of 190, 90, 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| And what that entails is it basically brings together the notion of high school graduation rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11323)|
| 3:08:49| and the notion of the proportion of our kids scoring a 21 or better into a single indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| And on that indicator, we've gone from, so it's really the proportion of our students who enter ninth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11334)|
| 3:09:01| who four years later graduate successfully and score a 21 or better on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11341)|
| 3:09:06| And that statistic has gone from about 34 percent three years ago to over 40 percent this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11346)|
| 3:09:13| and continues to move in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| So I think that is an important metric, and I think it's one that we need to really keep an eye on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11356)|
| 3:09:23| and make sure that, you know, that that's something that we continue to set a very rigorous goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| and continue to make progress against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| So I think it's important that we look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| The other issue I think that we have, that Mr. Spencer raised, and I think we've, you know, just to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11372)|
| 3:09:41| is the issue of decentralization and decision making and where that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| We really rely very heavily on our school principals to make good decisions for their school community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11385)|
| 3:09:53| and for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| So we provide, I think, a good deal of autonomy and flexibility and responsibility at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11395)|
| 3:10:03| But we also insist on a level of accountability that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| And so in terms of making decisions around budget and personnel and a lot of those other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11408)|
| 3:10:13| with the potential exception of curriculum, which the standards are really set by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11413)|
| 3:10:20| I feel like we have provided that level of autonomy to our students over time, excuse me, to our schools over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11420)|
| 3:10:28| and certainly agree that that's beneficial to have some of that decision making at the level that's closest to our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11428)|
| 3:10:37| our schools, and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| And I think one last thing I would say about the proportion of ACT takers, what you see is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11441)|
| 3:10:46| and Mr. Spencer mentioned the college and career readiness benchmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| and about 21 percent of our students met all four of those benchmarks for the class of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11450)|
| 3:10:58| But I would say this again, because we increased the number of test takers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| the gross number of students who have achieved that college and career readiness benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11462)|
| 3:11:10| in all four subject areas on the ACT actually has increased over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11470)|
| 3:11:15| So the proportion might be going down because we're testing more kids, or it actually hasn't gone down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11475)|
| 3:11:21| it's gone up a little bit, but it might not look like major progress because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| but when you look at the gross number of kids who have met all four of those college and career readiness benchmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11485)|
| 3:11:31| it actually has gone up over the last several years somewhat considerably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| both for the Knox County schools and for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| May I respond to Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| How about one last response, and then we can chew on this a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| and present some part of this at least when we take it back up on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11510)|
| 3:11:58| Go ahead, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| Dr. McIntyre, when you take a measurement system that consists of four different elements mathematically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11520)|
| 3:12:11| and some of those elements are not meaningful, like finishing high school in four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11531)|
| 3:12:23| has certainly not much meaning with respect to being ready to be employed or go on to higher learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11543)|
| 3:12:32| or even earning a regular diploma when 21% are ready, according to ACT, to be trained for a job or go on to higher learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11552)|
| 3:12:49| or kids who took a particular test like the ACT, it's really meaningless without the scores that they have achieved on the ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11569)|
| 3:13:00| and when you multiply all these together to arrive at something, a figure in what's called a cascading computation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11580)|
| 3:13:10| it is far inferior to an average that comes out from the measuring authority who are ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11590)|
| 3:13:19| So I think we can agree to disagree on a mathematical basis that when you deal with uncertain terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11599)|
| 3:13:29| or less certain terms and less important terms, the average from the provider of the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11609)|
| 3:13:36| is really the meaningful element that tells the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11616)|
| 3:13:41| And of course I think the objective would be in raising that average ACT is to raise not only the low end kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11621)|
| 3:13:49| but all kids, and we had a tendency with No Child Left Behind and with some other programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11629)|
| 3:13:58| to pour a lot more money into the low end to raise them at an expense to the high end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11638)|
| 3:14:04| and a good example is the amount of funding that the higher performing high schools get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11644)|
| 3:14:12| compared to those that are performing at a very low ACT level year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11652)|
| 3:14:19| And one wonders, you know, what the spending actually achieves other than following what the government mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11659)|
| 3:14:28| if you understand what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| So I appreciate what you're saying, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11671)|
| 3:14:36| I just disagree mathematically about the philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11676)|
| 3:14:39| Okay, we've got a couple of lights on, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| Okay, I'm a mathematical difference of opinion, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| I just wanted to say that, you know, I understand everything that you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| but to me the education process goes back to the very basic teacher and student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11690)|
| 3:14:59| what goes on in that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| And one of the things that really struck me when I went with Dr. McIntyre last year to about 20 to 25 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11702)|
| 3:15:09| was I'm convinced that our teachers are heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11709)|
| 3:15:13| I think they are unsung heroes in Knox County because we're asking them to do a gargantuan job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11713)|
| 3:15:19| We're asking them to overcome societal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| When you have a child who comes to school and they haven't eaten and they're hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| that's a problem because it's difficult to teach that child when they're hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| So we're doing everything we can to try to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| The second thing is many are coming from single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11735)|
| 3:15:39| In Christenbury, for example, they have a 47 percent turnover in students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11739)|
| 3:15:44| because people are moving in and out constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| Now, think of the impact that has on the child when the child is moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11746)|
| 3:15:51| and constantly going in and out of different schools and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11751)|
| 3:15:54| And so you look at what is going on in the home life of a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| and they spend an inordinate amount of time trying to deal with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| who are coming from environments and issues that we're asking our teachers to try to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11762)|
| 3:16:08| and to try to help them in the learning process when there's nothing they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| when that child leaves at 3.30 or 4 o'clock every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| I'm just saying my point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| Yes, we want to increase ACT scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| We want to increase all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| But we're asking our teachers to develop and to try to cope with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11782)|
| 3:16:30| who are coming to school with issues that they have no control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| and they're doing everything they can to try to help them through this learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| Carter High School, for example, when I was out there as a teacher for a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| 57 percent of their students were going to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| That means 43 percent won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but she's doing everything she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| to try to encourage these students to go on to college and to get some secondary education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| Pellissippi moving into Straw Plains is going to be a huge, I think, boost to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11811)|
| 3:16:57| But, again, these are just issues that the teachers are facing on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11817)|
| 3:17:03| that we don't hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| We hear about the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| We hear about all of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| But Mr. Norman knows that better than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| When you come into a classroom environment and you've got students who are having issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| that they have no control over, but yet it does affect the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| It does affect the classroom environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| And my family are teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11840)|
| 3:17:21| My daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11841)|
| 3:17:22| My wife is a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11842)|
| 3:17:23| So I fully understand all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| So my point is, and I didn't mean to ramble, but I just think our teachers do a great job for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| And I think that we're asking them to do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| We're asking them to meet a lot of benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| We're asking them to meet standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| But yet they're also having to deal with what goes on in that room with these kids on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| And there are some of those things that they just have absolutely no control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| but I think they do a good job of trying to manage those things and trying to handle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11869)|
| 3:17:50| I agree with Mr. Hammond's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| I heard the same thing and I observed the same things in classrooms here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| But I would like to point out that based on what I heard, the teacher's biggest complaint is the discipline issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11879)|
| 3:18:07| which relates to state laws, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| And I think that schools could petition legislature, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11891)|
| 3:18:17| to make some changes in state laws to deal with discipline issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11897)|
| 3:18:21| In some states they are dealing with it by allowing the principal to issue a traffic ticket-like instrument to the parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11901)|
| 3:18:32| to pay for the bad behavior of the child rather than having no consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11912)|
| 3:18:40| So there may be some solutions here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| You know, I'm not advocating that this is a simple matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| and doing one particular thing is going to remove the impediment to reaching a better ACT score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11928)|
| 3:18:58| But teacher morale can be acted upon if we know what is to be acted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11938)|
| 3:19:03| This is very common in all companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| Discipline problems can be acted upon and they can be helped if we are making the right steps that other states have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11947)|
| 3:19:16| or if we petition legislature to make the laws a bit easier for the schools about the litigious behavior of parents, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11956)|
| 3:19:29| And this is a very gray area that needs to be balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11969)|
| 3:19:35| But leaving that alone doesn't do the job and it does not remove a major impediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11975)|
| 3:19:41| that is standing in the way of educating more kids to a higher level, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11981)|
| 3:19:47| Okay, Ms. Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| As far as the discipline thing goes, the whole idea about issuing tickets with monetary damages for the parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11989)|
| 3:19:56| that falls right in line with Senator Campfield's let's take money away from the families if the students don't do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=11996)|
| 3:20:03| What they're doing is taking more money away from a family that most of our kids who have bad behavior come from poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12003)|
| 3:20:10| I mean they're acting out for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| And so taking scarce resources away and making their resources even scarcer is not going to improve their behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| and it's certainly not going to improve the parents' parenting skills either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12019)|
| 3:20:23| They're going to get mad at these kids because you cost me another five bucks today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| so I'm going to bust you up against the wall and see how you like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| Those kinds of punitive actions don't help create a positive discipline environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12029)|
| 3:20:40| And as far as the $100, $90, $90, $90, I appreciate that because it includes every student in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12040)|
| 3:20:53| If I'm a parent of a special needs child or a special education child, they're not going to take the ACT, much less score anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12053)|
| 3:21:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12061)|
| 3:21:02| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12063)|
| 3:21:04| They may not be able to complete the credits to get a diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12066)|
| 3:21:07| But they can have that goal to complete their high school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| And that's where that 100 percent comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12071)|
| 3:21:14| That includes every child in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| And I can't tell you how important I think that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| I don't want any parent to look at the Knox County schools' goals and not see their child represented in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12080)|
| 3:21:27| Same thing with, you know, kids who graduate with a diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| Not all of them are going to be able to take the ACT and do well or even should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| You know, we know there's a lot of kids who should not go on to a four-year college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| They'd be much better served doing a, you know, career or technical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12099)|
| 3:21:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12104)|
| 3:21:45| But I want their parents to see them reflected in that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12105)|
| 3:21:48| I think that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| But I understand what you're saying about, you know, focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12111)|
| 3:21:55| But it has to include everybody or to me it just isn't worthy of what we're trying to do to educate the whole child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12115)|
| 3:22:04| and our entire group of children in Knox County regardless of what their abilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12124)|
| 3:22:11| Would you accept the idea that what we need to do is increase the percentage of students who are better educated than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12131)|
| 3:22:20| let's say, they were in the past, which means that 100% may not be covered in a certain definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12140)|
| 3:22:31| But a higher percentage is going to be able to get a job and be employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12151)|
| 3:22:39| And I'm not addressing college or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| I'm simply addressing the ability to learn, which is becoming more and more a lifetime task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12162)|
| 3:22:50| And a lot of our special ed kids go on to jobs in Goodwill or Sunshine Industries and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12170)|
| 3:22:56| working through the Sotomayor Center and places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| So I think that they're, do I want to see more kids take the ACT and score high and go on to college and get good jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12179)|
| 3:23:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| But I think we can't lose sight of all the kids, you know, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12188)|
| 3:23:13| And, of course, you know, I want my kids to score, you know, as high as possible because I know from my own experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12193)|
| 3:23:19| when I went on to college, I had a 32 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12199)|
| 3:23:22| So I had colleges that offer scholarships based on, and I knew as high as I could get, the more money I was going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12202)|
| 3:23:30| which meant the more flexibility I had to get out of Chattanooga and somewhere else to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12210)|
| 3:23:36| So I expect my kids to score high, but I know that that's not going to be possible, you know, for every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12216)|
| 3:23:42| And we need to look at each child's abilities individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| And that's, I think, part of what makes it so hard when we're looking at the whole system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12225)|
| 3:23:50| is that we have to treat each child as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12230)|
| 3:23:54| And that makes it hard to put them all through the same chute and expect them all to achieve and do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12234)|
| 3:24:03| Does that mean that we should abandon the idea of producing higher average results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12243)|
| 3:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| Okay, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| Seeing no further lights, I appreciate Mr. Spencer being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12256)|
| 3:24:21| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| Ms. Fugate for being here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| I get hammered a little bit from Amy with regularity on this retreat issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| I'm giving him every chance I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| Good for you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| You made some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12274)|
| 3:24:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| And so, but certainly one of the things that I hope to accomplish through our committee is those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12277)|
| 3:24:46| that committee, that educational and commission committee on education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12286)|
| 3:24:52| that these issues could be addressed there and ferreted out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12292)|
| 3:24:57| And then, you know, if we need it, if we need that kind of meeting, we can have that kind of meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| I just haven't seen it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| But anyway, it's a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| Thank you, Ms. Fugate, for sticking in here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| And the same, Dr. McIntyre, some of these issues resonate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| You hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| You know what teachers feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| Mike's brought up how important teachers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| And it is, I think, and truly is the progress that kids make are, to a large part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12322)|
| 3:25:30| due to what teachers do and how they are in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| And we're certainly trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| We're trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| And I know you all are trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| So we'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=12339)|
