| 0:01:00| So, Ms. Coatney, we will let you read the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Item 3, consideration of a motion to authorize the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| on behalf of the Knox County Board of Education in the mask mandate case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| to enter into an agreement with the plaintiffs to propose to the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| that the mask mandate be lifted upon conditions agreed to by both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| while the parties mediate or for so long as the court might permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| So do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Spad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| I intend to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| I wrote down a few notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| I intend to vote for this because I have dedicated my life to what's best for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| but personally I believe the only reason the plaintiffs have agreed to this joint proposal at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| is to save face since the entire country of the United States is unmasked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| and I just hope that they do not see this as a victory after the harm they have done to our students for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| So I will be voting for it on behalf of the students of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| but I felt like that needed to be added into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220307-special?start=141)|
