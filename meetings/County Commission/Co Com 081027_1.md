| 2:44:06| Well, it sounds like we need to go back to the negotiation table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| And although we have a motion and a substitute motion, I would rather this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| and since I can't make it a substitute-substitute motion, I would prefer that this go back to the negotiating table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9857)|
| 2:44:25| if the makers of the motions would defer this until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9865)|
| 2:44:31| so that they can get this type of language drawn up and negotiate it out so they can bring it back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9871)|
| 2:44:39| so that we can take care of the concerns that Commissioner Pinkston has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| So, you know, I'm just trying to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| You know, I have those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| I also have concerns on the price and the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| and whether or not Knox County is getting a good deal on the property that's valued way more than what we're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9898)|
| 2:45:07| So, and I've talked with people out in the community, and they have concerns, too, as taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| And, you know, I think we need to go back to the table and negotiate maybe some type of price, terms of a loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9913)|
| 2:45:23| and some type of deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| And, you know, and without that, I just can't support this the way it's written today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9927)|
| 2:45:32| May I address to the deed restriction around the language about Medicare-Medicaid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| If that language were inclusive of Medicare and Medicaid, 62 percent would not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9938)|
| 2:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| So if we're talking about a combined Medicare-Medicaid population and commitment to a combined population of 62 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9946)|
| 2:45:54| we would agree to that language being placed into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| Well, I would prefer that our attorney here, Mr. Lockett, and you, I guess, Arthur Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9958)|
| 2:46:08| our attorney, to sit down and try to hammer out the exact language so that we're not trying to write this on a whim here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| and so that we know exactly what we're voting on as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| So that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| I mean, Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| You've been through the firing line today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| There's a lot going on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9994)|
| 2:46:38| Mr. Hammond, you were talking about wanting this money to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| I don't know if this was in your part of your motion or not, but I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10001)|
| 2:46:45| and if we do postpone 30 days, whatever, Mr. Law Director, I'd like to see that this money goes to pay on the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| whatever Knox County owes them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10011)|
| 2:46:52| I don't know if that's what you meant, Mr. Hammond, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| You said put it back in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| I don't know if that's what you're talking about or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| And also, is there a possible way instead of 35 years we can knock this down to 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| If we do postpone it, I want to look at trying to get this a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| And one last thing I wanted to ask you, Ms. Porter, is I get a lot of phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| and this is for the people at home that are watching or not, for the people on Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10038)|
| 2:47:22| how many acres, the total acreage and how many you're not taking, we're not selling the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| we're not selling the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10047)|
| 2:47:28| How many acres is Knox County retaining on that particular site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10048)|
| 2:47:34| Let me answer the question in reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| The amount of acreage that's in the deal is between 24 and 25, I think about 24.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10056)|
| 2:47:42| It is not inclusive of Beverly Park or the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| It is Beverly Park Circle north up to the top of the ridge line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10067)|
| 2:47:53| So how many acres are in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| There's about 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| So the golf course and all of its issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| I think Doug Battelle said the other day there was about 90 left, but I don't want to speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10079)|
| 2:48:04| I may be in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| And then also we talked about this in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| Commissioner Brown was talking about the, what's it, Hillwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| Are you going to cut some of that out and realign the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| We're still looking at doing that and get some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| Yes, Dave Hill and we have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| The city office has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| And we have believed we can mutually agree upon a resolution to that south property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10106)|
| 2:48:33| You know, and it may be that we may need to postpone and look at this for three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| and get everybody on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| We've accomplished about everything that we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| We just got to have, we need to have the language in place what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| I guess I'm just trying to figure out what exactly do we have on the table right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10130)|
| 2:48:56| I think we introduced any of Commissioner Leuthold's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| All we have is a substitute motion to approve as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| So if that fails, then we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| Our options are if the maker of the second substitute motion would withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| to defer until the next meeting, which is a week earlier next month due to the holiday, Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10155)|
| 2:49:22| And we're not meeting on the fourth or meeting on the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| That's what I guess I was trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| So I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| But at this point, we can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| I can't make another substitute motion on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| I guess I'll just ask, will the maker of the substitute motion like to withdraw with that in mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10173)|
| 2:49:43| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| The law director wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10184)|
| 2:50:14| While you're all talking, I'm going to let the mayor go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| I appreciate Commissioner Hammond's motion, but I think the idea of a deferral to the next meeting is probably a good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| before we can work through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| But let's make no mistake about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| This is not something that is designed to hurt our elderly population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| This is something that's designed to help our elderly citizens, not hurt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| It allows Hillcrest to do a job that they do quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10243)|
| 2:50:46| It gives them the freedom to do it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| Now, think about this for a second, what we've done over the past several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| because I don't want this point going lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| We've talked about maybe what might happen for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| Let's talk about what has already happened for seniors in our commitment going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| Here's what's already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| We've invested $6 million in a Veterans Administration nursing home that we don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| Is it a good investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| Darn right it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10269)|
| 2:51:10| If you don't think so, go out to Coward Mill Road on your way home today and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| You'll think it's a great investment after you leave because I know what's in your heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| and I know your service, that you want to serve our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| We've created a network of senior centers across this community to help take care of those who are getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10281)|
| 2:51:28| Before we didn't have hardly any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| Now we've got them in virtually every community and we're opening a new one soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| Those are good investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| For people who don't have transportation, we've arranged for them to ride CAT buses, free of charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| any route, any day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| When we had a waiting list for mobile meals, we stepped up and we took care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| Not as a mayor, not as a county commission, but as an entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| We're going to continue to do the same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| The people at Hillcrest are good folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| They have a great board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| They have a dedication to serving those from all walks of life in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| So if we need to defer for 30 days to make people feel better, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| But make no mistake about it, it is not anyone's intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| certainly not mine, I know it's not Hillcrest, and I'm confident it's not yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| that we're going to be taking privileges away from citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| Now, in terms of what we're selling the building for, we want to sell it for a price that enables them to continue to do their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| mission and do it well while allowing the county to recoup some of its investment at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10341)|
| 2:52:27| We've had lots of negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| We can go back, I think, and they've already agreed to the 62 percent of Medicaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10349)|
| 2:52:32| Medicare mix, which Carolyn has already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| So we can work through this if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| But I don't want the citizens who are listening today to think that we're not taking care of our seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| because the fact of the matter is we are and we're going to do even more in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| So I appreciate the support you've given to those other initiatives in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| and I hope this will just be one more step to ensure we keep doing good things for our country's greatest generation going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10369)|
| 2:52:56| So if we need a 30-day deferral, Commissioner Hammond, to the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| the administration will get with the Hillcrest people, address the concerns that are laid out here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| and we can do that rather quickly, I think, because all of our hearts are in the right spot to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| So if that makes people feel better, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| But this is a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| The folks at Hillcrest are good folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| They want to do what's best for our seniors, and they've been doing that job quite well for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| If Mr. Pinkston will agree to withdraw his motion, I will withdraw mine, and we will go for a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10399)|
| 2:53:28| Because he made the original motion to deny, I made a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| So I'm willing to withdraw mine if he will withdraw his, and we'll have a 30-day deferral and bring it back up next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10412)|
| 2:53:40| Mine was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| Did yours get second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10422)|
| 2:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| I'd like to, Mr. Chairman, there's a couple of people here that would like to speak on this, if it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| Would you two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10430)|
| 2:53:51| Let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| Before I decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| I haven't heard this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10434)|
| 2:53:55| I haven't heard this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| Before I decide about my motion, the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10436)|
| 2:54:12| BJ, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| My name is Dolores Moyer, and I'm a nursing home administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10454)|
| 2:54:19| I did work at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10459)|
| 2:54:20| BJ, address, too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| 169 Glassboro Drive, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| I did work for the Hillcrest communities for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| And I was amazed when I first went to work there that they said they leased the property for $1 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10470)|
| 2:54:38| Because the going rate for lease, like right now I run a 95-bed nursing facility that leases $28,000 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10478)|
| 2:54:49| that we have to pay for lease of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| And we still make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| The average number or percentage of people who are on Medicaid across the country runs from 65 to 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10494)|
| 2:55:04| And that's ongoing all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| So it's not any different at Hillcrest than it is anyplace else, except they do have a very good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10508)|
| 2:55:17| Now, that property is worth probably $45,000 per bed, which total is about $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10517)|
| 2:55:29| So it is very under-evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| So I think this deal is very bad for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| And for the life of me, I don't know why anyone would want to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10536)|
| 2:55:44| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| We have one more that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| I believe he's changed his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| She covered everything, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| Commissioner Hammond, I guess it's on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10555)|
| 2:56:04| I'll withdraw if you're withdrawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10564)|
| 2:56:05| I'll withdraw mine if you agree and we'll defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| Motion that we defer this item to our next meeting and ask that the law director get with Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10569)|
| 2:56:17| and negotiate out the terms of a deed restriction that keeps the points that we had talked about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10577)|
| 2:56:32| in the meeting about the mix of patients and taking care of the Medicare-Medicare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10592)|
| 2:56:42| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Mr. Law Director, one of the things that bothers me about the sale is if they do dissolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| and privatize and become for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| I would like to see something in there that if they do do that step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| I would like to see that the county be paid full compensation when the new company takes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10625)|
| 2:57:10| and that the county doesn't --they don't profit off the county's sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| Or the right to buy it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| Well, the deed restrictions can be set up two different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10637)|
| 2:57:22| You can have what's called a reverter where if the deed restrictions are not observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10642)|
| 2:57:30| the title to the property would revert to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| Or you can have deed restrictions so that if the use is not observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10655)|
| 2:57:42| then the county could recover damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| And the damages could be set in a way that would do exactly what you just suggested, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10666)|
| 2:57:55| Either way is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| I think we need to either recover the full cost so this is not a deal where if Hillcrest does dissolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10676)|
| 2:58:02| that the county has sold this at a bargain basement price and the profiteer starts making money off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10682)|
| 2:58:07| I just want to make sure that Knox County is not taken advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| and that Hillcrest does continue to perform their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10691)|
| 2:58:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| I guess since we're kind of given input for what things we'd like to kind of see you all discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10704)|
| 2:58:30| and talk about in this 30-day window, one of the things that concerns me, I guess, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10710)|
| 2:58:37| sending it to a private entity is the board makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| Right now it sounds like there's just lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10721)|
| 2:58:46| I don't mean it in too negative of a way, but there's an incestuous process by where they kind of choose their own replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10726)|
| 2:58:54| I think in time that could, you know, if we don't dot every I and cross every T, like Commissioner Pinkson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10734)|
| 2:59:02| as far as giving numbers, enforcing numbers, and enforcing their hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| that in time the board makeup could shift in a direction that the county, frankly, wouldn't be best served by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10745)|
| 2:59:14| So, as you all are talking, Mr. Law Director, I think that's something that needs to be how those board members are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10754)|
| 2:59:21| I don't want to get too far into their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| However, this is a sweetheart of a deal in terms of assets and, you know, they provide a valuable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10763)|
| 2:59:31| But that's one thing I'd like you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| And that's something, I guess, that can be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| But I do think that in light of those comments, I need to point out that with a not-for-profit corporation, which Hillcrest is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10778)|
| 2:59:49| that this method of choosing board members is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10789)|
| 2:59:55| It's because they're not shareholders to attend a meeting to elect board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10795)|
| 3:00:01| So this is typically how it is done because the people that serve on the boards of non-profit corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10801)|
| 3:00:09| are typically people who are involved in the community and are willing to contribute their time and do so on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10809)|
| 3:00:19| And those types of charitable organizations tend to perpetuate themselves with the interest of people who are willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10819)|
| 3:00:29| Mr. Law Director, is it possible that we could ask that a member of the commission be a board member of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10829)|
| 3:00:39| It never hurts to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| Well, I think that might be something we should negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| I mean, we sit on the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| We sit on, you know, we have different entities that commissioners are a set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10846)|
| 3:00:56| You know, we assign a commissioner to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| And I think if we're selling it, giving it like McKenzie says, a sweetheart deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| I don't think it would be too much to ask that whether it be a certain position or that we just assign a certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10865)|
| 3:01:13| that we be able to maybe put a commissioner and sit on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| And like you said, it's people that are involved in the community and wants what's best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10878)|
| 3:01:25| I think a commissioner would be a good asset for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| Again, I'll be happy to raise that issue and we'll talk about that in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| That's something that Hillcrest would like to see and is willing to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| Perhaps their bylaws can be amended to provide for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10901)|
| 3:01:51| Mr. Law Director, would they have to sunshine this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10914)|
| 3:01:56| Would you have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| I was just going to say we could certainly, at a December board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| bring up a proposed bylaw amendment to currently it's a 12-seat board that is fully, is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10922)|
| 3:02:12| We'd be happy to entertain either some kind of liaison position or amend the bylaws for a 13th seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10932)|
| 3:02:19| Well, 13th and that gives you that tiebreaker instead of being an odd number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10939)|
| 3:02:25| I mean, you'd be an odd number instead of an even number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| We'd love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| We have a motion on the floor to defer until the next meeting, which will be three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10955)|

| 3:02:40| Mr. Chairman, can we take a short break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10960)|
| 3:02:47| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=10967)|

| 3:04:28| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11070)|
| 3:04:31| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| With the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11074)|
| 3:04:35| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11075)|
| 3:04:36| What is the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11076)|
| 3:04:37| The amendment was that, I mean, and what I'm getting at here is I don't want to make these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11077)|
| 3:04:41| information if we're not going to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| So I felt like that, you know, my amendment would be is that this commission form a small ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11084)|
| 3:04:51| to review the devices that they have, what they're paying for them, their usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11091)|
| 3:04:57| and then advise them, give them, again, you know, nothing carved in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11097)|
| 3:05:02| You know, these are independent offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| But advise them on where we think their appropriate use of devices is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11105)|
| 3:05:12| and where we think that maybe it might not be appropriate or maybe they could save some money if they did something a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11117)|
| 3:05:18| I just hate to ask these folks to compile the information and go to the trouble to compile the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11118)|
| 3:05:25| if we don't have an entity in place to somehow advise them on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11125)|
| 3:05:31| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| I obviously wouldn't ask for it if we didn't intend to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| I think that as we look at our budgets next year, it should be a fairly easy thing for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| They should know who has BlackBerrys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| They should know who has the cell phones and they should have contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| The reason I brought this up is because I'd asked Mr. Myers to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| I didn't want to go this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11148)|
| 3:05:49| He informed me that he was having difficulty in getting people to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| So that's why I brought the resolution forward is when you ask for it and you don't get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11153)|
| 3:05:57| then you say, well, let's make sure we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11157)|
| 3:06:00| This is just basic information for us to look at for budgeting purposes next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| but I certainly do not have a problem with some type of committee to advise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11164)|
| 3:06:08| But I think as we do budgets, as we see the information we get back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| we might want to do it a little more than just advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| How many folks do you think we should put on a committee like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11175)|
| 3:06:19| I was thinking about three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11179)|
| 3:06:20| I would say no more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| No more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| Any volunteers for that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| You need to come on up here and sit up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11188)|
| 3:06:35| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| Since I do work for the Knox County Trustee's Office, I am going to recuse myself from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| Yes, this is getting out of our realm a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| But if we do our job, just like this year when we approved the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| when I asked for a 2% cut across the board, these people would get rid of these frills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| There's probably a lot of other things out there we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| We need to start really looking at the budget instead of coming back and nitpicking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| If we'd cut it 2%, if somebody had one of these cell phones out there that didn't need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11229)|
| 3:07:13| it would be turned in, I'll guarantee you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11235)|
| 3:07:16| And I'm going to excuse myself because my wife works in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11236)|
| 3:07:20| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| I was just going to remind people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| I don't know if everyone is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| Myself and Commissioner Saunders and Commissioner Wright sit on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| We're going to be looking at the, I think, the vehicle situation here in a month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11250)|
| 3:07:36| That was started before I got on the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| And I think that's an excellent situation to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| We have a separate Vehicle Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| It's myself and Mr. Hammond and Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| I know it is going to come to our committee just to talk about or to look at and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| And I would hope it would also come to the Audit Committee for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11272)|
| 3:08:00| I'm thinking, do we really need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| Audits will probably come to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11283)|
| 3:08:06| What if we just send the information to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| I mean, but is the information going with some meat to it or is there just going to be a list of 500 names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11288)|
| 3:08:18| and BlackBerry, Verizon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| It would seem to me that if they're ought to do a good job in auditing this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11300)|
| 3:08:27| they need to understand are these phones necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| So if we just send it to the Audit Committee, just a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| I'm just trying to understand what exactly are they charged with doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11314)|
| 3:08:40| I think they would be charged with looking at how these phones are needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11320)|
| 3:08:48| Well, also the cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| I mean, things like text messaging, what types of costs are we getting, what types of providers are we getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11330)|
| 3:08:56| the competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| I mean, there's a lot involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| My sense is that the bill for Knox County is probably a pretty decent bill each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11339)|
| 3:09:05| when you look at all of the information that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| And I think we just need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| My whole point in doing these is so that we don't wait until May of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| and then all of a sudden we get a budget in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| If we've got information now that we can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11356)|
| 3:09:19| then it's going to help us make these decisions that Commissioner Pinkson was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| because I think we're going to have to make some tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| So are you okay with sending it to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| Yes, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| I just want some eyes looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| And I do think that asking for the information, I think that what's going to happen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11373)|
| 3:09:39| that the various department heads, as they compile this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| I think they'll probably self-police a little bit and say, you know, I didn't realize they had a phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11384)|
| 3:09:49| They don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| I think we may, just by asking for the information, cut these bills down just a little bit by giving the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11390)|
| 3:09:57| an opportunity to look at it themselves as they compile it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11397)|
| 3:10:04| So the motion is to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| Send it to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11414)|
| 3:10:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11415)|
| 3:10:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| Recusals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| We have two recusals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11420)|
| 3:10:25| 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| This is a resolution extending the 120-day moratorium on electronic billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| to six months, expiring March 31, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11436)|
| 3:10:37| Voted to approve 6-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11441)|
| 3:10:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11442)|
| 3:10:43| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| I would like to make a substitute motion on this to make this a permanent and total ban on new billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11447)|
| 3:10:54| The reason I would like to do this is that I saw recently that Tennessee was now the tenth most visited state by tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11454)|
| 3:11:02| and that East Tennessee was the fastest growing region of Tennessee within the state for the tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11462)|
| 3:11:11| And people are coming to East Tennessee not to look at our billboards, but they're coming to look at the natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| If you go to New York City and I go down to Times Square, I expect to see billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| And if they took all the billboards down, all I would be seeing is the ugly buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11482)|
| 3:11:27| If you go to Las Vegas, you expect to see the electronic billboards and all the jazzy, fancy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| But when you come to East Tennessee, you're coming here to look at the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| and all that the billboards do is that they mar the countryside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11496)|
| 3:11:41| What we need to do is that we need to showcase our best asset, which is the natural beauty that we've been blessed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11501)|
| 3:11:48| And for that reason, I would like to have a total ban on the new billboards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11508)|
| 3:11:53| If you don't think that it makes a difference, just take a drive between Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| and Interstate 40 on the Pellissippi Parkway and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| And I think you'll see what I mean where there are no billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11523)|
| 3:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| Do you have a 52 motion to make a permanent ban on new billboards in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11531)|
| 3:12:22| All billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11542)|
| 3:12:23| All billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11543)|
| 3:12:24| All new billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| I might mention the city did this several years ago, so this is not a radical idea that came out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11549)|
| 3:12:35| I'll keep my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11557)|
| 3:12:38| Law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| Can we do this with a simple resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| I would think that this would require an ordinance that requires two ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11564)|
| 3:12:49| This is a pretty significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| It would require an ordinance because we already have an ordinance on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11573)|
| 3:13:00| And there are significant legal issues associated with a total and permanent ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11580)|
| 3:13:08| This is something that would need to be, I think, studied and considerable thought put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11588)|
| 3:13:21| My office would be happy to defend litigation on a total and permanent ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11601)|
| 3:13:27| but I think we need to take the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| If it's the sentiment of this commission that that's what Knox County wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11611)|
| 3:13:38| then let's take a step back and put some thought into doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11618)|
| 3:13:48| The moratorium, I thought, was to study just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11628)|
| 3:13:56| And I think that's something that and I understand the commissioner's sentiment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11636)|
| 3:14:02| but number one, I don't think we can do it tonight by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| And if this body desires that that be the policy of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11647)|
| 3:14:14| then we need to put some considerable thought and study into how to go about doing it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11654)|
| 3:14:22| With that, I'd like to make the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| There was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| I'm going to let Mr. McDonald, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11672)|
| 3:14:33| Mark Donaldson with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| The current regulations regarding billboards are embedded in the sign code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| which is a part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| In order to amend that zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| you would at a minimum have to cycle through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| And based on the city's experience when they placed a ban on new billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11688)|
| 3:14:54| a citizen-driven planning process would be, I would argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11694)|
| 3:15:00| for that sort of a process to be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11700)|
| 3:15:05| But you certainly could initiate it with some sort of a resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11705)|
| 3:15:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11711)|
| 3:15:12| I was just going to echo what our law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| Being in that business a little bit, just by taking action here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| we're going to open ourselves up to a Pandora's box of issues I don't think we want to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11720)|
| 3:15:25| And I understand where Commissioner Briggs is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| At the very least, we do have an industry here in town that provides employment for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11727)|
| 3:15:32| And I think that they deserve an opportunity to be here to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| and to discuss it and to present their side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| And so I would just, there's no way that I could support right now just a total ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| without extending that courtesy, but also looking at the legal ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11745)|
| 3:15:50| And also, I know the Board of Zoning Appeals has also taken issue with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| And so I think there are too many questions here for us to answer without taking a permanent ban on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| Let me just mention that I asked and I have talked to Mr. Jernigan, who is the regional director for the Lamar Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11761)|
| 3:16:09| And he said he was not going to come down here and he was not going to talk with anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11769)|
| 3:16:12| because he had been abused, to use his words, during the hearings for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11772)|
| 3:16:17| And he wasn't going to come down here and talk about it because I offered for him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11777)|
| 3:16:22| I would still maintain, though, that to have it right now to say a total ban, I think we should at least defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11782)|
| 3:16:29| Let's get some legal options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| And if they choose not to do so, then that's their option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| And that was really why I wanted to have a moratorium and a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| But I think we can start the process right now that maybe at least get a sentiment on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| if this is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| I do realize that this is a major step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| I also would like to point out that there's four states that ban billboards completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11807)|
| 3:16:54| The city of Knoxville has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| There's other cities and counties in California and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| There's many places that have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| So we can use their ordinances and their state laws as a model for ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11821)|
| 3:17:06| So it's not something where we're reinventing or trying to invent the wheel because the wheel has already been invented on how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11826)|
| 3:17:13| But I think there's plenty of precedent before on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| But I do agree that we want to do it and we want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| And I'm not opposed to, you know, for us to go a little bit slower just as we mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11839)|
| 3:17:27| from the Metropolitan Planning Commission representative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| But I think that's something that we really ought to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| We're in a unique situation here in Knox County and in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| And I just think it's a shame for us to mar, you know, one of the assets that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11858)|
| 3:17:44| There's a lot more people employed in the tourism industry than there are in the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| And I think what we need to do is we really need to showcase one of our best assets, which is the natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| And that's really why I want to, why I propose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| So you're wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| We can have, I believe, and I can ask this to the law director, we can have a resolution to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11882)|
| 3:18:08| I believe it does not carry the weight of law since it's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11888)|
| 3:18:12| But I believe we could vote on a resolution this evening, couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11892)|
| 3:18:17| A resolution for a total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| I guess what I should say to maybe have a resolution to start the process of banning new billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11900)|
| 3:18:34| Mr. Briggs, Commissioner Briggs, the resolution tonight states that enact a 120-day moratorium, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11914)|
| 3:18:46| on electronic billboards to allow Knox County to study the use of electronic billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11926)|
| 3:18:51| or receive public input and consider amendments to Section 3.90 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11931)|
| 3:18:58| which regulates the use of electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11938)|
| 3:19:01| So I think that it already addresses the issues that you're wanting to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11941)|
| 3:19:09| I simply recommend going ahead and going forward with the way it's written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11949)|
| 3:19:15| and then when it comes back, then we can see what they have to say and try to go from that point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11955)|
| 3:19:24| Yeah, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| The reason we had a, I can't remember if it was a 90- or 100-day moratorium already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| And the reason I wanted to extend it was because there's now a lawsuit between Lamar and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11970)|
| 3:19:37| See, the city has a total ban already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11977)|
| 3:19:40| And I didn't want us to start workshops and public hearings on anything until we saw how that lawsuit was going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11980)|
| 3:19:49| But in the meantime, what I would like to do, rather than just banning the electronic billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11989)|
| 3:19:54| I would just like to ban all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| And I think we need to start the process of making that a permanent, rather than a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=11996)|
| 3:20:01| making it a permanent ban on all new billboards, not just the electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12001)|
| 3:20:10| I guess you could change the language within this that says, talks about electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12010)|
| 3:20:17| Just drop the electronic and say billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| Just have all billboards, including electronic, because I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12019)|
| 3:20:24| Let's just say all billboards, because I think right now the codes are really no different for electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| In the county, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| In the city, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12033)|
| 3:20:34| I would like to, because I want whoever is studying this to specifically look at electronic billboards as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12034)|
| 3:20:42| because I think there needs to be a differential between the two in case we don't ban all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12042)|
| 3:20:51| So I would like whoever is studying this to make sure that they come back with, if we want to ban all future billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12051)|
| 3:21:02| this is what you do if you want to ban electronic billboards only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| or do whatever we feel like doing with just electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12067)|
| 3:21:12| I want that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| I think we can do that, but I really think I would at least like to get a sense from this body as to whether we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12076)|
| 3:21:23| like to ban all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| Because I personally think that they're all nothing but mar our greatest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12085)|
| 3:21:35| And I'll mention that I'm meeting on Friday with the president of Scenic America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12095)|
| 3:21:41| you know, the president of the national organization on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| and he's bringing a lot of information on what's been done in other communities on this same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12103)|
| 3:21:53| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| I guess I'm just trying to --it sounds like we're requesting a lot of stuff from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12118)|
| 3:22:05| from Mr. Donaldson and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12125)|
| 3:22:10| Is 120 days, is that enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12130)|
| 3:22:13| Actually, change it from 120 to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| 180 is what the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12137)|
| 3:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12138)|
| 3:22:19| So that was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12139)|
| 3:22:20| Until the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| I guess I'll look to those two departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| Is that enough time for us to get a comprehensive assessment of what we can and can't do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12147)|
| 3:22:36| Speaking for the law department, yes, that's enough time for us to report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12156)|
| 3:22:44| I guess, and I will, and my department will do whatever the sense of the commission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12164)|
| 3:22:54| but I would ask if possible before we, because it will take a significant amount of resources to dedicate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12174)|
| 3:23:09| number one, determining the legality of a total and permanent band, and number two, how to structure it so that it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12189)|
| 3:23:18| withstand a legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| And before doing that, I'd hate for us to go through that exercise and then find out that all of commission was opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12201)|
| 3:23:33| that idea in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12213)|
| 3:23:36| But, you know, we'll do it if that's what you'd like for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12216)|
| 3:23:43| From the respect of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12223)|
| 3:23:46| given that we've recently gone through a similar process in the city regarding digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12226)|
| 3:23:52| and six or seven years ago went through the process to ban new billboards altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| You know, the research is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| That's not the time-consuming part at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12241)|
| 3:24:04| It would be the public meeting process, but I think six months probably is a very manageable time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12244)|
| 3:24:15| Can I make one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12255)|
| 3:24:16| There's two issues here that we really have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| And we do have to look at the electronic billboard issue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| The first is, do we want to ban all new billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| And the second is because the way the codes are written now for the county is that they can make the conversion of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12267)|
| 3:24:34| standard billboards, and this wouldn't be affected by the new billboard ban, to electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| And so we really have to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12280)|
| 3:24:44| One, whether or not we want to ban all new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| And then, secondly, what we want to do to regulate the present billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| and their conversion from their present fashion to the electronic fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12292)|
| 3:24:58| So there's really two issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| And in certain ways, they're separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| Mr. Donaldson, would you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| Dr. Briggs, have you thought about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12308)|
| 3:25:11| And we dealt with this on MPC, and I don't know if this is what the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| But if one blows down, you know, you're talking about let's say there's in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12315)|
| 3:25:21| let's say there's 300 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| And if one falls down, whatever, can that one be replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| Or, you know, could it be replaced in North Knoxville if it was in West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| Are you just wanting to keep the numbers the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| Or because what's going to happen over the years, they'll get less and less and less and less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| and maybe 50 years from now there'll be none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| I mean, what was your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| I'll tell you really what my intent would be, and we can do anything we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| You know, there's different, I guess there's different mechanisms that various communities have used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12344)|
| 3:25:49| One is called amateurization, where over, they say, a ten-year period, they're going to phase out all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12349)|
| 3:25:55| And I'm really not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| I think if one blew down in the same location, they could replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| But as roads are widened, as property is sold and new buildings are put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| and billboards are taken down, those would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| And they would not be able to replace it someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| It would have to be on the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12371)|
| 3:26:12| I mean, that's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12372)|
| 3:26:14| What's your feeling on that from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12374)|
| 3:26:16| What's MPC think on a scenario like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12376)|
| 3:26:20| Well, I think Dr. Briggs has described it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| The state law provides for the reconstruction and even the enhancement of certain business improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12383)|
| 3:26:31| through its grandfathering laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| So billboard owners and owners of property who have billboards have the right to continue that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12393)|
| 3:26:41| at the same location with the same sort of structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12401)|
| 3:26:45| The city was able to prevail at the local level with regard to upgrading an existing standard billboard to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12405)|
| 3:26:56| digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| They've kept that from happening, and that's currently going to be litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| So there are mechanisms in place to handle that, and there are policy decisions that the community can choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12423)|
| 3:27:11| as it goes towards making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| So when I left that committee, I think it was in the city, it was 286.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12434)|
| 3:27:19| But if one fell down somewhere, say in West Knoxville, and they wanted to put it north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| they had to keep the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12444)|
| 3:27:25| They could never exceed that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| Now, has that changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| That isn't the current regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| They cannot construct a new billboard on a new site, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12453)|
| 3:27:38| But they can replace an existing billboard if it's damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| There are some communities that have adopted no net increase in the number of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12462)|
| 3:27:51| but that's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| The city's experience, I think, has been that over the time since they approved the ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12474)|
| 3:28:00| there has been a reduction of 10 to 15 percent of the number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12480)|
| 3:28:08| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12490)|
| 3:28:11| I'd like to absolutely echo what Dr. Briggs has to say about billboards, both digital and all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12491)|
| 3:28:23| The question, I guess, comes now in reference to this discussion is can the moratorium act by resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12503)|
| 3:28:35| Can we act to ban both digital and any new construction in the six-month period while we're doing the study, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12515)|
| 3:28:47| So is that what's before us right now as we try to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12527)|
| 3:28:52| and try to give Dr. Briggs some idea of where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12532)|
| 3:28:57| You know, I guess from what I've heard, and the law director can correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12537)|
| 3:29:02| or the chairman can correct me, is I think you can make an amendment to the present one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12542)|
| 3:29:09| if we decide this is the best way to add to ban all new billboards for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12549)|
| 3:29:15| make that an amendment to the one banning the conversion to electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12555)|
| 3:29:21| I believe that would be legal, and I would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12561)|
| 3:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| I would like to make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12566)|
| 3:29:32| I guess first, I guess, did he ever get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12572)|
| 3:29:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12577)|
| 3:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12578)|
| 3:29:39| Yeah, he's got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12579)|
| 3:29:40| He's got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| He would need to withdraw because his motion, his substitute motion is not what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| If you withdraw, then if Paul and I accept that amendment as a friendly amendment, then we're good, which I'll be happy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12586)|
| 3:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12596)|
| 3:29:59| Paul, do you want to withdraw your substitute admission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12599)|
| 3:30:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| So where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12604)|
| 3:30:05| That brings us back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| Are you okay with it, too, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12608)|
| 3:30:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12609)|
| 3:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| Are you willing to take that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| And so am I as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12613)|
| 3:30:14| So now we're at the original motion as amended that we ban or we have a moratorium on all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12614)|
| 3:30:24| Digital and new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12624)|
| 3:30:25| Yeah, all billboards, digital and new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| and then we'll have a study on conversion to electronic and also a study on whether or not to build any more billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12627)|
| 3:30:36| It will do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12636)|
| 3:30:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| Up until the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12640)|
| 3:30:41| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12641)|
| 3:30:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| Are you through, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12644)|
| 3:30:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12645)|
| 3:30:46| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| I hope we really take our time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| I do believe, I mean, I'm one of the few on here that acknowledge that billboards have a place in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12652)|
| 3:30:59| You know, Dr. Briggs, I understand heart surgeons don't use billboards to advertise on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12659)|
| 3:31:05| Gastroenterologists do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| But there's a lot of small businesses out there that, in order to be heard, they have to use something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12667)|
| 3:31:17| When you're driving down the road and you see the golden arches, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12677)|
| 3:31:24| you automatically know what that means because McDonald's has backed up that very pleasant little sign, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12684)|
| 3:31:32| with a national advertising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| Now, we'll say Humphammers, for instance, one of the places in the sixth district where I like to eat lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12696)|
| 3:31:42| You know, folks are not going to understand what Humphammers Market in Delhi is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| unless he uses some sort of a billboard type advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| So, you know, billboards have their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| I do believe that they need to be heavily regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12714)|
| 3:31:57| I don't think everybody needs to have one in their front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12717)|
| 3:32:01| But I think we need to go very slow and we need to be very cautious and understand that, you know, billboards are not all bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12721)|
| 3:32:09| They do have their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12729)|
| 3:32:10| There are some businesses that really depend on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| And these electronic billboards are not bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| In fact, I think that, you know, I do think we need to regulate the number of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12737)|
| 3:32:23| but I would prefer to see more billboards replaced with these electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| Number one, more people have the opportunity to advertise on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12748)|
| 3:32:35| And number two, if they're ever needed for public service announcements, Amber Alerts, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| Lamar has been very generous to donate space on electronic billboards for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12761)|
| 3:32:47| So while I do believe that they need to be regulated, I don't believe that billboards are the evil of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12767)|
| 3:32:54| And I think we need to be very cautious and we need to write regulations that acknowledge the right of the billboard companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12774)|
| 3:33:02| to conduct their business, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| balancing that with the right of the citizens to not have their view obscured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12785)|
| 3:33:10| So I just think we need to be real careful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12790)|
| 3:33:13| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12793)|
| 3:33:17| Commissioner Briggs, if you wanted to know how commissioners were feeling on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12797)|
| 3:33:22| I support a ban on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12802)|
| 3:33:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12808)|
| 3:33:32| The going up Interstate 81, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, you don't know what's in Maryland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12812)|
| 3:33:41| so I don't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| I believe, as we've had pointed out, some billboards are okay and some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12824)|
| 3:33:51| Really, what my question is going to be about, what are we doing during this six-month window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12831)|
| 3:33:57| Are billboards still going to be constructed where permits exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12837)|
| 3:34:03| If this passes, it will be a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12843)|
| 3:34:07| But so someone was approved this week to put up a huge billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12847)|
| 3:34:15| and I would assume it's probably time-consuming and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12855)|
| 3:34:19| there's some time lag between the time you start and the time it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| Are we saying that as of tomorrow, you've got to stop where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| Ask your question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| Sir, ask your question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| I'm asking if we pass what we have before us right now, someone is, well, they've been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12873)|
| 3:34:44| and their billboard is on a rail car headed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12884)|
| 3:34:48| Do they have to turn the car around and send the sign back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12888)|
| 3:34:52| I think under those circumstances, in order to avoid litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12892)|
| 3:35:02| and the correct legal thing to do would be to allow that billboard to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| The same thing holds true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12907)|
| 3:35:08| I was just discussing this with the deputy law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| If you're talking about a moratorium on all billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12912)|
| 3:35:20| you can very easily have a circumstance where a billboard that's in existence today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12920)|
| 3:35:28| that falls due to the weather or something like that, will this moratorium apply to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12928)|
| 3:35:35| I don't think it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| I think the moratorium should only apply to new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12937)|
| 3:35:44| that has not already been permitted or approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12944)|
| 3:35:50| Again, it's also very important, and I realize that there is a time limit on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12950)|
| 3:35:58| but that time limit needs to be strictly observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12958)|
| 3:36:05| up to the charge that we're trying to ban billboards with a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12965)|
| 3:36:14| So I think this moratorium can be effective and it's legal as long as it applies to new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12974)|
| 3:36:31| and those that have not already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12991)|
| 3:36:37| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12997)|
| 3:36:38| Yes, this applies just to new, is the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| I think the question, though, raises the issue of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13003)|
| 3:36:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13007)|
| 3:36:52| I don't see any other lights on, so we can just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13012)|
| 3:36:57| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13021)|
| 3:37:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13024)|
| 3:37:08| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| You got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| Motion passes 14-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13033)|
| 3:37:19| 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| This is a resolution to create a task force to address issues related to the transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13041)|

| 3:37:41| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13061)|
| 3:37:42| Thanks, Commissioner Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13062)|
| 3:37:44| I'd like to put for the fifth district, I'd like to make a nomination, John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13064)|
| 3:37:52| And I think if any of the other districts have someone they'd like to nominate, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| we should ask each of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| Do we need a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13080)|
| 3:38:01| I think it's just an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13084)|
| 3:38:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13085)|
| 3:38:06| I don't think we need a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13086)|
| 3:38:09| So your name would be John Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13091)|
| 3:38:12| For the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13092)|
| 3:38:13| I guess your other fifth district people are okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| You'd have to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| Aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| John Schoonmaker for the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| I think John is an excellent choice for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13103)|
| 3:38:27| You're going to have a hard time finding anyone more interested and knowledgeable than he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13107)|
| 3:38:31| I can't say enough to endorse Commissioner Lutho's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13111)|
| 3:38:37| Commissioner McKenzie has the rights for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13117)|
| 3:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13120)|
| 3:38:41| So whenever he comes up with a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| Does anyone have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| The second district has a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| We'd like to nominate or appoint Bob Lofenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13130)|
| 3:38:56| Same with you, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13139)|
| 3:39:00| We've got from the third district Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13140)|
| 3:39:06| Is she okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13146)|
| 3:39:08| Commissioner Schaaf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13148)|
| 3:39:09| Mr. Chairman, the fourth district would like to nominate James Jim Blattner, Sequoia Hills resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13149)|
| 3:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13158)|
| 3:39:19| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| Yes, the ninth district would like to appoint Victoria DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13161)|
| 3:39:26| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| Do we have to have these names on here before we take up the discussing the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13169)|
| 3:39:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13175)|
| 3:39:39| Lisa Starbuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13179)|
| 3:39:44| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13184)|
| 3:39:46| The sixth district would like to nominate Kenny Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13186)|
| 3:39:51| We still have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13191)|
| 3:39:57| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| I'd like to put Chris Edders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13199)|
| 3:40:06| We have everyone except for the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13206)|
| 3:40:08| The first will probably get theirs in a few days and get it to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| We still have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13212)|
| 3:40:15| All those in favor to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13217)|
| 3:40:20| Any nays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13220)|
| 3:40:24| Wright voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| Passes 16-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13226)|
| 3:40:33| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| This is a resolution amending the Knox County Commission rules to provide procedures for reorganization of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13235)|
| 3:40:42| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13242)|
| 3:40:44| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13244)|
| 3:40:45| 9-11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13245)|
| 3:40:46| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| Intergovernmental, no recommendation, 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| Finance, 10-0, no recommendation, but I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| We have a rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13257)|
| 3:41:01| Do you want to make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13261)|
| 3:41:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13262)|
| 3:41:03| What did the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| I think we decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13266)|
| 3:41:07| What was it, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| We decided to go ahead and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13268)|
| 3:41:09| 3-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13269)|
| 3:41:10| 3-0-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| Yes, the rules was 3-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| Two members were not present, so basically they were unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| Basically, what this is, is it just puts in writing what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13286)|
| 3:41:31| When our chairman called us to order, it calls for the committee on committees to meet here behind these microphones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13291)|
| 3:41:37| in full view of the camera, and then the chairman to take over intergovernmental until there is a chairman elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13297)|
| 3:41:42| Then he steps aside and also finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| So this just makes it a part of our rules so that there's no confusion when we have to do this once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13305)|
| 3:41:54| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13314)|
| 3:41:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| This is a resolution amending the Knox County Commission rules to allow for the finance committee meeting to begin at 8.30 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13323)|
| 3:42:09| and the intergovernmental committee meeting to begin at 10.30 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13329)|
| 3:42:13| both on the Monday one week prior to the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13333)|
| 3:42:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| The vote is to deny 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13340)|
| 3:42:22| No recommendation 10-0, but I make a motion to approve with the amendment of the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13342)|
| 3:42:30| Rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13350)|
| 3:42:34| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| Do we have a second to Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13358)|
| 3:42:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13362)|
| 3:42:48| I didn't see who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13368)|
| 3:42:52| I was just going to ask what the amendment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13372)|
| 3:42:56| I think it was to move it to 10.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13376)|
| 3:42:58| The intergovernmental would meet at 10.30 to 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13378)|
| 3:43:02| The reason we brought this before the rules committee was because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13382)|
| 3:43:06| we have several people that have come to the finance committee meeting and also the intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| And for both of you, the same day that these people come in and also help the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| people have to show up to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| Gets it all done in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13397)|
| 3:43:22| Commissioner Knopf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13402)|
| 3:43:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13405)|
| 3:43:26| Intergovernmental acknowledges possibly the efficiency of doing it all in one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13406)|
| 3:43:32| but we tended to, we were unanimous that we liked going the second day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13412)|
| 3:43:37| and having the ability to review what was done the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13417)|
| 3:43:44| given the finance committee is kind of chomping at the bit to get this thing getting in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13424)|
| 3:43:50| So we liked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| So I'd like to, for the rest of the board, to consider our vote of 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13437)|
| 3:44:00| Commissioner Brawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13440)|
| 3:44:00| Just I wanted to echo what Tony said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13440)|
| 3:44:04| Those of us on intergovernmental really prefer to meet the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| And we understand, like he said, the efficiency of doing it all in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| But I think it's better for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13452)|
| 3:44:16| and it's better for the people we represent to have it spread out over two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13456)|
| 3:44:21| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13461)|
| 3:44:24| In echoing what fellow members of the intergovernmental committee have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13474)|
| 3:44:38| Commissioner Pinkham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13479)|
| 3:44:40| My understanding is this room has to be set up in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13480)|
| 3:44:45| and we have some conflicts that need to be here on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13485)|
| 3:44:50| We haven't had any since we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| No, but there are some people that I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| We haven't had any yet, but it's liable to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| You understand what I'm talking about, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| Plus, it's putting a burden on the commission office about getting these packets out on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13503)|
| 3:45:09| It's helped a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| No, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13510)|
| 3:45:11| They go out the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| We aren't using packets anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13515)|
| 3:45:16| It's all online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13516)|
| 3:45:17| But they still have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13517)|
| 3:45:18| It delays them on this even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| I realize we don't have the package out, but it delays them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| You asked Mr. Bolivetti there, Jolie, about it, and it really puts them back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13523)|
| 3:45:29| It hurts Jill in the law director's office and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13529)|
| 3:45:33| and I would suggest, you know, I don't care if you meet at midnight tonight if that's what you wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13533)|
| 3:45:40| but, you know, I just thought it would be better if you wanted to come in at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13540)|
| 3:45:43| We could have it all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| You could sit here and listen like some of them did before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| and see what the finance committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13547)|
| 3:45:52| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13552)|
| 3:45:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13553)|
| 3:45:54| Paul's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| There is the possibility of a conflict on Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13555)|
| 3:45:59| But I think that once we put out there that this commission is going to have its intergovernmental committee meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13559)|
| 3:46:08| on Tuesdays at 830 going out as far as we can see, I think we can reserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13568)|
| 3:46:16| And I think there is one out there that there is a conflict that was booked prior to us moving to Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13576)|
| 3:46:25| But, you know, as soon as we reserve it, then I think we've got it reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13585)|
| 3:46:30| And, you know, I think one of the reasons why I prefer meeting on Tuesday is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13590)|
| 3:46:38| after finance considers everything, it gives the public a chance to react a little bit to what the vote was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13598)|
| 3:46:48| and what was discussed at finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13608)|
| 3:46:51| And sometimes we hear from constituents about what you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13611)|
| 3:46:58| They may like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13618)|
| 3:46:59| They may have other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| But it gives us a chance to see what the constituents out there are thinking after this gets out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13621)|
| 3:47:11| and they have a chance to let us know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13631)|
| 3:47:15| And that's why I like having it delayed another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13635)|
| 3:47:21| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| And the last thing I'd want to do is make a hardship on Jolie or Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13644)|
| 3:47:29| There's two people I definitely don't want to offend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13649)|
| 3:47:33| But I do want to say that I think that intergovernmental's ability to go the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13653)|
| 3:47:43| Also, what we would try to do or what we have tended to do is we've not just gone over the same ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13663)|
| 3:47:50| but somewhat have used what finance has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13670)|
| 3:47:55| And the discussion has actually changed a bit and deepened in some ways, or it has, you know, an alternative route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13675)|
| 3:48:02| which I think is beneficial to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13682)|
| 3:48:05| So I just see this as helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13685)|
| 3:48:07| So, again, I'll support Mr. Lambert's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13687)|
| 3:48:14| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13694)|
| 3:48:15| Yeah, I just want to say that, you know, most legislative bodies, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| if they have separate committees, they have them on separate days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13699)|
| 3:48:23| You know, in the Congress, you'll see something being debated by one committee one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13703)|
| 3:48:27| and then a few days later it will be debated by another committee before it goes to the full floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13707)|
| 3:48:33| I don't really see any use of having two separate committees if they're on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13713)|
| 3:48:41| And with that, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13721)|
| 3:48:45| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| The motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13730)|
| 3:48:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13731)|
| 3:48:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13732)|
| 3:48:53| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13735)|
| 3:49:00| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| To deny 16-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13743)|
| 3:49:08| 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| It was passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| This resolution was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| It is extending the terms of Rex Davis, Thomas Deakins, Mike Duncan, Mike Hammond, Paul Pinkston, Frank Shanklin Sr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13755)|
| 3:49:25| Dr. Ron Stewart, Julia Tucker, and Kim Waller on the Knox County Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| until the Knox County Commission's regular November 2008 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13770)|
| 3:49:35| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13775)|
| 3:49:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13776)|
| 3:49:41| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Mr. Director, do I have to recuse since my pastor is on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13786)|
| 3:49:53| He told you, you better not vote for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13793)|
| 3:49:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| Do you know something we don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13798)|
| 3:50:00| No, I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13800)|
| 3:50:04| Is this not the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13804)|
| 3:50:07| This action has already been taken, but there was not a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13807)|
| 3:50:13| And rather than amend the minutes, we thought it was better for this to be the subject of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13813)|
| 3:50:23| So that's why it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13823)|
| 3:50:26| It's just for this one month, Craig, until we get the names of the people that are going to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13826)|
| 3:50:32| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13832)|
| 3:50:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13833)|
| 3:50:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13834)|
| 3:50:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13836)|
| 3:50:43| Let's take the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13843)|
| 3:50:46| The ordinance is amending Knox County Code Chapter 18, Article 1 in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13846)|
| 3:50:51| Section 18-1, litigation taxes to levy a $50 privilege tax on litigation in accordance with public chapter number 1187,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13851)|
| 3:51:01| Ordinance O-92-3-103, subsection 1-6, adopted June 1, 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13861)|

| 3:51:28| And governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13888)|
| 3:51:29| And governmental voted to approve 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13889)|
| 3:51:32| And it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13892)|
| 3:51:33| Approved with amendment 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| The amendment was to give $25 to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13895)|
| 3:51:39| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13899)|
| 3:51:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13900)|
| 3:51:43| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13903)|
| 3:51:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13904)|

| 3:51:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| We're going back to 9-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| This is a resolution establishing a graduated fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13912)|
| 3:51:57| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13917)|
| 3:51:58| This is a resolution requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13918)|
| 3:52:02| to review for rezoning property located at 7315 and 7347 North Freeway from Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13922)|
| 3:52:09| and Floodway to Agricultural and Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13929)|
| 3:52:13| And governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13933)|
| 3:52:14| And governmental voted to approve 7-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| And it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13937)|
| 3:52:18| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13938)|
| 3:52:19| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13939)|
| 3:52:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13944)|
| 3:52:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13946)|
| 3:52:27| We'll give your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| My name is Nathan Silvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13950)|
| 3:52:31| I live at 10065 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| And I'm one of the owners of the property in question to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13954)|
| 3:52:38| You've got five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| The resolution here only involves two properties, an 11-acre tract that is currently owned by the Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13960)|
| 3:52:46| and a 12-acre tract that is owned by myself and Lee Gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13966)|
| 3:52:50| The Legacy Parks Foundation is free to rezone their property at any time without county commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13970)|
| 3:52:56| This is nothing but an attempted condemnation of our property, the neighboring property, in the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13976)|
| 3:53:02| I have a brief presentation that explains a little bit of the history of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| and show you guys exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=13987)|
| 3:53:25| You can go ahead, sir, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14005)|
| 3:53:28| In 2005, I was hired by John Moore to produce civil engineering drawings for a commercial project he wanted to construct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14008)|
| 3:53:33| on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| At that time, the property and the adjacent property for the proposed park were in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14015)|
| 3:53:39| as low-density residential, and the zoning for both properties was agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14019)|
| 3:53:43| Working with Mr. Moore, the design we proposed in 2005 was almost identical to what we were proposing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14023)|
| 3:53:50| The concept was for a commercial center on four acres of the site and a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14030)|
| 3:53:56| John Moore took that design to then commissioners for the 7th District, Scott Moore and Mary Lou Horner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14036)|
| 3:54:01| and they agreed that it was a great idea as evidenced by the April 24, 2006, front page story in the Hall Shopper titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14041)|
| 3:54:08| Hall's Land Coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| A copy of this article is in Appendix A of the handouts you just received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14050)|
| 3:54:16| In this article, and echoed in the minutes from the county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14056)|
| 3:54:20| it stated that Moore and Horner supported the rezoning of the four acres which engineers had deemed buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14060)|
| 3:54:27| Now let's take a moment to look at John Moore's concept plan in Appendix B, the next tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14067)|
| 3:54:31| The first page shows his concept plan that takes up basically four acres of the 12-acre track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14071)|
| 3:54:38| The second page in Appendix B shows our concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14078)|
| 3:54:42| And the third page in Appendix B shows an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14082)|
| 3:54:45| John Moore's concept plan is in blue and ours is in gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14085)|
| 3:54:48| As you can see, the projects are almost identical in terms of size and scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14088)|
| 3:54:53| Back in 2005, we considered including a neighboring property that is now owned by the Legacy Parks Foundation as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14093)|
| 3:54:59| original center, but decided not to include that property because it has no usable frontage due to a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14099)|
| 3:55:05| John did not rezone the neighboring property and never had that property under contract during any of the rezoning proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| Matt Fentress executed the rezoning of the parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| And at that time, Matt Fentress was a listing agent for the sellers of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14113)|
| 3:55:18| John Moore made a request to rezone our 12 acres of property to the MPC in November of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14118)|
| 3:55:24| On the application, the applicant's proposed use was stated as commercial strip center on four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14124)|
| 3:55:29| Staff recommended approval of rezoning 4.5 acres of the site to SC Shopping Center with the following comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14129)|
| 3:55:36| SC zoning is a logical extension of the commercial zoning pattern from the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14136)|
| 3:55:41| A number of properties along the major arterial street in the area have been rezoned for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14141)|
| 3:55:46| And the staff recommendation for approval will help to preserve the ability of Beaver Creek Floodway to adequately move stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| through the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| At the MPC meeting, Commissioner Art Clancy made a motion to approve the request, and Commissioner Ray Evans seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14154)|
| 3:55:59| There was no opposition, and the approval was made by unanimous decision by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14159)|
| 3:56:04| After the MPC approval, the project passed along to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14164)|
| 3:56:08| The minutes from the April 2006 County Commission meeting are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| Commissioner Moore made a motion to approve the sector plan amendment from low-density residential to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14172)|
| 3:56:17| and Commissioner Horner seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| There was no opposition, and the sector plan was amended by unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14179)|
| 3:56:23| The very next item on that agenda in April 2006 was the rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| Commissioner Moore made a motion to approve the rezoning of the property from agricultural to shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14187)|
| 3:56:32| and Commissioner Horner seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14192)|
| 3:56:34| Again, there was no opposition and a unanimous vote in favor of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14194)|
| 3:56:38| To be very clear, the County Commission and the MPC voted unanimously to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14198)|
| 3:56:43| and unanimously to approve the rezoning of the property to SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14203)|
| 3:56:47| Based on those unanimous decisions, we have spent over $125,000 on geotechnical and environmental engineering studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14207)|
| 3:56:54| design alternatives, construction drawings, flood and floodplain studies, permits, political processes, and now lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14214)|
| 3:57:00| For whatever reason, John Moore abandoned his project in early 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14220)|
| 3:57:04| Just several months later, in October of 2007, we began to pursue the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14224)|
| 3:57:09| We found a way to make the project feasible almost exactly as John Moore had proposed it a year earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14229)|
| 3:57:14| We placed the property under contract in January of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| By mid-February, we were ready to submit our shopping center concept plan to MPC as the SC zone requires use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14238)|
| 3:57:25| That's when the Legacy Parks Foundation came along with their proposal on the neighboring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14245)|
| 3:57:30| By mid-February, that land was for sale and there was no contract on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14250)|
| 3:57:34| We had made an offer on the property, but the sellers turned it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14254)|
| 3:57:37| and instead went to contract with the Legacy Parks Foundation for less money than we had offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14257)|
| 3:57:42| We did not react as most would with the rush to the city county building to file a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14262)|
| 3:57:45| Instead, we greeted the Legacy Parks Foundation with open arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14265)|
| 3:57:48| We met with them on several of them and discussed their proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14268)|
| 3:57:52| and informed them of the access limitations they would face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14272)|
| 3:57:55| Mr. Fields, if you have one minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14275)|
| 3:58:05| Rezoning this property out from underneath us, as Commissioner Smith proposes, sends the following messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14285)|
| 3:58:11| Number one, the Knox County zoning ordinance, growth plan, general plan, and sector plan are not worth the paper they're written on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14291)|
| 3:58:17| if the Legacy Parks Foundation decides they want your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14297)|
| 3:58:20| Number two, the Legacy Parks Foundation is to be avoided by developers at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14300)|
| 3:58:25| Number three, the Knox County Commission will destroy the value of your property without compensation if it will gain public favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14305)|
| 3:58:31| as it relates to a popular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14311)|
| 3:58:33| And number four, capital investments in Knox County have a new and hidden source of risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14313)|
| 3:58:37| that outweighs the infrastructure you will build, the jobs you will create, the tax base you will generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14317)|
| 3:58:42| and even your own property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| We maintain that we did everything right at every turn in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14324)|
| 3:58:48| We complied with the zoning ordinance, growth plan, general plan, sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14328)|
| 3:58:51| The park project is not in compliance with any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14331)|
| 3:58:54| We didn't attack or avoid the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| We proactively tried to help them and spent a lot of time and money in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14336)|
| 3:58:59| Now the opposition believes that we should lose everything we've invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14339)|
| 3:59:02| and our property rights should somehow be conveyed to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14342)|
| 3:59:05| We commend the efforts of the Legacy Parks Foundation as evidence by our enormous effort to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| But the fact that they chose a commercial property on which to locate their property or park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14351)|
| 3:59:15| and they chose not to work with us should not result in the de facto condemnation of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14355)|
| 3:59:21| We ask that you do the right thing and deny this obvious attempt to extort our property away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14361)|
| 3:59:26| Stand up for your own ordinances and growth and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| Send a message that while parks are a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14369)|
| 3:59:31| and an important part of responsible growth, stealing land from them from developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14371)|
| 3:59:35| and landowners who are trying to cooperate is not going to be the policy of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14375)|
| 3:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| I'll let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14385)|
| 3:59:46| Then I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14386)|
| 3:59:53| Mr. Chairman, I'm John Buckingham at 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14393)|
| 3:59:58| And I represent property owners in the area of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14398)|
| 4:00:03| And Commissioner Smith's resolution is not a resolution to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14403)|
| 4:00:11| It is a resolution to ask MPC to review the zoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14411)|
| 4:00:18| So you're not here today being asked to rezone this property from anything to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14418)|
| 4:00:25| The point of this resolution is that when the MPC recently approved a use on review petition filed by these developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14425)|
| 4:00:37| to develop the shopping center property, it was appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14437)|
| 4:00:43| which consists of a number of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14443)|
| 4:00:47| And that Board of Zoning Appeals unanimously upheld the approval and denied the use on review petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14447)|
| 4:00:55| So the reason that prompted this to come before the commission to consider whether the zoning of this property is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14455)|
| 4:01:07| That's all this resolution is asking MPC to do is review the zoning of this property and not to rezone it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14467)|
| 4:01:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14476)|
| 4:01:17| Scott, anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| After the allegation, I'm sorry, Scott Frith, 4236 Williamson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14479)|
| 4:01:23| I'm on the Board of Directors for the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14483)|
| 4:01:26| I serve on our executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14486)|
| 4:01:28| I regret Carol Evans, our executive director, is out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14488)|
| 4:01:32| And with the allegations made by the developer, Mr. Silvis, I wish she were here to rebut each of those claims line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14492)|
| 4:01:39| Again, we strongly endorse Commissioner Smith's resolution as well as the recommendations of both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14499)|
| 4:01:46| We hope that this goes to MPC so that we can seek to address all these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14506)|
| 4:01:52| and some things that really concern me that he's brought up and thrown before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14512)|
| 4:01:59| After the MPC discussion, of course, we'll come back and talk about all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14519)|
| 4:02:04| I just want to bring up to date commissioners where we are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14524)|
| 4:02:08| It went for BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14528)|
| 4:02:09| Was it last month, two months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| When was it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| I believe it was September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14533)|
| 4:02:14| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14534)|
| 4:02:15| And it was unanimously turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14535)|
| 4:02:17| All we're doing, all I'm asking is let's send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14537)|
| 4:02:21| They're the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14541)|
| 4:02:22| Let MPC look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14542)|
| 4:02:24| Let them tell us what their opinion is on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14544)|
| 4:02:27| But we take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| And I didn't want to go into what Mr. Silvis was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14549)|
| 4:02:32| I disagree with it quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14552)|
| 4:02:34| But, you know, he needs to make that presentation to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14554)|
| 4:02:40| So I would ask that you support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14560)|
| 4:02:42| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14562)|
| 4:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14563)|
| 4:02:44| Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14564)|
| 4:02:50| If we send this back to you and then you're going to take a look at, I guess, everything that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14570)|
| 4:02:56| and make a recommendation to MPC, commission, and then that would then have to come back to us if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14576)|
| 4:03:04| something, if you're going to, if you're recommending a change of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14584)|
| 4:03:10| and then we would have to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14590)|
| 4:03:11| Is that how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14591)|
| 4:03:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14595)|
| 4:03:16| It's my understanding that this resolution actually would be a request to initiate a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14596)|
| 4:03:20| But I see that it's not worded that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14600)|
| 4:03:25| We're being requested to review the zoning as to whether it's appropriate, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14605)|
| 4:03:32| And we would use the context of the general plan, which currently calls for commercial activity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14612)|
| 4:03:39| and the parks plan to make that evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14619)|
| 4:03:46| We'll have to take a look at the exact wording in the resolution and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14626)|
| 4:03:54| But if MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14634)|
| 4:03:55| If we report back to you, the legislative body has the authority to initiate a general rezoning of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14635)|
| 4:04:03| The planning commission also has that, but has been very reluctant to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14643)|
| 4:04:08| particularly when it's not initiated by a group of citizens or a specific property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14648)|
| 4:04:20| If you do, I mean, if MPC does not act to change this in any way, it would not come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14660)|
| 4:04:26| It would only come back before us if MPC votes to do something different with this property, rezoning-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14666)|
| 4:04:35| From what I can see of the caption, we're simply being asked to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14675)|
| 4:04:40| and we'll lay out the options for you in some sort of a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14680)|
| 4:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| While we're on that subject, Mark, do we just need to take out the word review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14687)|
| 4:04:53| Take it out and just ask your opinion on rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14693)|
| 4:04:59| Does it need to be worded that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14699)|
| 4:05:00| And then you up or down it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14700)|
| 4:05:02| Is that not the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| If they're reviewing, are you asking them to rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14704)|
| 4:05:08| Yeah, if you're asking us to initiate a rezoning request, that's different than asking us to look at a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14708)|
| 4:05:15| as to whether, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14715)|
| 4:05:17| What about reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| Should we put the word reconsider in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14719)|
| 4:05:22| I would prefer that you actually spell out that you're initiating a request for a general rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14722)|
| 4:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14731)|
| 4:05:32| It's what Mr. Law Director, whatever it needs to be, so that they can work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14732)|
| 4:05:38| So MPC can work with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14738)|
| 4:05:40| Either way, I mean, what you're doing is asking the MPC to come back with a recommendation, and you can word it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14740)|
| 4:05:53| However, I think Mr. Donaldson said that as it's worded today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14753)|
| 4:05:57| they would come back with options that commission could take as opposed to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14757)|
| 4:06:03| a recommendation one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14763)|
| 4:06:07| The problem is that the general plan, the land use plan, is calling for commercial activity at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14767)|
| 4:06:13| not agricultural activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14773)|
| 4:06:16| So in order to rezone consistent with the general plan, we would have to amend the plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14776)|
| 4:06:22| The legislative body has the authority to initiate a request to amend the plan based on a new law that was passed this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14782)|
| 4:06:32| You know, bottom line, we will, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14792)|
| 4:06:34| do you think this track of land is suitable for a park, whatever the wording needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14794)|
| 4:06:41| Suitable for a park or suitable for commercial activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14801)|
| 4:06:44| The plan is calling for commercial activity on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14804)|
| 4:06:48| You know, commissioners, we've been working on this for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14808)|
| 4:06:50| The community has been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14810)|
| 4:06:52| Scott, how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14812)|
| 4:06:53| You all raised how much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| Five hundred seventy-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14815)|
| 4:06:58| Over half a million dollars and 900 school children for the adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14818)|
| 4:07:02| Does that count in the 300, the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14822)|
| 4:07:04| Yes, sir, from Jim and Kay Clayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14824)|
| 4:07:11| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| I'm a bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14833)|
| 4:07:14| Why don't we just ask directly for what we want, which is a park there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| Why second guess BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14838)|
| 4:07:19| Why do this sort of secondary maneuver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14839)|
| 4:07:23| Why not just simply go directly and try to make a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14843)|
| 4:07:26| Is there a zoning for a park specifically, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14846)|
| 4:07:31| Well, there's an open space zone district, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14851)|
| 4:07:36| whose primary use is park lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14856)|
| 4:07:44| You may run the risk of arguments about takings if we were to pursue such an activity with such a limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14864)|
| 4:07:52| list of permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14872)|
| 4:07:56| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14876)|
| 4:07:58| I represent the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14878)|
| 4:08:01| Which property is yours, 7315?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14881)|
| 4:08:07| If you all want the property, buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14887)|
| 4:08:11| Condemn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| Using the zoning ordinance to do the same thing is, I submit, illegal, arbitrary, and capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14894)|
| 4:08:21| and will result in the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14901)|
| 4:08:25| If you all want to buy this, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14905)|
| 4:08:28| Landowner will sell it to you if the price is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| But don't use the zoning ordinance to start condemning property in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14911)|
| 4:08:36| It's a dangerous precedent, and that's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14916)|
| 4:08:39| Well, we have every intention of buying the land from you, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14919)|
| 4:08:42| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14922)|
| 4:08:43| You're going to down zone it so you can get the value down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14923)|
| 4:08:47| If you want to make a fair offer, I've talked to some people who are interested in buying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14927)|
| 4:08:53| And if they'll pay for this property what they paid for the adjoining property, they can probably get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14933)|
| 4:09:00| But they're unwilling to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14940)|
| 4:09:02| They paid over $50,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14942)|
| 4:09:05| Most of yours is in the flood plain, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14945)|
| 4:09:07| Well, most of theirs is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| But anyway, if you want to do it, play by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14949)|
| 4:09:12| Play fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14952)|
| 4:09:13| Don't use the zoning ordinance to start condemning property in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14953)|
| 4:09:17| I think you're opening up a can of worms that is a very dangerous precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14957)|
| 4:09:23| Well, what's fair is send the property for appraisal and talk to them if you want to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14963)|
| 4:09:33| But don't use the zoning ordinance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14977)|
| 4:09:40| Yeah, that was, you know, as the conversation evolved, that fact, I guess, wasn't brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14980)|
| 4:09:47| I'd like to speak with the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14987)|
| 4:09:51| Mr. Short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14991)|
| 4:09:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14992)|
| 4:09:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14993)|
| 4:09:54| I'm only a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| No, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14996)|
| 4:09:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14997)|
| 4:09:58| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14998)|
| 4:09:59| Over in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=14999)|
| 4:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15000)|
| 4:10:01| So a big part of your dialogue was saying that we're not asking for you to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15001)|
| 4:10:07| We're just asking for you to send it back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15007)|
| 4:10:12| And then I'm starting to pick up on the fact that you all really are asking to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15012)|
| 4:10:17| I mean, I'm kind of a bottom line guy, and I take eminent domain very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15017)|
| 4:10:24| I take that whole property right, owner's rights very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15024)|
| 4:10:30| So if that's what you're trying to do, I would caution against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15030)|
| 4:10:36| So, but to ask you a direct question, you spent time talking about how that wasn't what you wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15036)|
| 4:10:44| You were not looking to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15044)|
| 4:10:46| You were only looking to send it back to MPC for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15046)|
| 4:10:52| My comment, Commissioner, was today we're not asking you to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15052)|
| 4:10:58| So the whole issue of what zone it should be is not before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15058)|
| 4:11:03| The issue of this resolution is to ask MPC to review the zoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15063)|
| 4:11:11| But, again, if that's really your intent, I think the intent needs to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15071)|
| 4:11:16| I mean, because if it comes back and that's really what you want after coming from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15076)|
| 4:11:21| I'm not going to look favorable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15081)|
| 4:11:24| If that's really what you want today, I think we need to do something today that says we like A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15084)|
| 4:11:31| And if it's a park, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| I mean, if it's in addition to the house park, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15093)|
| 4:11:37| You know, by that same time, this, you know, law your ease way of going about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15097)|
| 4:11:43| I strongly caution you if that's what, you know, you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15103)|
| 4:11:48| I strongly caution you against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15108)|
| 4:11:49| We don't know what MPC is going to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15109)|
| 4:11:52| MPC voted 7 to 6 to approve the use on review that was recently turned down by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15112)|
| 4:12:00| So we don't have any idea what MPC is going to recommend to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15120)|
| 4:12:05| What we're asking you to do is to let MPC take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15125)|
| 4:12:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15133)|
| 4:12:14| Arthur, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| And, Arthur, you know, nine times out, well, ten times out of ten until this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15136)|
| 4:12:23| I always vote with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15143)|
| 4:12:27| Here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15147)|
| 4:12:28| How long has this property owner owned this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15148)|
| 4:12:33| At what point, not when the deal was made, but at what point did you act on your option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15153)|
| 4:12:37| Because one of the things that I've heard is that when you brought this before BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15157)|
| 4:12:43| that you had an option on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| and that when you knew based on the BZA meeting that we were leaning toward this property becoming a part of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15165)|
| 4:12:57| and that at that point you went out and acted on your option to purchase the property, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15177)|
| 4:13:05| It's just like when the Park Foundation bought the land for their park two weeks prior to our favorable decision from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15185)|
| 4:13:12| I don't know why they did that, but they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15192)|
| 4:13:16| We purchased our property on the last day of our contract that we had on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15196)|
| 4:13:20| and that's why we purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15200)|
| 4:13:21| We couldn't extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| Was that after the BZA meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15203)|
| 4:13:31| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15211)|
| 4:13:32| It was right around that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15212)|
| 4:13:33| It was after the BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| But I don't think that makes any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| Well, I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15217)|
| 4:13:38| We had invested $125,000 in cash at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15218)|
| 4:13:41| I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15221)|
| 4:13:42| If, you know, in the old west, if you knew the railroad was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15222)|
| 4:13:45| so you went up and made claim to all the land the railroad was about to roll over, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15225)|
| 4:13:51| that was profiteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15231)|
| 4:13:52| And usually, like I said, I always vote with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15232)|
| 4:13:56| But what it looks like to me sitting up here is the guy knew that the interest was there for a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15236)|
| 4:14:02| so he acted on the option so he could turn a quick profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15242)|
| 4:14:06| And with that, I'm going to have to stick with the people of the 7th District on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15246)|
| 4:14:13| What he had done was spend over $125,000 in reliance upon the zoning on this property that it was zoned for a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15253)|
| 4:14:23| He spent that prior to even going to the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15263)|
| 4:14:27| And Mr. Seymour, he came to my office, and he sat down with me and his group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15267)|
| 4:14:31| and I told him, whoa, I mean, this is months and months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15271)|
| 4:14:35| I said, the community is not behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| We've wanted to park in that area for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15277)|
| 4:14:40| and I'd be real cautious about you spending any more money in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15280)|
| 4:14:44| You might want to hold a community meeting and see what the community thinks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15284)|
| 4:14:48| Never heard from them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15288)|
| 4:14:49| That meeting took place three days before the MPC meeting where the shopping center proposal was considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15289)|
| 4:14:56| and approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15296)|
| 4:14:58| That money had already been spent by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15298)|
| 4:15:01| If Knox County or Legacy Parks wants this property, they can pay actual cash value for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15301)|
| 4:15:09| And I have talked to some people not on their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15309)|
| 4:15:13| but I've talked to some people that are interested in acquiring this for a Knox County park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15313)|
| 4:15:17| And I said, pay fair compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15317)|
| 4:15:21| All Mr. Silvis wants is to come out even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| He doesn't make a profit at what he has proposed to sell the property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15323)|
| 4:15:30| But I'm not going to sit here and discuss property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15330)|
| 4:15:32| I've discussed that with several members of Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15332)|
| 4:15:35| I have also said if Legacy Parks is in the process of trying to stop development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15335)|
| 4:15:41| I'm working with a couple of other developers that are considering giving them some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15341)|
| 4:15:45| I've told them to wait until I see how this comes out because I think they're setting a bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15345)|
| 4:15:51| If they want to pay fair value for property, they're welcome to, just like any other governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15351)|
| 4:15:57| But they're not negotiating in good faith here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15357)|
| 4:16:01| And they're trying to use zoning to condemn property, which I think that's a good case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15361)|
| 4:16:11| I'd like to take that because the United States Supreme Court has finally gotten interested in property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15371)|
| 4:16:16| in this country, key low decision two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15376)|
| 4:16:20| And our Supreme Court, frankly, has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15380)|
| 4:16:24| I believe Scott was waiting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15384)|
| 4:16:27| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15387)|
| 4:16:28| I was hoping to talk about this at MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15388)|
| 4:16:30| But quite frankly, if we're calling a spade a spade, the community is being blackmailed by these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15390)|
| 4:16:35| So the gentleman that had the property listed with Toronto Real Estate contacted our fundraising committee the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15395)|
| 4:16:42| after this closing, which I believe was only last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15402)|
| 4:16:45| And they know that it was well after BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15405)|
| 4:16:48| And said that they were willing to accept a price between 500 and 600,000 after they had just closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15408)|
| 4:16:55| and only paid 300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| They say that they've delayed their ARAP permitting through TDEC, not from this past month, which it was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15417)|
| 4:17:04| Instead, they're delaying it to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15424)|
| 4:17:06| They have no intention, as they've indicated through their actions, of ever putting a shopping center here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15426)|
| 4:17:11| What they are indicating is that they're trying to blackmail this community to get more money out of our great donors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15431)|
| 4:17:17| and school kids in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| It infuriates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15439)|
| 4:17:20| I wish we had more of an opportunity to prepare to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15440)|
| 4:17:25| But, you know, by golly, let's do this process right and do what's right for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15445)|
| 4:17:31| I'd like to add just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15451)|
| 4:17:32| We had our land under contract since January 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15452)|
| 4:17:36| Our first contact with the sellers of this property was in October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15456)|
| 4:17:40| We heard nothing from the Legacy Parks Foundation until we were ready to submit our concept plan in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15460)|
| 4:17:45| And then we stopped and waited four months, redesigned everything to accommodate the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15465)|
| 4:17:50| We took 20 percent of our leaseable square footage out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| We added common areas with park furniture, sidewalk access points to the park, a greenway extension to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15472)|
| 4:17:57| a drive access to the park because they have no legal access to Norris Freeway from the archaic way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15477)|
| 4:18:02| that the TDOT stuff was set up back in the 30s when they built that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15482)|
| 4:18:06| We do intend to build a shopping center on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15486)|
| 4:18:10| We would love to execute our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15490)|
| 4:18:11| It's not mutually exclusive of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| We want to build a centerpiece to their park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15493)|
| 4:18:14| And we delayed our ARAP permit until February because we just filed our complaint to Chancellor Record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15494)|
| 4:18:18| to overturn the BZA decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15498)|
| 4:18:21| And we were told that it would take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15501)|
| 4:18:24| That's the only reason why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15504)|
| 4:18:30| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15510)|
| 4:18:32| I'd just like to echo what Commissioner McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15512)|
| 4:18:35| I think this is a way of getting MPC to look at this piece of property and reschedule it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15515)|
| 4:18:40| or rezone it for parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15520)|
| 4:18:43| And I think it's a backdoor way of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| I just think we need to take a long look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15525)|
| 4:18:49| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15531)|
| 4:18:52| What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15532)|
| 4:18:54| I mean, seriously, I've heard different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| What exactly is the wording of what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15536)|
| 4:19:00| That was my question to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15540)|
| 4:19:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15542)|
| 4:19:03| What was the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15543)|
| 4:19:04| What was going to happen at MPC and then what would possibly come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15544)|
| 4:19:06| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15546)|
| 4:19:07| And I think we need to have that clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15547)|
| 4:19:08| I'm confused still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15548)|
| 4:19:10| I think it's the way the caption reads to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15550)|
| 4:19:14| Are there going to be a review rezoning that property, both parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15554)|
| 4:19:20| It says 7315 and 7347.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15560)|
| 4:19:22| Is there two parcels to be reviewed or just one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15562)|
| 4:19:25| I think it's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15565)|
| 4:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15566)|
| 4:19:27| So we're reviewing both parcels and they're going to do a complete review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| And what are they coming back to us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15569)|
| 4:19:32| A recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15572)|
| 4:19:33| A recommendation on whether it should be rezoned or not or what possible zonings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15573)|
| 4:19:40| Mr. Donaldson, are you clear on what you're supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15580)|
| 4:19:44| List of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15584)|
| 4:19:47| Clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15587)|
| 4:19:50| We will review it and we will report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15590)|
| 4:19:53| We will give you a list of things that you can do and probably another list of things that you have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15593)|
| 4:20:00| in order to do the things that we will list that you can do, one of which may be amending the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15600)|
| 4:20:08| Can we do that or does MPC need to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15608)|
| 4:20:13| That would be a sector plan change, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| It would have to start MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15615)|
| 4:20:16| There's a new law that created a process by which the legislative body can initiate a plan amendment, public chapter 1150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15616)|
| 4:20:29| So we could invoke that for you to move forward if we need to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15629)|
| 4:20:37| But you have said that MPC has that same authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15637)|
| 4:20:40| They've been reluctant to do it because they would rather it be citizen initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15640)|
| 4:20:44| I would be fearful about the argument about takings if we were to initiate it, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15644)|
| 4:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15653)|
| 4:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15654)|
| 4:20:57| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15657)|
| 4:20:59| Mr. Silvas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15659)|
| 4:21:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15662)|
| 4:21:03| How much did you pay for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| That's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15668)|
| 4:21:09| I'm sorry, we paid $300,000 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15669)|
| 4:21:11| And now you're asking for twice that much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15671)|
| 4:21:13| No, we're not selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15673)|
| 4:21:14| Well, we told them that we would consider a fair offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15674)|
| 4:21:16| We have an appraisal for $600,000 and we have $125,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15676)|
| 4:21:21| If they paid us, what they offered us was 52% less per acre than they just paid for the neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15681)|
| 4:21:26| that has no usable frontage and no legal access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15686)|
| 4:21:30| At a kind heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15690)|
| 4:21:31| We're leaving 85% of the money that we stand to make on this development on the table if we sold it to them for $725,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15691)|
| 4:21:38| We view that as a considerable sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15698)|
| 4:21:40| They call it extortion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15700)|
| 4:21:47| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15707)|
| 4:21:53| That was going to be my question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15713)|
| 4:21:57| And I think I haven't comprehended yet what is your asking price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15717)|
| 4:22:04| Just the numbers, just the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15724)|
| 4:22:06| The last price we discussed when Commissioner Smith took me out in the hallway at the NPC meeting about 15 minutes before our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15726)|
| 4:22:12| item came up on the agenda and offered $300,000, basically it meant we would walk away and lose everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15732)|
| 4:22:17| And I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15737)|
| 4:22:18| Our counter was $725,000 based on a $600,000 appraisal, a $2,500 document that was prepared by Woodford and Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15738)|
| 4:22:25| and our $125,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15745)|
| 4:22:28| That puts it at about a 15% premium on a per acre basis to what they just paid next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15748)|
| 4:22:34| That's a significantly longer answer than I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15754)|
| 4:22:37| $725,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15757)|
| 4:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15759)|
| 4:22:40| So I would agree $300,000 offer is not a good offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15760)|
| 4:22:46| And I'd also say that $125,000 out-of-pocket, you can't do what you're doing and lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15766)|
| 4:22:54| So where did we end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15774)|
| 4:22:56| Four and a quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15776)|
| 4:22:58| Looking at an asking price of 700 and what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15778)|
| 4:23:01| Twenty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15781)|
| 4:23:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15782)|
| 4:23:05| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15785)|
| 4:23:06| Well, I about halfway got an answer from Arthur here a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15786)|
| 4:23:12| I went back and asked Buzz there, and I voted with Legacy Park on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15792)|
| 4:23:19| but I went back and asked Buzz, when you get into this down zoning, could the county be liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15799)|
| 4:23:27| And he said, I need to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15807)|
| 4:23:29| Well, Arthur gave a pretty good case there, but I'm still going to ask the law director, could we be liable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15809)|
| 4:23:36| There could be an action for inverse condemnation, which I believe is what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15816)|
| 4:23:42| The question becomes, you know, whether or not under the applicable ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15822)|
| 4:23:50| and regulations he used the phrase arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15830)|
| 4:23:58| And that's the legal standard, whether or not a body acts arbitrarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15838)|
| 4:24:04| and capriciously in not following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15844)|
| 4:24:09| Now, what this discussion originally started as a resolution on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15849)|
| 4:24:16| or not to refer it back to MPC for, as the resolution is worded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15856)|
| 4:24:23| review for rezoning in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15863)|
| 4:24:30| And if that's done, then this body has taken no action on this property tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15870)|
| 4:24:42| There's been discussion, and I think admittedly there is an end game here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15882)|
| 4:24:49| and that's what Mr. Seymour addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15889)|
| 4:24:52| Commissioner Harmon discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15892)|
| 4:24:56| But we're not there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15896)|
| 4:24:58| Mr. Donaldson mentioned the fact that the law, Tennessee law, allows for at least this body to initiate a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15898)|
| 4:25:09| in the sector plan, which allows for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15909)|
| 4:25:19| The question is, could this action subject the county to liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15919)|
| 4:25:25| And my answer is no, because this action is nothing more than sending it to MPC for further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15925)|
| 4:25:35| Well, that's what I thought it was to begin with when it said review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15935)|
| 4:25:37| but they're wanting to change it to ask the MPC to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15937)|
| 4:25:44| I'm like Commissioner Harmon there, which one are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15944)|
| 4:25:47| To rezone it or just to review it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15947)|
| 4:25:51| As I understand the motion that's on the floor, it is that I don't believe the resolution has been modified at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15951)|
| 4:26:03| And the resolution as worded is that the Knox County Commission hereby requests that MPC review for rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15963)|
| 4:26:13| in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15973)|
| 4:26:19| And then it lists the two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15979)|
| 4:26:22| So taking action on that resolution does not subject the county to liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15982)|
| 4:26:31| Would it subject MPC if they downzone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15991)|
| 4:26:35| Not if they do it according to the provisions of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=15995)|
| 4:26:41| which is what we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16001)|
| 4:26:46| Mr. Chairman, let me just jump in here and try to save us a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16006)|
| 4:26:50| We're going to do this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16010)|
| 4:26:53| We're going to meet with MPC and several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16013)|
| 4:26:56| And there's been a lot of people that have been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16016)|
| 4:26:58| Let's just postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16018)|
| 4:27:00| Let's try to get with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16020)|

| 4:27:05| Is that agreeable with you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16025)|
| 4:27:06| We can try to get with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16026)|

| 4:27:12| Yes, that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16032)|
| 4:27:13| You want to make a substitute motion to defer for 30 days and we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16033)|
| 4:27:18| Well, it won't be 30 days, it will be three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16038)|
| 4:27:21| Three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16041)|
| 4:27:22| And we'll try to get with them and try to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| Because, like I say, I want to do what's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16044)|
| 4:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16046)|
| 4:27:27| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16047)|

| 4:27:29| Do you have something, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| So does this mean that, thank you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16051)|
| 4:27:34| does this mean that MPC is not involved right now as far as the recommendation process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16054)|
| 4:27:41| It's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16061)|
| 4:27:42| But they're probably going to be at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| We will want their input at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16064)|
| 4:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16068)|
| 4:27:49| Somehow I think that they should be involved, the staff should be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16069)|
| 4:27:53| They're all part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16073)|
| 4:27:54| And without their involvement, we're kind of politicizing it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16074)|
| 4:28:00| I think what, Mr. Smith, yours is just to put this off for consideration at the next meeting of the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16080)|
| 4:28:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16087)|
| 4:28:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16088)|
| 4:28:09| And we'll try to get with, Mr. Seymour, we'll get you and your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16089)|
| 4:28:11| We'll see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16091)|

| 4:34:10| Are you requesting to withdraw both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16450)|
| 4:34:13| Withdraw all items that have a sector plan associated with them for rezoning and the sector plan changes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16453)|
| 4:34:21| And the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16461)|
| 4:34:22| And the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16462)|
| 4:34:24| Both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16464)|
| 4:34:26| Both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16466)|
| 4:34:27| The sector plan and the rezoning to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16467)|
| 4:34:30| And then they'll come back before us when MPC is ready to bring them back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16470)|
| 4:34:35| Our plan is to have these items that we acted on in July, August, and September on our November agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16475)|
| 4:34:47| so that we will then bring them forward to you in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16487)|
| 4:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16492)|
| 4:34:53| We're talking about Tennessee investments and Earl Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16493)|
| 4:34:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16497)|
| 4:34:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16498)|

| 4:35:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16500)|
| 4:35:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16501)|
| 4:35:03| Rob Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16503)|
| 4:35:07| This is a request of Rob Sanders for rezoning from PC plan commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16507)|
| 4:35:11| TO technology overlay to CB business and manufacturing and technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16511)|
| 4:35:16| The property is located northwest side of Lexington Drive, southwest of Cogdell Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16516)|

| 4:35:36| Request of H.S. Development Company, LLC, for rezoning from RA low-density residential to OA office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16536)|
| 4:35:43| The property is located southeast side, Sonny Lane, northeast of South Peters Road in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16543)|
| 4:35:50| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16550)|
| 4:35:52| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16552)|
| 4:35:55| Motion to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16555)|
| 4:35:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16558)|
| 4:35:59| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16559)|
| 4:36:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16560)|
| 4:36:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16561)|
| 4:36:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16562)|
| 4:36:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16563)|
| 4:36:05| Zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16565)|
| 4:36:08| This is an appeal by Charles Pilgrim of MPC denial of rezoning from PR plan residential to OB office medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16568)|
| 4:36:16| consistent with MPC's denial of the southwest county sector plan amendment to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16576)|
| 4:36:21| The property is located west side of Ebenezer Road, south of Blue Grass Road in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16581)|
| 4:36:28| Is this another one you need to deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16588)|
| 4:36:31| The same law comes into play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16591)|
| 4:36:34| In addition, because the planning commission acted to deny the plan amendment, in order to approve the zoning that Mr. Pilgrim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16594)|
| 4:36:46| has requested, the legislative body would have to initiate a plan amendment back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16606)|
| 4:36:56| So we're looking at like a three-month process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16616)|
| 4:36:59| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16619)|
| 4:37:01| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16621)|
| 4:37:03| If we initiated that process, it's three months, you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16623)|
| 4:37:08| You would need to initiate it by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16628)|
| 4:37:13| So that would come next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16633)|
| 4:37:16| It would then go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16636)|
| 4:37:18| MPC would make a recommendation or would act either to approve, deny, or make no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16638)|
| 4:37:25| And then it would come back to the county commission, whereupon you could act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16645)|
| 4:37:31| But the applicant here would like a resolution, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16651)|
| 4:37:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16657)|
| 4:37:38| But otherwise, he has to just accept the denial and go forward with whatever other plans he might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16658)|
| 4:37:43| Currently, we have a plan, land use plan, that calls for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16663)|
| 4:37:50| He's asking for an office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16670)|
| 4:37:52| You have to or you can only amend the zoning ordinance in consistency with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16672)|
| 4:38:01| So in order to rezone to office, you need to amend the plan to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16681)|
| 4:38:07| You can initiate that request, but to get it back, then it will take three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16687)|
| 4:38:15| I would like for Mr. Pilgrim to have just a moment to address this body, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16695)|
| 4:38:22| I'm Charles Pilgrim, 1605 Botsford Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16702)|
| 4:38:26| It is my understanding that the sector plan amendment has not been officially denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16706)|
| 4:38:34| It's only recommended for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16714)|
| 4:38:36| It's going to be reheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16716)|
| 4:38:37| Did I misunderstand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16717)|
| 4:38:39| The planning commission has the authority to adopt a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16719)|
| 4:38:43| The planning commission acted on your request and denied the request to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16723)|
| 4:38:49| So the existing plan stayed in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16729)|
| 4:38:54| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16734)|
| 4:38:55| But was that denial, is that valid because of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16735)|
| 4:38:59| Because of the 30-day public notice, we will be reconsidering that plan amendment in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16739)|
| 4:39:08| And you will have the opportunity to bring it up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16748)|
| 4:39:12| So is it officially denied now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16752)|
| 4:39:15| I'm wondering, am I denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| Well, it's officially low-density residential because nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16757)|
| 4:39:22| My request is my request to change it denied at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16762)|
| 4:39:27| I mean, it's a vote by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16767)|
| 4:39:29| Is it valid from the September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16769)|
| 4:39:33| No, the vote was not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16773)|
| 4:39:34| That's why we're re-advertising everything and hearing them again on November with the proper public notice time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16774)|
| 4:39:41| So it has not been denied by the planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16781)|
| 4:39:44| It's not denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16784)|
| 4:39:45| Just the staff has recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16788)|
| 4:39:49| So it's going to be reheard as a new matter, new item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16789)|
| 4:39:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16793)|
| 4:39:54| There will be a public hearing at our November 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16794)|
| 4:39:58| So I'm approaching the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16798)|
| 4:39:59| I don't have a denial at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16799)|
| 4:40:01| No, but the plan currently is for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16801)|
| 4:40:05| Until that's amended, a zoning to OA would be inconsistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16805)|
| 4:40:12| So if it is denied next month, am I completely out of luck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16812)|
| 4:40:17| I cannot go back to the county commission anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16817)|
| 4:40:20| Then, as I was saying, the county commission can initiate a plan amendment in writing by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16820)|
| 4:40:31| And then the planning commission would act upon it, either to approve, deny, or make no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16831)|
| 4:40:37| Then it would come back to the legislative body, and they could act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16837)|
| 4:40:42| But if I'm denied for the plan sector amendment, then I can't appeal it to the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16842)|
| 4:40:48| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16848)|
| 4:40:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16849)|
| 4:40:50| I can or cannot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16850)|
| 4:40:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16851)|
| 4:40:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16852)|
| 4:40:53| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16853)|
| 4:40:54| It's like you did today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16854)|
| 4:40:55| I understood that the plan sector amendment could not be appealed when I went to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16855)|
| 4:41:00| But it officially has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16860)|
| 4:41:01| That's what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16861)|
| 4:41:02| I hear Mark Donaldson saying is that since they acted prior to what they're officially supposed to have allowed, 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16862)|
| 4:41:10| I guess anything that they did the first time around is not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16870)|
| 4:41:15| Is that correct, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16875)|
| 4:41:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16876)|
| 4:41:17| So the plan currently is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16877)|
| 4:41:20| So, really, there's been officially no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16880)|
| 4:41:23| And now you're going to hear it in November 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16883)|
| 4:41:29| And the only way that the legislative body can overrule the planning commission's adoption of a plan amendment is to initiate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16889)|
| 4:41:39| in writing by voting in the majority and then allow the planning commission to react to that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16899)|
| 4:41:46| and then bring it back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16906)|
| 4:41:50| Well, I guess my question then is, do we need to try to initiate that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16910)|
| 4:41:56| And it may not pass, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16916)|
| 4:41:59| Or do I need to wait until this process plays itself out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16919)|
| 4:42:03| Well, it's not been denied yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16923)|
| 4:42:04| It hasn't been denied yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| We'll know that November 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16926)|
| 4:42:08| But you should be prepared to have something on the agenda at your next meeting to initiate a process if you want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16928)|
| 4:42:18| Well, can the county commission hear the rezoning request since they're not allowed to hear a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16938)|
| 4:42:25| Can they hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16945)|
| 4:42:26| If they did approve it, could it be pending the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16946)|
| 4:42:30| We can't deal with sector plans at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16950)|
| 4:42:34| They're not allowed to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081027?start=16954)|
