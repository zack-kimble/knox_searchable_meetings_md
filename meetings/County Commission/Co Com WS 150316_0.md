| 0:07:57| I can't say enough about what this organization does in the years that it's been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| And those of you who have computers and iPads with you, if you want to go to the Tennessee Economic Council on Women homepage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=485)|
| 0:08:15| Actually, I'm going to vote to move this without recommendation, and we can do the bulk of our discussion next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=495)|
| 0:08:26| because I would like to give you all an opportunity to go explore their website and see what all they do provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| not just to the women of Tennessee, but to all citizens of Tennessee, the research that they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| the reports that they've put out, the resources they have, including their new site that they've put up about their online workforce tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=518)|
| 0:08:48| which is just absolutely incredible, and it's useful to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| So this is a great organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| It takes the least amount of funding of any group like this that the state supports to the tune of, I think, $300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=537)|
| 0:09:08| And so the return on investment that the citizens get for the state of Tennessee is just outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| So I'm not sure what happened in that Senate committee, but it needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| And I think that the majority of the population of Knox County, being women, would appreciate us sending that message to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=563)|
| 0:09:32| So that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Your motion is changed to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Yeah, let's just send it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Item 29 is a motion and vote of the commission to mandate that the chair call a special session of the commission on April 20, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| at 4 p.m. for the purpose of filling the vacancy in the position of Knox County Judicial Magistrate, seat D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| Before we vote on that, three commissioners will be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| And so would you rather come for a special session or the week before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=607)|
| 0:10:18| or would you rather put it into the commission meeting and have the judges use substitutes another week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=618)|
| 0:10:27| What would the judges prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| The judges would prefer us to, as soon as the resignation is over, to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| But they can use substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| It's just difficult for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I mean, it can be cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| So I can check the dates and look at the 13th for a 4.30 or 5 o'clock meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| and then we can vote on it or we can do it the two weeks after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Commissioner Oldenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I mean, I prefer the week earlier, but, I mean, that's the 13th special call just for that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=650)|
| 0:11:00| Do we have to have a special call meeting for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Well, they want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| We can't make it part of a regular commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Well, you can, but there will be a vacancy for three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| and they would prefer to get it filled prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| It's a preference of the judges, not a have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| That's why I said I'd rather do it on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| That way we can go ahead and get this resignation set for the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| Can I make a motion to change the resolution to allow the chair to set a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| and not put the date in there until we get the date set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| I would second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Commissioner Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Does anybody have any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Any preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Is that a conflict on you, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Could we not do this at our regular meeting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| No, because the vacancy won't be there until April 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Anybody have a conflict on the 13th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| There's a motion to have the chair call a special session without a date for the fulfilling of the vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| We're going to go ahead and do the ordinance that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| This is Ordinance O-15-3-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| It is amending Knotts County Code, Chapter 12, Article 2, entitled Peddlers and Solicitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| to amend Section 12-29, License Procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| to give the county clerk the authority to not issue a license to an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| if there are any outstanding warrants against the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| or if the applicant has been convicted of a crime or moral turpitude within the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| to revise portions of the procedure for obtaining a license in Section 12-29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| and to amend Section 12-33 to authorize the county clerk to suspend or revoke a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| if it is discovered that there is an outstanding warrant against a license holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| or a license holder has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within the past ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| This amends Ordinance O-97-5-101, adopted July 28, 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| and Ordinance O-12-10-101, adopted November 19, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| We have a motion to approve and a second. Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| I'm just trying to understand where do we get the number ten years from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| That's kind of standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| That's what we do with the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Is there a state law, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Is that kind of a clearing point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| The basis of this was established in several different statutes that do limit activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| One of them was the beer board, which is the moral turpitude clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| The others were some of the different types of violations that were enumerated specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| and some of those were related to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| So we just used the state basis of ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| There's not a golden number to that, but that's what is usually like on, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| the beer ordinances to get a license to be there is ten-year moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| And so that's basically where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Well, you know, I just have trouble with that number, and I understand for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| I mean, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| I mean, you know, we can sell to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| We can do damage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| You know, this isn't anywhere near the amount of risk associated with selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| And, you know, we have to, at some point, reintroduce those folks who served their term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| who were doing well, back into society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| You know, that's why I applaud the Catrans, even though the new Sentinel tried to blast them for hiring this gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| you know, who had been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| But he served his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| He came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| He worked his way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| At some point, if we take away all the hurdles, I mean, if we take away all the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| and just keep putting hurdles and hurdles, ten years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Ten years could be a lifetime for someone, you know, who's had an issue or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| And for, you know, a peddler's and solicitor's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Again, we're not talking about beer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| We're not talking about something that could, you know, damage children or, you know, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| So I would like to have that number re-evaluated, I guess I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| I don't want to throw one out there willy-nilly, but I'd like to have it re-evaluated if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Commissioner Brault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Yeah, I agree with Sam on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| If someone has served their time or paid their debt or whatever, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| especially in this context, like Sam said, you know, beer board is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| But this is a low-risk, seems to be a low-risk situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| And also, I think I've asked a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| from probably the law director to almost everybody on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| no one's ever been able to define for me exactly what a crime of moral turpitude is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| So I guess it's one of those things that you know it when you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| But I have a problem with the 10 years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| So I can't support this at 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I just don't want us to, I'm going to talk on the other side of that just very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| not necessarily opposing it, but just to give you another thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| I don't want us to take too lightly about giving people a license to go door to door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| without thinking about a lot of our senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| And from personal example of what I've seen with some of my relatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| that I think some of these people that go into our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| if we don't make sure that they are doing what they say they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| and not casing our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| we just need to make sure that we are being diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| and making sure that these people are who they say they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I would even be willing to entertain something to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| crimes of violent nature, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| But, you know, we're talking, that's not what, you know, this is more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| You could label it as an FBI top one crime instead of a moral turpitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| and that defines what top one crimes are and top two crimes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| So we'll look into that for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1089)|

| 0:19:07| I thought that was for the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| They had asked me to move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I'm not sure if they're here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1152)|

| 0:19:16| They may be here for the regular called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1156)|

| 0:19:20| Yeah, they're going to be here for the regular called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Because they had sent an e-mail to move it up to the front and I thought it was for that day and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1163)|

| 0:19:28| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| They might have been held up in security with a big crowd coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| My wife, if you all could text her right now and tell her that I really am at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| I figured she'd be listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1180)|

| 0:20:22| 35 is discussion regarding the request for proposal for lobbying services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Hugh, do you mind to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| I'll let Hugh explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| He's done some work on that since the last meeting, and we'll entertain some discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Go ahead, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I have draft copies of an RFP that we put together for lobbying services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| We looked at several entities across the country who acquire lobbying services on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| and we tried to take the best of breeds and put together a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| I have that document available to pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I don't know what the wishes of the commission is as far as moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I would assume that there would be a person that the commission would like to appoint as a lead for this to work with my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| but that's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| My thought was that I would work with Hugh, and we would all look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| I'd pass out the draft proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I will work with Hugh and his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| and if we just choose to go forward with the RFP, you guys can take a week to look over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| and we'll make a decision if we want to send out the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| If that's an objection to that, Commissioner Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| No, that doesn't need an action on our part, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Do you have something you want to pass out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Do you want me to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| The sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1308)|
| 0:22:00| I spent a little bit of time last week in Nashville with TCCA and some of our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1320)|
| 0:22:09| and there's quite a few bills that are touching county governments, local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| where the state would like to, some things they would like to do in regard to hall income tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| some commission issues on who can run for commission and who can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| So there's a lot to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| The BEP discussion was heavy down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| As a matter of fact, Metro Nashville has decided to allow the, to hold off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| and allow the new commissioner of education to begin some discussion on a new formulation for BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| So there's a lot going on right now that I think would lend to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Commissioner Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah, just to kind of chime in, I mean, this session, again, it's party independent from my standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1369)|
| 0:22:58| but there's just a lot of things that they're looking at that are affecting local government in a major, major way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1378)|
| 0:23:07| So, really, I'm more resolved now that we need someone in Nashville representing our interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| because there's so many of them, and there's so, you know, some of them are, you know, pet peeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| personal pet peeves that are getting tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| And others, you know, could do major damage, and others can benefit us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| So I just, yeah, in the last month, to me, it's kind of heartened my stance on the fact that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1406)|
| 0:23:35| however you and Hugh put it together, but I think we're going to need someone or some entity in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1415)|
| 0:23:45| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| In that regard, if we have somebody down there, comes up like that, when you look at the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| how long it takes them to get back to us and for us to have a meeting and to act, is it not too late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| I think they can see some of the writing on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| There would be times where we'd have to utilize the forum and email and have a discussion on forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| but I think it would just be being aware of the email and the forum, that you can use the forum for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| I mean, that's something that we could utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| But it's, you know, once they drop the bills and the captions and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| there were 43 new things that we looked at last Tuesday that could affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| or could not affect county highways and haul income tax and introduction of some bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And so we voted as an association to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| But, you know, there was probably 52 in the previous meeting that I went to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So there's probably 90 bills that the TCCA is just looking at just on county governments alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| So there's a lot in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Also, just as an example, two email blasts that came out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| about things that are being voted on in committee this very week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| One of them, which I think is of great importance to us here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| will be voted on tomorrow and then again on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And if we had had a lobbyist in place, we would have known about it before, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| this afternoon when we got the email blast saying, hey, this is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| And we were just fortunate that we happened to be meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| and we could put these on the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| But a lobbyist would have let us know about these before today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| when we would have hopefully had some time to discuss them a little more in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| and take action if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| So we've got that set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Is there any other discussion in regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| Item 36, discussion regarding Purple Cities Alliance Dementia Aware Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| They're going to be here next Monday and just do like a little three-minute presentation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| We'll move them behind the housing up to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Is there a motion to approve line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1589)|

| 0:26:31| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1591)|

| 0:26:38| Discussion regarding TBI rape kits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| This is one of the things I was talking about that we got in an e-mail blast today about urgent action needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| and it came from the Women's Political Collaborative Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| And it's about Senate Bill 981 and House Bill 1239,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| which creates protocol for the collection of sexual assault evidence kits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| and requires submission of certain kits to police and then the TBI for forensic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| and directs the Domestic Violence Coordinating Council to draft model policy for sexual assault evidence collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| and maintenance for adoption by law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| And I was surprised that there's not already a policy around the state, a matching policy around the state for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| I tried to call J.J. earlier and wasn't able to reach him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| But, Brad, you might be able to give us a little more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| My understanding is that there's already a tremendous backlog of cases that are evidence kits that have not been processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| There were, but there's tremendous progress made on that backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| This is about a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| This is just setting up a statewide policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| Yeah, and I think a statewide policy makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I've since also reached out today to the Sexual Assault Crisis Center but haven't had an opportunity to hear back from them yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| because, as I said, this just came in this afternoon by email blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| But it's something that's going to be voted on this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So if that's something that any of you feel as strongly about as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| I would appreciate you contacting the members of the House Criminal Justice Committee and asking them to vote yes on this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| And this email came to the commission office, so Jolie forwarded it to every commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| So every commissioner has a copy of this with the information and who to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So I would just ask you to please take a look at that and contact members of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Discussion regarding Lexi Park property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Mr. Chair, at French Park, which is where the Pinkston Library is, they have some nice walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1734)|
| 0:29:03| And between there and the South Doyle High School campus, there was a little strip of land that wasn't connected to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1743)|
| 0:29:16| But due to the generosity of the Wood family, they donated that little strip of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| and actually part of it is in a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| They couldn't build on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| But they have donated that little strip of land to Legacy Parks, who in turn is now wants to give it to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| Doug Battelle is already on board with it with Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| So it's a matter of talking to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| We need to get the deed things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| And that will probably be on the agenda for next month in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| It will take a little time to get that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Discussion regarding the fire committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| The fire protection committee was to have met today, and that meeting did not occur due to several members being on spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1808)|
| 0:30:18| Not that the members were on spring break, but that their children were, so they were out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| The next meeting of the fire study working group will be on the 30th in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| One of the things that did occur today, though, and you will also see it in your e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Kevin Lauer, CTAS person, has sent us a comparative county fire protection summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1839)|
| 0:30:51| which goes into some detail at describing how Knox County would compare to other counties in the state of Tennessee related to fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1851)|
| 0:31:07| This report may have only come to members of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| and I will make sure that everyone has a copy of it because on the 30th it will be presented more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| I know Charlie Bussler has a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Correct, Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Commissioner Thomas, do you have a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| Do you remember seeing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I'm trying to figure out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I have it with me, but I remember seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| So we will get this then re-sent so everyone of commission can see what's occurring in other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| and let me say it's from across the state, like saying Bradley or Hamilton, Rutherford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| but then also Sevier County and then back to the other end of the state, Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| So this is nothing more than a presentation of facts and figures by CTAS, a report to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| saying what other counties are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| It's not recommendation to the specifics of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| It's nothing more than a report, and he brought a copy of it and was here earlier at like 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| I mean, did we start at 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| We started at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| He may have been through here at 4 o'clock, and I have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I have a hard copy of it here in front of me if you'd like to see it this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Unless there are other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| The next item is Amy's discussion on MPC, the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| This was another email blast that we got today from the TCSA executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| about a bill that's scheduled for consideration in committee this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| and it's about zoning, and according to the executive director of the TCSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| it says this would essentially make comprehensive zoning meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| The bill is by Senator Nicely and Representative Daniel, and under this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| zoning of any parcel of private property can only take effect with the consent of the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| which would essentially make comprehensive zoning meaningless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| because you can only restrict the use of property with the agreement of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| And while there are some citizens who want no restriction on the private use of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| there are others who rely on zoning to preserve the value and enjoyment of their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| And, of course, we're all big property owner rights people here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| But zoning, we all know, is very important for a lot of reasons in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and David Hill, I think, is here from MPC, who may be able to answer any questions that anyone may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| But this is going to come up for a vote in Senate State and Local Government Committee tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2046)|
| 0:34:16| and then a hearing in Local Government Subcommittee on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| And I think it would be a good idea for us to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| and see if this is something that we want to weigh in on or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| Actually, the TCSA is opposed to it and is asking us to contact the members of these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| What's the Senate bill number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| The Senate bill number is 549.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| Yeah, HB 775.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And it turns out that one of the members of the Senate committee is our own Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2091)|
| 0:35:00| So it wouldn't hurt to give him a call or any of the rest of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| So it's just something I think we should be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| As Brad mentioned, there's a lot of bills that have been dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| and they're moving really quickly through committee, and we are getting these email blasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| And a lot of these I think that the commission needs to weigh in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| because they can have a tremendous impact here on us in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| David, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I prepared a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Dave Hill with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| I prepared a very quick handout after receiving notification you were going to talk about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| The actual language of the House bill is located on page three of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| And then existing Tennessee Code sections that would be affected are on pages four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| So when they refer to section 137105, that is the one that affects the county's zoning powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2150)|
| 0:35:58| 137204 affects cities and municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| So it covers both cities and counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| Everything that's been said, I mean, it's actually fairly simple language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Most of the time you receive applications from petitioners who are requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| and consent to a change in their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| One thing that comes to mind for me is you have instances where you have an applicant asking for something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2180)|
| 0:36:30| four dwelling units per acre, and the MPC recommendation is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Sometimes you're negotiating during the meeting and, you know, you'll take a vote on 3.4, 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| And I think at the end of that, if this were to be adopted, you'd have to ask the owner, do you consent to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2204)|
| 0:36:54| So that's kind of the change in terms of when there's active changes being sought to a zoning for a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| On the other side of it is the idea of actually rezoning, which is an authority of this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| without the property owner's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I don't think you use that power very often, but that would be the power that would be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| So, and just in terms, I actually, I knew you had talking about a lobbyist on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2238)|
| 0:37:27| One of the things that I think MPC has to do is we probably need a conduit and proper instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| so that we let you know of items of planning importance that may affect either cities or counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| For example, I know that the American Planning Association, Tennessee Chapter, is monitoring 23 bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| and some of those affect annexation powers, some of them zoning powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| some of them building inspections and code enforcement authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| We'd be happy to share that with you and develop some regular type of communication if that's the desire of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Just a quick question to help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| When you say you would have to ask the property owner, would that be before the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| So if we walked in the room and the zoning partner was represented by legal counsel and the person isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| theoretically is not here, and we, they think it's three, and we take it down to 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| We couldn't vote on that until he got consent from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Well, that's my question, is procedurally how would you actually effectuate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I think that there would have to be a confirmation of the vote acceptable by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and then you would have to get confirmation from the property owner that that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| But this in no way would take away from the county's ability to develop sector plans and do planning, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| I think it would change some of the thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| In some sector plans there are, particularly in areas of the city where you have areas that were zoned as far back as the 40s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2346)|
| 0:39:18| and 50s, there are some areas that actually are subject to recommendations for what are called general rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| And it's clear there was, as a matter of fact, there was an NSCIP general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| This may be the reason that the legislation was introduced in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| There was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Bourgeois that objected to his rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| I don't know if that's the case or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| but there are places where the community recognizes that longstanding zoning on undeveloped property is really not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2387)|
| 0:39:57| So city council has, on occasion, gone back and conducted these general rezonings and, in a sense, downzoned them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2397)|
| 0:40:07| but not after a very rigorous public involvement program and hearing from the property owners themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| I do not know of any such instances where a county commission has engaged in a general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| One of the things that the TCSA executive director points out in his e-mail is a possible scenario under this would be that many homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2426)|
| 0:40:39| across the state have purchased property with an expectation that they are living in an area that will only be used for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| But under this bill, someone who purchases undeveloped land in that residential zone could refuse to consent to that limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| and use the property for commercial or industrial purposes, having a detrimental impact on the surrounding residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| So basically in the issue of, I think, when we're talking about negotiating about how many units per acre or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2463)|
| 0:41:13| ultimately the decision would be the property owners, not the commissions or the NPCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| Well, it's still going to have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Any change is going to have to be approved with this body, whether it's a zoning change, a sector plan change, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| But that scares me when I read that last sentence, the way that it's written there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| without any further discussion of what could be done or should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2497)|
| 0:41:47| Basically saying, like you said, they can use it for whatever they want, and that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And thank you, David, for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| This is terrific, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| But isn't all land in Knox County already assigned to zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| And at a time when annexation was occurring more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| there was a changeover whenever property was annexed from county zoning to the most comparable zoning category for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2531)|
| 0:42:22| I think the question raised in terms of whether a property owner consents to their existing property designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| or the existing zoning category, whether that is, I guess, for lack of a better term, grandfathered, is a question for interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| If anybody could say, I just don't accept the zoning my property has, it would really create mass chaos and confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| Could that also not mean that we as a commission and MPC could just start zoning people's property however we felt it should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2571)|
| 0:43:02| If the widest interpretation available, which basically means people can object to whatever zoning they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2582)|
| 0:43:12| and going back to your original question about sector planning, I would say, why would we even conduct such an exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| Because it would really go back to free enterprise and individual property decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| I guess the real question is, why did this come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| What happened that two legislators have chosen to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| And what type of municipalities does it really affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Yeah, Nicely is a local guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Nicely is a Jefferson County, and the other guy is local. The rep is local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| So one of the things I think we need to decide is individually do we want to contact the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| I think we should contact the members of these committees and ask them to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| But do we also want to ask Brad to go out to Nashville tomorrow and Wednesday and be there in person and speak against them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2642)|
| 0:44:16| I will contact Commissioner Dr. Briggs and see what he feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I mean, it may die in committee tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Well, I'm hoping that it does die in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| That's what I would like to see happen, and apparently that's what the TCSA would like to see happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| They feel that this would be detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| I'm just trying to send Brad out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| I think it would be wise if each of us sent an email to the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| especially Dr. Briggs, at least to hold off on it until we can do a little research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| And I'll get with TCSA and see if Mr. Curtis can go lobby for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Can the chairman draft that letter and we just all sign it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| I can try to get that done tonight, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| I mean, it would be easier if you just sent an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Because by the time, Jolie won't be here to send it out and signature it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| So why don't you guys just send an email out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| We'd have to vote on that too, wouldn't we, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| If you're doing it as a collective body, if you're doing it as individual citizens or commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| you can do anything you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Let's just do it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| It makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Could I ask a question here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Going back to what you're saying, does that affect current zoning or does that just wipe out zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| What I heard you saying is if an individual doesn't like his zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| now he can come to you and say, I don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| But does it go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| Or does it start now from this point on what your land is zoned at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| The individual has the right to say, yes, I want to keep it, or no, I want to change it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And then we have to decide on how it's to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| Commissioner Bussler, when I look at it and interpret it as a planning professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| I don't quite consider the current zoning to be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| and effective until such time as it is changed by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| However, this e-mail from the Executive Director, David Connor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| where he says someone who purchases undeveloped land in that residential zone could refuse to consent to that limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2793)|
| 0:46:43| simply asks a question that I guess is there an ambiguity that needs to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| I don't read it that way when I read the proposed legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| but it may be a question that has to be researched and get a better solid grasp of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| Well, read the rest of the sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| I mean, it's a continuation, so we would assume if it goes through, they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| Well, it's an e-mail from the Executive Director of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I don't know how attorneys or court tests or the law director may want to chime in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| I really don't know how it would be eventually interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| So how do we interpret it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Mr. Chairman, looking at spots for the bill being centered nicely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| I would view this to be something that he's presenting to keep agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| zoned agricultural land being zoned industrial by a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| so that a rail yard could be built inside his represented territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| He needs to make that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| You're probably right, but there may be some unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| The thing, though, that we do read is that it says a future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| Let me find this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Any zoning amendment has to be approved by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| And the way we look at zoning amendments, they are always offered by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| We are not in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| We have no process here in Knox County where we, the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| go to rezone some piece of property without the owner or his agent being the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| So I'm merely trying to say what might be the intent of Senator Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| And now we have the huge question in front of us is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| You may not have exercised the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| but I do believe this legislative body has the power to initiate a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| or application for a rezoning without the consent of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| I just don't know of any instances where that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I think if he wants to fix something in Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| he needs to either run for commission or have that bill drilled up for Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| I'll email Mr. Curtis in Nashville to see if he gets a feeling on that bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| but I would encourage you to email that board, that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| I do have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I'm having my usual, which I haven't been able to have recently because of travel health and inclement weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| but my usual meeting at the time warp, meeting between the meetings will be Friday at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| Mike Hammond is going to be there to talk about changes that he's making in the Knox County criminal court clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3008)|
| 0:50:19| which I think he's doing a terrific job there, making lots of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| Things are happening at a pretty rapid pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| He's got some great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| In fact, there's something that they're working on implementing that I think I'm going to end up submitting to NACO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| for a nationwide innovation award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| So he's going to be there discussing some things that he's doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| and also about the $2.5 million in the account that was found, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| And we're also going to have somebody there from Helen Ross McNabb talking about their interchange program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| where they work with youth and families in the juvenile justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| So it should be a good discussion on justice topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| And, of course, as always, the first cup of coffee is on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| but you have to bring your own quarters for the vintage pinball and video games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| Dr. Thomas, you had an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Two things I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| First of all, don't forget tomorrow from five to seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Ed and I are putting together a night out in Knox County in Powell at the Halftime Pizza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| and we'd like all of you all to come by if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| We'd love to see you, and any elected officials or public, they're all welcome to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Ed and I will buy pizza until our money runs out, which will be pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Another thing I want to bring up is something occurred here in Knox County a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| that they tried to slip it by us without commission knowing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| but I just want to put them on notice that you're not going to be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| that this body will find out, but Gerald Witt of the New Sentinel got married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| And he tried to slip it by us, so we want to make sure that we congratulate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3129)|
| 0:52:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| I'd like to point out for the benefit of the finance director that the money wasn't found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| It was unallocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| Professor Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I think the reason I was addressed as Professor Wright is because as an unofficial member of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3163)|
| 0:52:55| I have been asked by the Board of Education for our consideration of the reappointing members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| to what was called the Joint Board of Education-County Commission workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| which had been meeting once a month, four members of the Board of Education, four members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| I was asked at their last scheduled meeting to get consideration for that committee being reconstituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3199)|
| 0:53:32| and open the floor for your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Who's on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Sam, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| You were on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| My camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| My camera's on one that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| So Sam, Dave, Amy, is there anybody else that would want to replace my camera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| No, no, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| I want to make sure I have these sunshine laws straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| If somebody is on either of these committees, we cannot talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| You can have discussion, you can talk to them, but you can't discuss items that could come on either agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3244)|
| 0:54:13| if they're on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| So if your school board member's on that committee, you can't talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| But what if my school board member's not on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Unless you sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| But another member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| As it stood from last year, and we spent a third of the year speaking on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| if an item could come before that committee, then you could not discuss it with any of those members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3273)|
| 0:54:45| That's the way we settled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| But, again, this committee, I had the first district school board member was on the committee with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| Again, I took a very strict interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| So we were going to talk about X number of things, and we laid that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| and those things in that box we could not discuss, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| And that was with her or any of the other members or Amy or Dave or Mike Hammett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| You know, we've got another situation with the radio board where the comment was made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| sometimes we strain it enough to swallow a camel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| If you can't talk to your peers about a specific subject, we have taken Fensler's ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3330)|
| 0:55:42| and I think, in my opinion, added something in there that is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| Now, it's been said time and time again, the law director, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| you can discuss anything you cannot deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| It depends on which body you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| And the problem with this issue is you have a blended body of which commission is under a court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| and the school board is under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| And you all cannot talk about, according to the Fensler ruling, anything that may possibly come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| So those commissioners on that board cannot talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| Commissioner McKenzie got it pretty well right when he described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| If it's anything that's going to come before that body, those members of that board cannot discuss it among each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| If it is not going to come before that board, then he can discuss anything that's not going to come before that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| as any of you could with any other school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| And I want to interject this because the topic, I don't know where you're headed with the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| but when this particular body was constituted, the resolution gave the chairman the option to do it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3415)|
| 0:57:05| But if you're going to reconstitute this board, if that's where you're headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| it has to be done by resolution this time because the past resolution requires it to be done by resolution if it's continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| So it's not something that can be just appointed or decided tonight in the sense it can be added as a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| you all can deal with it, but I mean it has to be a resolution and the members have to be appointed by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| based upon the way their last resolution was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We'll get one for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Yeah, so we can add that Monday and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| Because I thought it was a great process, it was a great group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and I was disappointed when it was dissolved and we weren't continuing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| So I'd love to see it continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| We can also try to set up a budget dinner with all of them, get together like we did at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Yes, that's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| If we limit this committee to four people on each board, that excludes some people that really want to have some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| Can we not formally form committees and just have meetings that we disclose where everybody gets together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| We can, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| But that one-on-one conversation or that four-on-four conversation was pretty productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| We can do both, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Yeah, it's real hard to talk 20 folks in a room, and that's really what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| People will have opinions, and it's hard to get those opinions on the table before the issue moves on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| So I do think that that smaller group, anyone can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| In fact, I think a couple of commissioners would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| So it's not a fraternal organization or anything like that, but it's a way to have pointed conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3527)|
| 0:58:59| civil conversations about some issues that are pretty, you know, could be divisive, I guess I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| So I think it helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| And the initial impetus for the committee was things would come before us that were education-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| and we'd hash it out like the security, let's use that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| We kind of hashed that out before the school board had a chance to meet, and they felt that, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| the story's been told before we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| So the initial reason for, hey, could you all, and similar with them, if an issue becomes contentious, they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3571)|
| 0:59:41| let's hold on, we could talk about it at the committee level, and then we bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| We bring back the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| We go do some fact findings, put it on as an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| That was the initial focus of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| I don't know what this committee, they'll have to have that same conversation about what their chart is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| All right, we'll have that added for resolution next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| and then we'll also get with Chairman McMillan and get that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3605)|
| 1:00:14| I was talking about a joint meeting at IMES or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| All right, any other items come before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Okay, the commission is adjourned, but what we have is we have judicial applicants at 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| but we also have insolvency at 6.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| But I think the judicial commissioners are going to take longer than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| So without objection, what I'd like to try to do is to recess for 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| have insolvency for a few minutes that won't take very long, and then do the judicial magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Is that within the law, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| If there's no objection, 6.15, back in here for insolvency committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| and then right after that we'll have the judicial magistrate interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Okay, item number three, consideration of resolution of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| approving the method of disposition, public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| or negotiated sale for delinquent tax surplus properties owned by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and approving the sale of the properties for less than taxes owed pursuant to Tennessee Code annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| so on and so on, and fixing the offering price of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Does anyone have any questions or discussions on any of these properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| I'll move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| And we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| That's a record, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Hear, hear, hear, hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| All right, we're going to go ahead and call into order the public forum, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| for the interview or discussion of the judicial magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| And so if it's okay with the body, what we'll do is we'll give each person five minutes to introduce themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3725)|
| 1:02:16| and then we will ask questions, and that won't count against their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| So if that's okay with no objections, that's kind of how we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| I just want to say something before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| And what we discussed, if you all weren't here before we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| the 20th may not be the appointment date, or the 20th will not be the appointment date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| and we'll set another date for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| There's conflict with a couple of the commissioners' travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| And so we will have another date to be determined later this week and for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| So that date has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| And so Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| You know, I have sat on this August body for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3777)|
| 1:03:06| And, you know, I've seen things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| I've seen things flow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| And I just want to publicly state my profound disappointment in our judges as they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3792)|
| 1:03:25| and as things in general over this last few years have just, you all know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| there's not one minority applicant when I know there were qualified minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| or that made it through when I know there were quality people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| female of color that apply for this position, male of color that apply for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| that as I look through the resumes are every bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| and it's not disparaging toward the candidates who made it through the filter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| but I don't understand the filter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| More and more, so now we have probably for the first time in 20, 25 years, at least 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| no African-American representation within this body when there were applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| You know, Judge Cerny, Emory, Howell-Long, Jackson, and Stansbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| I'm just disappointed that we couldn't even get one to vet that you stopped that filter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| And when there were qualified that had cases that worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| that were active attorneys that would have dealt with some of the same type issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| that these magistrates would be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| And, you know, more and more over the last few years it's just taken a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| And that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| And I've sat and I've not said much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| I've not said anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| You know, McKenzie's throwing a race card out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| I've not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| And I'm not doing that now but to say you have to be deliberate about creating a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| and an environment and a community that's welcoming to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| And I think these judges missed the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| What we'll do is we'll call up applicants in alphabetical order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| Y'all didn't see the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Ms. Cravens has withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| So there will be six interviews or six people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| And so, without objection, I'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| And Mr. Alexander Brown, if you don't come and give your name, address in five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| My name is Alexander Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| My address is 7450 Chapman Highway, number 241.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| Some of you have seen me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I've applied for this position in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I had worked at this position extensively long ago, was the primary substitute for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3959)|
| 1:06:11| Back at that time there was some question, things that were brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| whether it was ethical to do criminal law and to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| And I opted to do my criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| I've practiced since 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I've done criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| About 90 percent of my practice has been criminal law in state and in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| I've handled over 65 cases in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| That can be verified through the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| I've handled a little over 1,000 cases that can be verified through gyms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| I've had jury trials in state court, in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| I know criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| That's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| This position requires somebody to know criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| You have to know the difference between somebody who's caught in a house and has stolen $40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| whether to sign a warrant for a burglary or whether to sign a warrant for a theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| You have to be able to understand the difference and the nuances in the law to know the difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4027)|
| 1:07:16| Experience in criminal law is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Experience in working as a judicial commissioner, like I say, I've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I've worked overnights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| I've done the 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| I'm familiar with what it requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| But I'm also familiar with how to work with and how to deal with police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| I get along very well with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| I've made friends with police officers over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| and have maintained those friendships even when I wasn't working and seeing them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| I get along well with the court officers and I get along well with the attorneys in the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| We may be on different sides, but, you know, there's the old saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| you catch more flies with sugar than something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| But that's kind of my philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| It's a path of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| How do you get along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| How can you resolve issues in a civil way and still get the required results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4086)|
| 1:08:16| As I say, I've got experience in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| I've been in Knoxville since 93, came down for undergrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| I went to UT Law School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And I pay my property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| That was the question last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| Let's see, what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| A couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I pay my property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| I can't say that I vote every time, but I think I've voted every time we've had an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| And, you know, overall, I'm a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And I think I would be a – I really think I'm the best candidate for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| because I have the experience both in criminal law, the knowledge in criminal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| and also the experience in the commissioner's office doing this job in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Commissioner Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| This is not a question today from me, but it will – there is a question being raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| and I will have to ask the candidates that are here on the appointment day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| A question is – that may or may not be relevant, but the question will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| is if you're appointed as a judicial commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| will you give up your criminal law practice to which we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| you raised the question of whether or not it was ethical for a judicial commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| to still have private practice in criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| And just a minute before we go any further, I don't – there's no discussion tonight about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| because I'll need to ask that question and receive an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| and then I will be able – be prepared to ask that question when we are at the night of appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| I just wanted the other commissioners to hear that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| because there is some discussion about whether or not the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| that are judicial magistrates have to give up their criminal law private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| Mr. Brown, what timeline were you the substitute judicial commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| I was just – you know, I should have looked up the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I don't know exactly, but I would say around 2003 to 2005 during that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| and I've been on the list as a substitute since then for a little over a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| I got back on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| I've applied for this position several times already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| How much time have you spent in that last year and a half working as a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| And I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| I haven't received any calls in the last year and a half to work as a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I have sat in with Richard Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| I sat in with him on a shift to make sure that I was up to date on the changes that had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| As far as the law and the procedure, there's no changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| but as far as how they do things with Skype and those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| I did sit with him to update myself on those, I guess, mechanics of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4299)|

| 1:11:52| With all due respect to the other candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| I believe I have the strongest resume on this application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| Part of that is because I have more legal criminal experience than anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| and my working relationship with the police officers, the DA's office, and the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| as well as my longstanding ties to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4331)|

| 1:12:32| My paper mill has for nearly 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| My first cousin runs the Chick-fil-A on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| And I have many cousins and uncles, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| who are local professionals or business people, including dinner and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| After graduating from high school, I went to UT undergrad here on an academic scholarship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| and then went on to law school after working for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| I interned in the DA's office for a year during law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| where I handled preliminary hearings and sat second chair on murder trials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| with their major crimes unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| And after law school, I practiced insurance defense and employment law for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| in a private civil firm before leaving and starting my own practice in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| My primary focus has been criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| I've done other things, family law, collections, product solubility, personal injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| credited to handle veterans' claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| But I've mainly done criminal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| In that time, I've represented over 1,000 defendants in state and federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| here in Knox County and other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| And in that time, I've developed a good reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| and working relationship with the DA's and law enforcement and the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| I've had good jury trial experience as well as civil trial experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| My last jury trial was a Class A felony with General Kevin Allen six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| And I've tried jury trials of serious nature with all the DA's who handle those cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| General Fitzgerald, General Nazios, General Morton, General Price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| and, as I said, General Allen as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| What I think is important to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| there are officers in KPD who have vouched for me and will continue to vouch for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| Lieutenant Malone, Lieutenant Willis, Sergeant Schaefer, Sergeant Holmes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| And part of that is not just our relationship in the criminal context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| I've been there to help their families do civil cases when they've needed help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| because they trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| The DA's trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| And General Allen, Charm Allen, will vouch for my character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| and ability to work with their office, my legal ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| I encourage you to call her and ask her those questions yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| And last but not least, I've had the privilege over the last 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| to be asked by the judges to run their courts when they're sick or on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| I've done it three times in the last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| By my count of just letters from the judges thanking me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| I've done it over 14 times in the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and that doesn't include all the times I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| My point is the judges trust me to run their courts when they're not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| to have hearings, to violate people's probations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| to handle all the mechanics of the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| And I've done that, and they've asked me to do it again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| If they can trust me, if General Allen can trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| and the officers can trust me, then you can trust me to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| I did forget one important level of support I need to encourage you to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| I encourage you to call the sheriff and Lee Trammell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| because they are supporters of mine for this position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Even though I do criminal law, the fact that law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| and the DAs are supporting me should count in your minds that you can trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| As far as the judges, they can't come out and say that they support one candidate or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| but I am the only candidate who's sat in their courts repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| to run their dockets when they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Have you done any substitute work, and have you applied for this job before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| I have not applied for this job before, nor have I done any substitute work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Thank you, Mr. Cabbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Next is Mr. Dustin Dunham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Just name and address, please, Dustin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Dustin Dunham, 103 Suburban Drive, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I am the current primary substitute magistrate for the judicial magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I've been substituting since December of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| I'm the substitute that they call when they need time off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| and generally if anyone else is filling in, it's because I was not available to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| I've logged over 3,000 hours on the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| and I believe that that is equivalent when I did the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| to a year and a half of a full-time judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| I've dealt with any and all issues that can come up in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| I've issued thousands of warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| I think a low estimate I came up with the other day was probably around 5,000 applications for warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| probably more than that warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| And that includes all charges in the Tennessee Code for criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| I'm also a criminal defense attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| The focus of my practice is criminal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and I've represented clients in hundreds of cases on anything from as small as a C misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| to as big as an A felony, anything as simple as a public intoxication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| or as complex as a drug conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| And I believe that my experience and background in criminal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| and proven ability to handle this job in the past and now make me the ideal candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| and I'd like to ask for your votes on April 20th when you appoint a new magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| And I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| You made a point of pointing out that you speak Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| In your opinion, of this year and a half that you've performed this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| in a fill-in time, how important has that really played during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| I think that I've probably had to arraign about a dozen people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| They have an interpreter at the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Of course, the officers are English-speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I don't know if there's one that does not speak English as his first language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| but he speaks English very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| But it has come up when they didn't have an interpreter periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| but not something that's a constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| So it's kind of small, if I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Let me ask a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Since you spent so much time there in your dealings there, how many African Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| what percentage of African Americans come before you at the judicial magistrate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| Are you talking because they're accused or as officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Yes, they're accused of, and you haven't set bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I mean, is it 10 to 20 percent or 30 to 40 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| I would say probably around 50, but I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| And obviously I don't know usually when I'm approving a warrant one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| I just know them by their arraignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| In your resume you say you're currently serving 14 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| That's my average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I guess that's one shift and maybe one shift every eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| I don't always do 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Sometimes I'll ask for a half shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Sometimes they'll want me to do the citizen screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| I try to make myself available whenever possible under whatever circumstance they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| But you have been doing this since the last time you applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| and they continue to ask you to come back as the primary substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| I don't know the exact math when I was doing my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| I think it was a month at that time since last July up until when I submitted my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| so that's probably 39 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| It's been published they work 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| They actually work three 12-hour shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| and then one shift once a month that's kind of random,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| so it comes out to about 39 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| So 39 times, I guess, four weeks since it was the last time in July, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4851)|
| 1:21:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I've got one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Who selects the substitutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Maybe I missed that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| When you want to get put on the list, you go and talk to generally the head magistrate is the way I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| I talked to Richard Major when he was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| and then you kind of ask for shifts and somebody will need off and you'll come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| So it's the head magistrate that makes the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| It's the sitting magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| The sitting magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Who needs the time off, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| The list is kept by the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| And then whoever needs off has to facilitate the talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| But there is a list and then they have someone they can choose from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| There's a list of people they've approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| They generally like people to go through some sort of training and dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| It's a different form of gyms than people who practice criminal law are used to dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| and obviously we're usually representing a side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| not judging whether there's probable cause to believe that a defendant committed a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| and the crime they're accused of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| It's kind of a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| Not entirely different, but somewhat different so that they want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| and make sure that people know how to use gyms, know what potential charges are out there, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you, Mr. Doan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| Sharon Frankenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Ms. Frankenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Would you name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| I'm Sharon Frankenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| I live at 232 Medford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| And I'm here applying for the position of judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| I was one of the initial people that was selected by the county commission back in 1994 to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| I did the job for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| At that time, it was made up of four people who eventually became five in an attempt to cover a 24-7 shift period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4980)|
| 1:23:12| And the job itself is basically the same job as it had been back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| The commissioners are responsible for approving search warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| They're responsible for signing arrest warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| They're responsible for reviewing and performing arraignments where you tell people what they're charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| and you set their bond appropriately depending upon the charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| You do need to have some familiarity with criminal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| but basically the type of questions that we're called upon to answer are the same sort of things that you learn in your first year of law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5021)|
| 1:23:49| So it's not any highly technical or sophisticated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Is there enough proof here to go forward with the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| So it's not the final resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| And I also believe that one of the benefits that I have in this process is that I'm neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| I have neither been a district attorney, taken a prosecution stand before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| and I've very rarely been on the defense side either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| So I don't particularly have friends who are policemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| I don't have friends who are with the public defender's office particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| Once again, I've been neutral in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| I believe that that's your responsibility as a magistrate because you're a version, a branch of the judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| You are not intended to take one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| You're supposed to listen to the proof that's before you and make a decision based on the law as you know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and as if you've learned it throughout your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| I grew up in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| I went to Pond Gap Elementary, and I went to Mount Olive Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| and then I went to Cedar Bluff Middle and Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| So I've lived all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I have been a good citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| I have paid my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I have voted every election early and often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| And like I said, I'd like to accept your consideration for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| Anticipation, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| He's getting good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| You said you had worked previously in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Have you served any time as a substitute in recent times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Not as a substitute recently, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| I have my own private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Thank you, Ms. Frankenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Ms. Rhonda Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| Rhonda Lee, 7801 Gill Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5147)|
| 1:25:59| I've been a resident of Knox County for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I love this area, and I plan to spend the rest of my life here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| You probably are wondering what I've been doing for the last 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Well, I've been raising six children, and they all live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| I have five grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Fourteen years ago, I went back to school, got my undergraduate degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| and then went to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| So also, in addition to going to law school, I worked for some top law firms in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| I worked for the U.S. Attorney's Office, worked with the District Attorney's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| I now primarily do criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Most of my clients are indigent, and I would say 75% to 80% of my clients are black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5200)|
| 1:26:54| I know 51% of our population in Knox County are females,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| and I feel like they are underrepresented in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| I feel like I could represent the women and also the men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| but I feel like we need more women coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| I do public servant. I am a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I feel like I could do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| I've spent over 40 hours training for this job voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| I didn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I work right now pretty much almost seven days a week when I'm not in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| and I'm in court every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| I'm at the jails visiting my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I thank the Knox County General Sessions judges for having confidence in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| There was a lot of many qualified people who put their resume in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| and I made the cut, and I thank them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| And I thank you for letting me stand in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| There's a lot of new faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| I'm the new kid on the block, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I think I could bring some fresh ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| I'm energetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| I'm a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I bring integrity and a work ethic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| and I think I could represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Same question for you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Have you served any time working as a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| I have been down there over 40 hours, mostly last summer, training for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| I ran for this position last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| Since that time, I've been pretty much working so much that they haven't asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| but I'm available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Thank you, Ms. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| Mr. Patrick Looper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| Good evening, honorable members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| My name is Patrick Looper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| I live at 7804 Greenwell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| I have, in my adult working career, have 16 years of law enforcement experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5336)|
| 1:29:05| I have 15 years of legal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I've practiced in all the courts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| I've practiced criminal law in the beginning of my legal career an enormous amount, much more than I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| Now my practice consists of criminal, domestic, juvenile work, civil rights work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| In the beginning of my legal career, I ended up taking an enormous amount of court-appointed cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| Again, those folks were indigent folks that needed to have legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| I've tried cases in all the courts in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| I feel like my legal experience has served me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| I think it would assist me in performing the duties of the magistrate's position here in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| My law enforcement experience, I came on the highway patrol in 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| I was a state trooper with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| At one point in my trooper career, I was assigned to the Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| where we instructed officers that came through the academy and the legal subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| I helped many of our recruits learn how to develop their writing skills, learn how to write their warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| learn how to document good report writing, being able to present their cases in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| We have moot court exercises that we conducted there at the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| And we let the officers get on the stand, and we worked on their ability to be professional witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5440)|
| 1:30:50| and being able to express themselves, being able to make their cases as if they were actually doing it in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5450)|
| 1:30:58| So I feel like those things that I've been able to experience through my working career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| would assist me in serving here in the magistrate's position here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| I've not sat as a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| I've not got any experience in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| But I have sat as special master in some of the other courts in the civil division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| So I've had an opportunity to spend some time hearing the facts of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| and giving rulings in some of the domestic courts here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| So I feel like that lends itself to the ability to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| and hear what these officers are going to say whenever they come to the magistrate's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| and they have warrants and they have search warrants that need to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| I think that would tend to help me make good decisions if I'm given the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Just one quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| In your law practice, have you done criminal defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150316?start=5523)|
