| 0:02:08| discussion about the upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| We will walk through tonight and do public forum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| We have one member of the public signed up for that and then we will go to item number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| which is to talk to department heads. One of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| elected officials and department heads has asked to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=142)|

| 0:02:44| Obviously, what will go a lot smoother is if you have a question for say engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| for everybody to think about their engineering and public works questions all at the same time while we have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| department here so they're not playing back and forth back and forth back and forth, but they're all here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| We'll open the floor for additional discussion and then we'll adjourn the meeting. I expect our meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| adjourn no later than 7, but it might be even earlier depending on what the questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| I don't anticipate that we'll go past that, but any questions about tonight's meeting before we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| Welcome to assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| All right. We'll go to the first part of our agenda, which is public forum. We have one member of the public signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Mr. Kevin Hill, you address the podium. I have the timer here on my phone and I will do the best to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| get that started. Thank you very much. You'll have five minutes to address the Commission related to the fiscal year 22 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Please state your name and address for the record, sir. Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| This will be simple. I just want to bring our attention that as we consider the fiscal year that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=226)|
| 0:03:55| before we approved budgets and and funds allocated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| employee compensation that we need to get to the bottom of a serious question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| mismanagement. The highest paid employee in Knox County is the health director, paid higher than the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Yet a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| what should be a very, very, very controlled process of handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| biological and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| medical materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Still, the public still does not have an answer for why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| the vials were thrown away as has been claimed in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| So before that budget is approved and those funds are allocated to that salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| I think it would behoove this body to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| final answer to that. And I can tell you right now having plenty of friends and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| also contacts that are former employees in the health department that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| both in and then friends that work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| general field of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| pharmacy that it is there is an absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| disbelief in what we've heard so far about what happened to those vials and how they got lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| So I realize this is about budget. So that's where I end those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| I just simply state them as an underscore that until there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| credible answer given to this body, those funds should not be approved for expenditure in the coming year. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=323)|
| 0:05:33| Okay, we'll move on to our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| agenda item and talk to our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| I'll invite Sheriff Tom Spangler to address Commission first and then we'll open it up to other questions by our commissioners for department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=339)|
| 0:05:48| Sir, if you would please state your name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Welcome to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| And do your best to speak really. Sorry, is that better? Got to really jam on him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| I'm vertically challenged stature here with this thing. I'll adjust it for the mayor here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| I want to address you all and first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| I want to say thank you to the mayor's office and to Chris Caldwell and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| I know that they diligently worked on this budget and also with with my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| I wouldn't be doing my part if I didn't come back up here and asking the commission to at least look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| at our at our officers again and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| asking, I think I'd ask for right around 8% I believe is what it was and we're getting right at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| And I'm very grateful for that and I know the men and women are grateful for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| But I'm going to at least ask you all to reconsider to maybe add those three other steps in for those people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| captains and below that are under the mayor council. Those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| haven't slowed down and the reason I'm asking this is is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| One is we keep falling further and further behind our sister agency of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| Even with this this increase here, we're still going to fall right around $1,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| on our starting salary with them and I know that that doesn't sound like an awful lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| but you know when you have family and and our young officers that are coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| they're always looking for anything and everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| So that that's one of the reasons. The other big reason is being able to retain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| being able to recruit officers. We all know how things are today and I've gone around some of our local agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| sheriff's offices locally and just to give you an idea of what we're dealing with I think it's either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| next month or July the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| plant over in Oak Ridge is getting ready to hire another I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| think I'm hearing 50 to 75 more people so we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| and count on losing at least I don't know anywhere from three to six or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| Talked to the sheriff over in Anderson County the day before yesterday. He's losing four to the plant. We can't compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| No, there's no county government, city government that can compete with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| but when they leave our agency to take a job that starts them out anywhere from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| $15,000 to $20,000 more, I understand we can't compete with that. We're not going to be able to. You're not going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| But we've got to be able to retain them, so that's why I'm asking for that. Just to give you an idea real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| our starting salary for our base pay for Knox County, the patrol officer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| 38,875.75 and our corrections is 34,329.21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| You have other agencies that we've that we have spoken with and gotten their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| salaries. Part of that is is they also have a little bit more benefits. They also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| insurance is paid and I understand too that it's it's different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I understand that but that's not what when people come to work here what they look at. They look at those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| They look at that starting salary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| you know, I guess I could be one of those I can remember when I first started here. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| didn't think about retirement. I didn't think about putting money back for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I can tell you once I got about 15 years in I started thinking why didn't I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| You know and we tried to educate our officers. Look, early on you need to start that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Lenoir City PD starts out at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| 48,482. They also have a standard benefits of 90% employer paying for single health and 80% paying for family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| Clinton PD starts out at 35. It's a little less, but they have standard benefits, but they also have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| I want to ask this commission to work on and that is the TCRS insurance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| retirement. I think it's imperative that something else that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=598)|

| 0:10:32| It's it's hard to be able to come to a commission and ask them for those things, but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| if I don't go after a career development program, which I'm working on right now and bring that to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| unfortunately anything and everything I bring to you is going to cost money and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| But I'm just asking you to at least consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| here what we're trying to do, what we want to do for the officers to make sure that we retain those employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| not just the officers, but also our administrative staff, our civilian staff that is there, everybody within that agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| During the COVID, I know I came to this commission asking for that $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| There was people in there that didn't get that $1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| but they were support staff and they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Our support staff within our teleserve unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| we can't operate, our officers cannot operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| that agency without those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| So I want to make sure that you understand that I'm asking for everybody within this agency and that's who I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Any questions for Sheriff Spangler from Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Sheriff, how many patrol officers do you have out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Well, you're talking about certified, you're talking about uniformed people in a patrol car, you're talking about detectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| I'm talking about people in the patrol car. You and I spoke, you know, I'm for the guy that meets the bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| Well, I understand that the detectives are also doing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| So, you know, when you talk about patrol people, yeah, they are the backbone because they're visible outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| They're out there in that traveling billboard, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| As far as patrol officers, I want to, I'm guessing when I tell you this right offhand, probably about 120, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=732)|
| 0:12:22| Can we, you can get these numbers later for us, just guessing, how many corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| Corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Everyone in the corrections out there, they're dealing with the bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| And, you know, what they did, and I say they, because they get all the credit for it, what they did during COVID was above approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:46| When we had, I think I was told, out of, when it started, 1,200 inmates, we had 50, 55 people that end up getting COVID out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=766)|
| 0:12:57| And we were able to isolate that and not spread what a job those people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| So, that number, you're probably looking at close to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Patrol, your captains, do they get out and patrol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| So, when you ask for captains and below, they're out there meeting the bad guy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| And how much is that 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Well, it's a three-step, and each step is, and Chris can answer that question, right around $320 a step, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:40| Approximately $900,000 a step, he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Oh, for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| So, just under a million dollars for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| And just to point out, too, on our budget proposal, pages 29, 30, and 31 have headcounts and it breaks it down to patrol, to detect different headcounts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=828)|
| 0:14:02| So, there may still be some of the answers you're looking for right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Just to confirm, Chris, that's $900,000 total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you, Mr. Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:14| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Good afternoon, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| On page 18 of our summary by fund, in your budget originally, you asked for under patrol and COPS universal, whatever designation that is, $77.3 million, and you were approved for $74.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:37| So, was that some part of the million dollars for the raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And then, what was the additional amount that you were looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Well, the additional amount, the three steps that I was asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| Well, if you take 77.3 and subtract 74.6, that's almost $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| So, a million was salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| What was the other $2 million for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Do you remember what that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:08| Let me see if Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| If you could, Allison, just state your name and your department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Allison Rogers, Knox County Sheriff's Office, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Chris Caldwell and his staff, they actually do all the salaries and benefits for the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| They actually figure all the salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| We did turn in an 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| The Sheriff wanted to ask for 8% for everyone, well, for captains and below, and then a 4% for civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| But that is calculated in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| We did not do that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| It's the majority of the raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Did you want to add anything, Mr. Caldwell, to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| And just, again, clear your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Did you see what I'm talking about on page 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| The only other expenses that would have been in there is things that we went over with the Sheriff and Allison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| where we reduced operating expenses, maybe in the contractual services or supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| But they work in contempt with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=975)|

| 0:16:20| Sheriff, did you say you wanted them to be a part of TCRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Did I hear that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| As opposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| The 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| That they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Those who are not under UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Oh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=994)|
| 0:16:34| So, you're talking about your newer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| Yes, current ones who are not covered and new ones coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:43| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Director Caldwell, I thought the Sheriff's deputies that are not on the UOP were on a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| Is it a straight 401K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| What does the county match on that 401K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It's a STAR plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| It's called the STAR plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| It's the officers put in 6%, the county matches 10, and there's a 2% MERC on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1022)|
| 0:17:12| So, it's basically they put in 6% and get a 12% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| But it's straight DC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| And the state plan, I think, requires, and I'm probably wrong about this, but a match from the county of 9%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| I'd have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Could be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Sheriff, you spoke about losing officers to other departments due to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| I mean, and I understand, I can definitely understand, but can you tell me how many were down because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Like, what is our loss of officers right now that we're trying to compensate for, patrol or whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| Well, excuse me, patrol and corrections, either way, they're either going to a job that pays more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| or either getting out of law enforcement altogether, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| That's the two things on our exit interviews that we've had the most since January anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| And, you know, those numbers, I think we lost three correction officers last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Two are going to something completely outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| And another one is moving out of town because of his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| So this is something that's continuing, and for them to just be getting out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| either because of money or getting out of law enforcement completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I've got to work on something to make sure that we retain those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| Could you also, I didn't hear you speak it earlier, but could you tell us real quick again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| the amount of money that you pour into the training of these officers when we do lose them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| On an average, and this is a ballpark average, you're looking at about $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| by the time that that individual hits the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| By the time they go through the academy, which is 12 weeks, and then they do a 14-week FTO program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| where they arrive with officers and train for those 14 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| That training with not only the time that's put into it, but also compensating those officers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| When I say compensate, you're subtracting the time that they put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| That money, that's where we get the $50,000 from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| So on an average, if we have, just to give you an example, having an academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| and you have one drop out on the first day and they say, well, this is not what I thought it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and then you lose two more three weeks later saying that they just went out of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| We're putting a lot on them, and we're expecting a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| And I think this community and this body here expects the best that we can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| So we're going to make sure we keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| So it's safe to say per X amount of patrol officers we've lost, that $50,000 worth of training goes with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| It goes right out the window with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| What we do with the people who go through the academy, we make them sign a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| that they will stay with us for at least three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| And we kind of calculate that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| If they leave before that, then it goes down or goes up, whichever way it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| But we want them staying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| When that contract is signed, it's to commit themselves to an agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| When I worked over in Blount County, we did the same thing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| But obviously you can't get that kind of money out of them when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| So it starts out, you pay the county back either $3,000 if you leave within the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| Is there a contractual agreement in the corrections side as well, or just patrol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| No, but it's something that I asked about two weeks ago, so it's something that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I have a couple questions, Sheriff Spangler, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| What was the last time a salary study was done to really analyze the whole marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| and the competitive nature of other agencies in our region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:13| It would have been 2016, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| The last salary study was done by Lou Rabinowitz from the Personnel Technology Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| He did one in 2000, I believe another one several years later, and then the last one was 2016-17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| Could you provide that latest report to all the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| And then you talked about a new one being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Is that something that's already been contracted to be done, or are you just in the planning phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| No, it's already been contracted to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| It's with Evergreen Group, and they have our information now and are working on the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| They hope to have it done in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Okay, so it will be done sometime in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Could you also provide the commission with the contractor engagement letter with Evergreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| so we can see what the scope of work is so we can better understand what they hope to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| that's different from three years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| And then, Sheriff Spangler, you talked about that especially when we talk about Oak Ridge or other agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| it's virtually impossible to compete on a level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| No matter if we raised it, they would raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| If we raised it again, they would raise it, and this is a continuous issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Are there other ways to incentivize people beyond base pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| I mean, have you guys looked at other ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| If we're never going to win that game, it doesn't matter what we pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| you're always going to go somewhere else for higher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So it seems like we ought to find more innovative ways to figure out what is the motivation to stay on the force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| or to engage or to be part of our team long term if we're always going to lose that other variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| And that was what I had mentioned earlier about other things to be able to do that, but it's going to cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| One of the things I mentioned was a career development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Let's start with the officers that are here for a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| There are steps for them to move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Those that don't want to be a supervisor, that's the only way that you really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| outside of getting an annual raise, that's the only way that your pay goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| So with that, there are officers and individuals who just do not want to be a supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| so let's find those steps to move them up to where they can, in a lack of better words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| there's a promotion there just in their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Also, tuition. Let's look at higher education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Let's start paying our officers for their associates and their bachelors and their masters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Those are some of the things that we've been looking at now, and honestly, we looked at it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| I just didn't put it in this budget because I was trying to get that salary up on the beginning of it, their base salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| So that's something that I'm going, you can bank on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I'm coming to you with some of those things coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| And then my last question is, are there any other savings, departments, attrition, positions you don't need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1442)|
| 0:24:12| equipment that isn't needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Have you guys examined any other savings across the board that could be then turned into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| instead of just getting bigger and then adding more salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| to sort of be more efficient and effective or just adapt how we do policing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Well, and part of that was when I first come in, we did away with some of the chiefs that retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| so I created either correctional and or patrol positions, and that's what I'll continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| Those positions that we find that are not needed for those salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| then that's what I'm going to do with those to keep from coming to you all and asking you for more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| But is there anything in this budget year that you've identified as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| either equipment or people that you don't need that we could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Not in this year's budget, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Okay. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| How many of those chiefs' positions did you eliminate? What was that savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| If I'm correct, and Allison, I want to say six, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| I believe you did. I believe at least four to six were eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| I mean, it saved a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Is there a breakdown of that that I could get through email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Are there any other questions for Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Are there any other questions for Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Okay. Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| All right. We'll open up the floor to other department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| if there's specific questions from our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Again, we don't have lights, so just kind of raise your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| and then we'll identify what department or question you have in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| whether it be for our finance department, Mr. Caldwell, or any one of our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Mr. Caldwell, if you go to page 15, and since we've got some new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| there's a couple things maybe that might be of information to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| The first thing is the trustee commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| And then also on page 19, the last entry is for the million dollars is the county trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| Can you explain how those are related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Yeah. The trustee's commission on page 15 is what Trustee Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| is statutorily required to charge departments, which goes back to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| which helps to pay for his salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| And so there's a trustee's commission you will find in every fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| And then on page 19, under county trustee, that's his operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| which does not include salaries and benefits, as he does a letter of agreement on salary with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1618)|
| 0:27:07| So this is his expenses as it relates to contractual services and supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| Okay. And so the same thing holds true on page 15, about the 12th one down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| for the county clerk because they receive revenue from their services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| and this is just part of their operating budget then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| County clerk, just like the trustee, this does not include their salaries nor benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| Those are filed in a separate salary suit or letter of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Keep on going. Get all your questions out. You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Same page 15, third from the bottom, the ADA office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Back in 2020 it was a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| There's no appropriations this year for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Has that been folded into something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Yeah, ADA now is, and this budget is in the HR budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| and then we have created an ADA fund, which is a capital fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| to start taking care of our ADA report that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| Okay. Page 16, the UT Knox County Extension Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| the budget for that went up about, what, $150,000 or more from two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| No, if you look at adopted in 21 to proposed in 22, it's about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Okay, excuse me. Yeah, I'm looking at the actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Actual for 20, so you keep in mind, actual for 20 is going to be skewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| because of the pandemic, and so we try to freeze expenses and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| So what you're going to see in the actual for FY20 is a lot of anomalies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| as it relates to total expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| UT Knox Ag Extension is something that the expense that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| and some expenses are paid for through UT as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Hold on a second. Take a breath. I'm going to go around the horn and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Well, just to help answer the question, Chairman Jay and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| and Charlie sit on the Ag Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| and they added one more position this year for a, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| they're not going to call it a minority position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| but it's for to get out there to those schools and have these kids, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| learn about how to grow gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| So I think some of that, Chris, is part of that salary that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Commissioner Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Chris, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| I saw something that struck me pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| is there's no funds for the sexual offender registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Is that pushed in underneath something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| We estimate and appropriate that every month that we bring to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| It's not budgeted for up front in any year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| That's the same with DARE as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Okay, I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Parks Department, and again, so people understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| what I did was I looked at what the actual numbers were for 2020 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| what the requested, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| the proposed for 2022 was since those were hard numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| So under recreation administration in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| it was 1.1 million and now it's gone to 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| So $400,000 increase in park recreation or administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| Anybody from parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| You'll see a decrease in park maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| So some of that is moving people around from one category to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| And we're pulling it up here to go through the other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| But part of that is moving people from park maintenance to recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| That's only about $50,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| But anyways, so our administration of recreation has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| And that's on page 16, about 10th thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1895)|
| 0:31:47| $80,000 increase in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Part of that's health insurance that people maybe have left that had single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| and people who came in had family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| On that same page, 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| from the bottom under the health department it says health administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| It looks like from FY 2020 it was $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| Now it's gone up $650,000 to $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Mr. Parton can explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Ultimately we look at health department as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and health department as a whole went up about a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| If you could just state your name and department for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Kevin Parton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| And do your best to kind of jump right in the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| What you see in that is a lot of our administration salaries, benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| things of that nature were pushed off into CARES funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Roughly $2 million of FY 2020 overall in the health department was taken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| of our budget and reimbursed through the CARES Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| And also what you'll see is we basically shut down in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and therefore we didn't have the expenditures that we normally have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| So now the true cost is going to show up for what's for 2022 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| For 2022 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Assuming that our services go back to a new normal, then yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| I have a health department question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| And then on the next page, 17, the first one, the school health programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| is that to fund the school health nurses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| We fund five nurses, a nutritionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and then there's a virtual behavioral liaison that was added into the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Mr. Prang, I noticed on page 33 the health department head count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| the proposed in the ‑‑ I mean, it's gone up by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| it looks like 18 full‑time, 11 part‑time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Is that, again, from the result of taking people off and putting them back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| or are those new programs or services or a combination of the both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| It would be a combination of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| And is that going to be one or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| It's truly more grant funded in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| We actually only requested two full‑time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| or a part‑time and a full‑time position on county funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Okay, so most of those are grant funding on a federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Or state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Yeah, I know a lot of those grants come with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| this person has to administer it and this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| And then, of course, if that grant funding then were to run out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| or run its course, we don't retain those people, bring them on for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| That is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Any other health department questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Do you want to just, I know we still have an outgoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| we have an outstanding investigation by Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Is that still ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| What is the potential, what's the timeline for results of that investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| We're looking at mid‑May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I should have all of the requested testing in by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| I met with them last week and spoke about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Talked to Mr. Hotz and he's expecting mid‑May into June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| And then, obviously, when that gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| if you'll make sure the commission gets a copy of that final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Any other health department questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I have a different, you want to jump in with something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Just looking again, looking at page nine and then again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| further in the budget, could you talk a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| our bonded debt is going to go up $45 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| but we also had some significant reductions in the last fiscal year due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| refinancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Can you talk a little bit about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I know there's a specific reason for the increase related to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| but can you also talk about both the reason for the increase and also where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| you foresee in your crystal ball potential refinancing options in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Because I think that's something that gets overlooked quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| So, no doubt that the increase that you saw last year and this year related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| to our bonded indebtedness centers around the three elementary schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| we are constructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| And so it is true that we have done some bond refinancings and refundings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| have led to some savings for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Also historically because of our bond rating being a double A plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| anytime that we go to the bond market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| we not only get a good interest rate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| right now rates are probably around two or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| We also usually get a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| So oftentimes what we'll do is just pay that premium down on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So instead of borrowing 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| we may borrow 70 if we get a premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Now sometimes though we'll take it the approach that if money's really cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| maybe we want to use that premium for a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| And so we try to watch it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Historically though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| if you look over the last eight or nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| we have as a percentage of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| we have a percentage of debt service of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| We've gotten our percentage of debt service of the budget down to about below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| eight and a half percent, I believe, which I think is a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And so there will be ebbs and flows as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| projects and things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Oftentimes what you will see and you'll see coming soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| schools is partaking in phase three C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| I think of energy efficiency with train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| And we're looking at one as well to do led lights in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| And so oftentimes that will add to your, your bonded indebtedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| but what gets overlooked is those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| They're pay for themselves, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| So the savings that schools will see from doing this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| the savings are used to pay for that debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| So while you're, you're bonded indebtedness is going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| there is a mechanism there to pay for it through, through, through savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| And so, you know, a lot of that's important to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| I think we've done a good job of paying down debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| but also doing projects that we think are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Well, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| while we're on the same thing, page 10 of the budget document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| the principal paid an FYI 2021 was 68.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| And on the page 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| it shows that we had an adopted budget of 76 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Did we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and the way it's classified in here is principal paid in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| So did we not have to make as much debt payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| So what you're looking at in principal paid in 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| there are some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| some refundings on that page that throw that page off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| So you're not just looking at that principal that was paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| It's also on the, on the bond issued side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Sometimes we'll wait and issue bonds and do two years in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| And so that could be what that is related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| And so I'm trying to read them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| the notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| So we had some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| some refundings that lead to those principal paid to look a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| off. And so we didn't ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| if you go back to 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| our debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2411)|

| 0:42:18| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2538)|

| 0:42:32| that 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2552)|

| 0:42:38| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| we're just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2559)|

| 0:42:43| Once the board has approved the use of those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| we'll be coming back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2566)|

| 0:43:00| Did Knox County schools or their Knox County sheriff's office fund those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| positions in those 14 schools where the officers were pulled out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| So the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| and I defer this to Ron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I think KPD and the city pays for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2593)|

| 0:43:18| with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| And so I don't think as of this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2599)|

| 0:44:05| on capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| we would have to be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| if we wanted to fund one of those or how many capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2647)|

| 0:44:28| we potentially could look at that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| and it's a legitimate issue of overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| So there's overcrowding in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| we maybe could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| could be approved for that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| I think replacement schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| would be really difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| for Azure 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| we're waiting guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| We're going to have lengthy discussions with the board of education too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| we're going to be looking at that process pretty carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| And we know these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| these funds will be heavily monitored also by the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| director Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| this is an overall budget question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| looking forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| it's very easy to see a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| an economy in which interest rates are rising and inflation becomes part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| our economic future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| as far as interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| how interest rate sensitive is our debt service right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| And as far as inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| when you collect sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| inflation can be helpful because prices go up and your basis for collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| off of goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| But at a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| people begin to restrict their spending and it can hurt sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| So in an,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| in an overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| big picture kind of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| could you talk about how conservative this budget is in terms of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| able to possibly deal with these two economic factors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I think from an inflationary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| you're correct as it relates to sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| it can be good to a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| And there comes a point where it's counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| And so that's not for us to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| It's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| it's a little bit similar to the gas tax in the sense that once gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| gets so high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| people buy less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| And so you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| you don't get as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I think this budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| conservative in the sense that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| what we projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| we would end this fiscal year with and local option sales tax is all we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| for sales tax and FY 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| And a couple of reasons for that one being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| the market was flooded with federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| And so people went and did things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| federal pandemic unemployment money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| and then this year they may take vacations and not stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| So I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| I think you actually make it see a dip in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| so we think we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| we were conservative on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| on sales tax in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| your first question related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| How much exposure to interest rate sensitivity do we have in our debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| So we do have some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| some debt that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| that is variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| but the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| but we've done a good job of trying to get our debt to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| to be fixed rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| So everything that we've issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| since I've been the finance director has been fixed rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| it's very vanilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| It's boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I think boring is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| we'll watch that variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| There could come a point on some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| on some of our swaps where if it gets too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| we initiate that swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| so we'll watch things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| but I think in the short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2872)|

| 0:48:29| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| that's what I think we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| I think we have traditionally allowed allocated for debt service at the max of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| what our adjustables could go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Are we still allowing at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| So we budget for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| we budget for our variable rate debt at four and a half%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| And so that's what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| you would have saw that we were projected to use six or seven million dollars of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| and the debt service fund. And you look at it and we use barely any. Well, part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| because our variable rate debt that we're paying is really low right now, right? And so sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| that helps. So we always budget very conservatively in the sense that we want to project that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| going to pay a higher interest rate knowing that we probably won't. And so you would have noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| that our debt service budget this year actually went down like two million dollars. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2950)|
| 0:49:19| the mayor about hit me over the head over this and so you have to explain it. Ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| what that's done is over the past few years of paying down our principal on debt and doing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| refundings, then our planned payments go down, right? And so what we're doing is we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| so we're still making our planned principal payments, but our interest rates a little less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| And so thus that budget goes down. And so, but if you look at what we've paid, we've not paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| nearly like the 76 that was budgeted for in 21. And back to the sheriff's request about the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| retirement fund. Is that something we can look into to compare what the cost is today on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| asset match plan for? Yeah, I think we can have a conversation with the state and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| how TCRS works and how it would work for us and, you know, what the buy-in is. So keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:26| it's easy to transfer new employees, right? But what's the buy-in if others who are in STAR wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| to go? And if they want to go, what's that lump sum payment and does it come out of STAR and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| all that works, but definitely can have that conversation. Okay. Thank you, sir. And really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| really quick commissioners can go back to your question on 10. If we had 56 million in refundings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3043)|
| 0:50:53| in 21. So that's why that number is looks a little strange in the total column of the bonds issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| and the principal paid because it shows up in both. Commissioner Steelmaker, you have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3060)|
| 0:51:09| more questions? Two more, I promise, and then that's it. That's okay, that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| For educational purposes, on page 17, number 14 from the bottom, payment to cities of $155,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:24| What is that designation for? Ultimately, we pay the city...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:54| Can I say my last one? That's a good question. It's not often you stump Jennifer. I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3114)|
| 0:52:13| She's got the answers, she just builds us down. Okay. So this is where we collect all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| alcohol beverage tax and have to remit to the city their portion. I don't know everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| I promise. Thank you. And then just last quick question, noticed on page 18 under the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| assessor that the headcount for the previous year is identical to this year, but yet their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| went up 15%. So is that because we're getting ready to go into a reapportionment year and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| is for extra overtime or because it's about $650,000 of additional funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| Reappraisal and new software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3173)|

| 0:53:01| Mr. McPherson, I have a quick question. I'm looking at page 13 of your budget where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| talks about the central cafeteria. I think I just heard something about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| it would be a new program or availability for funding so children in our schools did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| to pay for lunches? Yes, sir, that's correct. We're continuing that. I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I mean, this is just the expense side I'm seeing, I'm not seeing the revenue side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| but tell me a little bit about how that might affect this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I may have to defer to Mr. Oaks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Okay. Yeah. Mr. Oaks, if you would just state your name and department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools Operations Office. In the school nutrition budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| our projected revenue and our projected expenses are equal. So when you're looking at one number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| the other number will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| It's like $27 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Yes. Yeah. So we're, well, we're projecting a similar number next year if that's, if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3235)|
| 0:54:03| what you're looking at. Yeah. So we had to, as a matter of fact, we had to change our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3243)|
| 0:54:12| about three weeks ago when the Department of Agriculture announced that they would extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| the free meals for all kids through the 21-22 school year. So the number you're seeing on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| revenue is corrected in our projection for that. We anticipate that our revenue in the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| will be higher than our revenue in this year because we had so many days where we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3274)|

| 0:54:46| meals that were still available to them. And when we lose a school day, it's about $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| loss to us at that point because we don't have revenue coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| but we still have the same expenses going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3300)|

| 0:55:32| Is this a pass-through money from federal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| It's a combination of revenue from meals that we sell and reimbursement from the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3335)|

| 0:55:47| reimbursement and they pay us back at a specific rate, something north of $3 per meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3347)|

| 0:56:18| you know, but that's what the federal government tells us we got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| So that's what we got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I think y'all do a good job at it, I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Commissioner, hold on, stick around for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Commissioner Smith and then I'll go to Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Russ, this could be for you or Mr. Ferguson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:40| In your budget, you have a 4% increase across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Is there any talk about custodial staff and cafeteria staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| I know I think I heard Representative Watson say something about if federal monies came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| but I didn't think you could use that for reoccurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Did he mean BEP money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| I'll let Ron talk about that, but let me just say one thing on the cafeteria staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| They are in line for the same 4% everybody else gets and for our cafeteria staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| Non-management staff, year before last, we gave them a 5% in a year where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| the rest of our employees only got a 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| So we're trying to keep up with the market there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| What about custodial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| We are looking at that and I think Mr. McPherson may be closer to that number than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| Yes, Commissioner, you mean with respect to the 4% increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| Yes, they're included, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| But it's just four, no more for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Oh, no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Because I'd heard talks and hopes of aid for custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Yes, you're referring to, there was an amendment on the Board of Education when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| approved the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| The amendment stated that if additional BEP funds are received, that money could be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| or that money must be applied to some of our lower paid categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| That would be custodians, school secretaries, and teacher assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And those are the more difficult ones to fill and to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| We received our first BEP estimate last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And there's good news and bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Good news is, is our estimate was, I mean, within less than, I mean, it's not even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| percentage off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:29| But we were hoping we were a little bit wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| We were hoping it would be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| We will also be getting a May and a June estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| So, we're hopeful the May estimate and the June estimate will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Typically, we do see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| But we're a little bit concerned in the sense that this may stay relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3528)|
| 0:58:57| Because there's a hold harmless provision in the BEP, in BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| And it looks, it appears, Knox County Schools is included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Simply because, so that hold harmless provision is for districts who have experienced a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| a reduction in enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| And so, we, it looks like those districts who have been held harmless will not benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| from the inflationary growth factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| If that's the case, then this BEP amount may stay relatively steady through the next couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| of iterations of the estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| And so, then that would lessen the opportunity to be able to provide an additional increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| for those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| I guess my question relates to moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| Secretaries, custodians, food service are trusted, important members of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| And we're getting to the point that they're at McDonald's wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| And if we want to get people that we can trust in our schools, we're probably going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| to address that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Commissioner Biggs, I think, was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| It was basically what Commissioner Fitts was going to ask about the pay increases for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| cafeteria workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| So, my next, I do have another question, but it's not pertaining to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:18| Any other school questions, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| Ron, I apologize for calling you period there a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| He'd probably take that as an insult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| For the public's knowledge, your monthly payroll this coming budget year, how much will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:41| Well, I didn't have that number with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| I could calculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Don't hold me to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| I'm going to say between $35 and $40 million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| So, you take $40 million times the 12 months out of the $543 million budget, 80% of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3648)|
| 1:00:59| payroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Probably about 82%, 83%, I think, Joe, is probably payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| See, a lot of people, you know, and me too, I look at it at $542 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| That's a lot of money, but 80% of it is in salaries, benefits, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| I just wanted...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| No, that's a great point, Commissioner, because, and that's probably pretty typical for in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| the education industry because it's so service oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Yeah, it's very labor intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you, Mr. Dick Pearson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| No, Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Are substitutes included in anywhere in this pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| Not in the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| We do have incentives for substitutes that we're looking, we included it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| It's like $300 to $500 more a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Does that sound right, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I think $300, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| So, it's based on the more days you can, now there's a limit, but the more days you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| sub, then the more money you would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| This past year, the school year almost ended, it was an extremely challenging situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| because of COVID and the quarantines and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| So, it does not include subpay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| The 4% does it, but there are built-in incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Okay, thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| I do have a question, and it's actually, I hate to do this, but it's for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3745)|
| 1:02:36| Given the increase I see in disease surveillance and investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| vital records, women's health services, and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| I would say, you know, those are COVID-related, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| We added a position in disease surveillance, nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| We added a part-time physician in women's health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| and then vital records is caused by the issuance of birth and death certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| So, those positions are obviously full-time, so those numbers won't be decreasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| One of them is part-time, sir, and one of them is full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| So, the reason I'm asking is I saw where we went, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| it was requested at $1.3 million, and in 2020 it was $741,000, adopted $1.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:29| and so I was just making sure that that's what that was, was COVID-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| It was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Page 51 of our budget on our capital improvement plan, this is building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Can you help me understand why the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| our portion of that is double of every year thereafter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| Is there something significant this particular upcoming fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| So, anything that is done to the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| we have 70% of the occupants, so we pay 70% of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| so we pay the same percentage as the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| And so, ultimately, us and the city agreed to $2 million worth of building improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| and so that's why our number is the 1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| So, the years thereafter, just baselines to kind of put a placeholder in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| but it varies every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3869)|
| 1:04:29| Do you know of any, what any major improvements are this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| We could look at those and see what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| I've got the list in my office, but not right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| If you could just send that to us, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| And if you could just state your name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Chris Davis, Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Your budget has gone up 10% or so this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| but I know you've been doing a lot of investment in sort of our next level of election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| things that are coming up, some equipment, some facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| and I just wanted to make sure everybody understood what it is we're investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Commissioner Caldwell, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Mr. Caldwell may be able to speak to this a little bit more eloquently than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| but I can tell you we've requested an additional staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| Just to kind of give you a lay of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| often compare us to Shelby County, Hamilton County, Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| what I would call peer counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We are by far the lowest staffed among all of those four major counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| And in fact, give you an idea, example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| despite having probably 70,000 fewer registered voters in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| they have five more full-time staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| So we requested one more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| There are some costs that we anticipate as we move forward with paper ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| One of those things that jumped up on us was the price of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| Paper is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| People wanted paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| We're getting paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| And paper costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| More ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| We moved into a new facility out west to help us primarily in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| One of our biggest goals was to be able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| the demand for space that absentee ballots required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| And if you'll remember, we had a far and away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| I would call a record, I'd call historic number of absentee ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| So when you combine all of those things plus some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| supplies that I know were thrown in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| we looked at one of the requests I made was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| I think somewhere in the neighborhood of $20,000 for an increase in supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And that was nothing but printer bags to hold printers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| We'd never had to use printers before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| That's one of those things I didn't think out very well in the short end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| But ultimately, I think that it's a good combination of mostly what I asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| Would you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Yeah, and I think ultimately with the Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| it's never a year-to-year comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| It's 22 you've got to compare to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4016)|
| 1:06:56| And so, and one other expense in here that increased would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| in every budget in all funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| there was an increase in IT support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| And that has to do with the ability to work remote and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| And so, they get new devices and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| And so, that increases and that trophy is cost up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| And obviously, I don't need to tell you all that internet security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| you know, the Russians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| we haven't heard the word Russians and hacking and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| I know you don't like hearing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| I don't like hearing them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| And so, we pay top dollar to make sure that we don't hear words like Russian and hacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| and fraud and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| And I think it was last fiscal year we invested in the new machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Do we have an idea of the shelf life of those, give or take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Well, we've been told a decade plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| And hopefully, that gets me to close to retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Cross my fingers, maybe that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| But certainly, I would expect at least a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| I will tell you the last machines we had lasted about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4079)|
| 1:07:59| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4079)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Hi, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4083)|
| 1:08:03| How you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| You talk about storage for these paper ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| How long are we required to hold those after an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Depends on the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Any federal election or election that has a federal request, at least one federal race on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| we're required to hold it for 22 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| Everything else, like a county primary or city elections, is six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| But that's a good question because there's a lot of paper to store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| I guess this question is for Director Caldwell or the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Looking at the price of gas and where it looks like it's headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| how much flexibility do we have in our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I know the sheriff's department and our engineering public works both use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| a considerable amount of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| So we often take a conservative look at fuel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| But what we often will do is when fuel is fluctuating like it has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| so like when Allison would have submitted her budget request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| fuel was probably cheaper than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| So knowing Allison, she probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| had the foresight to add a little bit more just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| And some departments will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Often, though, when you'll get our designation list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| if gas continues to go like it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| you'll see a designation for a certain amount for gasoline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| so we can help departments get through the year if gas continues to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Commissioner Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4184)|

| 1:09:47| do we pay the state gasoline taxes as a county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4193)|

| 1:09:58| or when Allison and the sheriff's office uses their pilot cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4198)|

| 1:10:31| I know in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4231)|

| 1:10:37| I can look on Facebook or Twitter and I see you're at Maloney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| or you're at Alcoaway doing projects that probably wouldn't have got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| So I am so proud of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| I think you're doing an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| and I think you're spending your money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| That being said, this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| what's going to be due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| What are we going to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Are you looking at anything that we can be looking out for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| So for the capital projects that I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| that looks like that's going to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| there were two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| One is to redo a roofing out at our Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| That roof has not been redone pretty much since it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| So that's an expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| The second item was an approval for a countywide parks master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| We are way overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Our current master plan is about 11 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| They're supposed to be updated every five to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| There is now state funding that requires it to be updated every five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| in order for us to be eligible for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| We're leaving money on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| The trail study that we did, Greenway study, two years ago, now I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| is that obsoleted now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| It is still active for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| and it'll be included within the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| It'll be an attachment to the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| but they won't redo those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| That's all I got for Shauna, unless anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Commissioner Dirk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Are there any maintenance or updates for any playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| or anything like that in this coming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Not in this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| This last year, I think we had about $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| to update surfacing for playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Okay, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| So, anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Any other parks questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Commissioner Dirk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4351)|

| 1:15:26| We have got a million and a half more than what we than we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| So we'll be able to pay probably around 60 to 65 miles of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| which historically we do between 40 and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| So very thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Our new paving management system is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| We are finalizing the paving list to get ready for our upcoming new paving budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| So I'll provide that to you all as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| one of the things that we're doing this year in solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| is we're going to look about doing a kind of an analysis of how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| you know, how we spend that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| You know, we spend a lot of money, about $3 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| to, you know, haul and dispose of landfill waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| So we're actually going to embark upon a study and try to see if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| you know, what ways we can maybe, you know, better do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| how we can maximize that, be more efficient in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| So those are a couple of things that I would like to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| but I'll get you at least that paving list to all the commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| in the next week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| How much is a ton of asphalt now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Right now it's about $85 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| It is adjusting down now, surprisingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| But as we bid it this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I would anticipate to see a little bit of flat price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| But the good thing is we're protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| We use a index adjustment that TDOT publishes monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that they check with all the asphalt suppliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| And we actually, we won't, that index fluctuates month to month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| So that way, you know, we don't, the contractor bids on knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| so we don't have all that risk loaded into that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| So it's been a good thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| And so I would anticipate to be somewhere in the $85 to $90 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| What's the average tons per mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I mean, it'll fluctuate, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Yeah, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| In a subdivision, you know, because it's 26 feet wide and you've got cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| it takes us about $135,000 to pave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| I'd have to convert that into tonnage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| but about $135,000 to pave a mile of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| And then on a, you know, a collector road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| like a tipping station where you've got a 20 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| that's probably in the neighborhood of about 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| And then like I said, just divide, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I don't have that number in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| but you just divide that by 85 and get the number of tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| I get asked some, I think the John Sevier Convenience Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| is probably one of the top recyclers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| I get asked about glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| And do you think we'll ever get back to recycling glass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| The weight just doesn't really make it, you know, economical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| I know the city's going, I've heard that they're going away from it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| Their contractor's doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| So that's one of the things we're going to try to look at with this analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| is to try to figure out ways to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| try to save some cost in that and maybe look at different revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| I can speak to that on a national level, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| The whole entire country's going away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| It's actually cheaper to throw it in a landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| and it'll disintegrate in the landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| and not cause anything for a lot less than it is to recycle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I know, we got to that, we got to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Yeah, it's not, it's really not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| We went away from it five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| We're never going to go back, to be honest with you, nobody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| There's one thing that, you know, I try to tell who I get a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| Do not throw cardboard in the container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Cardboard is the worst thing for a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| It takes, if it's $10 for this square and that cardboard is mostly air and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| it's taking up space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| So when I'm at the convenience center and I see people throw a big piece of cardboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| if I'm in, not in this type of clothes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| I've been known to get it out and put it in a cardboard recycler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| So it's stuff like that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| I mean, just stop and look how much cardboard is thrown in the waste compactor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| that really needed to be recycled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| and would save us on tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| How much is a tonnage to the, we just did the contract about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| Let me remember what the tonnage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Let me glance at it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I've got it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4782)|
| 1:19:42| I just don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| I know it sounds petty or whatever, but every little bit does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| I mean, especially on cardboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| It's unbelievable the cardboard that's, could be recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Are there other engineering public works questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Whenever, whenever we have a Knox County school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| or another entity of Knox County government subcontract out work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| such as paving at the school or landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| or maybe even mulching and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Do we check with EPW first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Do we just automatically go and outsource those to a third party company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Or do we see if actually Knox County can do it at a cheaper rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| We, they often, a lot of folks do check with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| and we do things for libraries and schools and parks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| So yeah, I think we've got to develop a good relationship with those other departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| and certainly oftentimes can do things a lot cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| because of the labor is already built into our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| So with that being said, whenever we're working with the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| TDOT, and doing specific road projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| does the state ever look at us for doing some of those projects at a cheaper rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Because I know a lot of times we have a specific matching portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| that we have to do on some of those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Do they do that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| They do. Their processes are very cumbersome, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| But we do a lot of the management of the design in-house that they benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| So we don't necessarily do as much hard reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| but we do a lot of soft match with the engineering review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| and the review of the right-of-way and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Are there any projects that you could foresee in the future coming up this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| that we would have to put more money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| due to costs being more than they were last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| Other than Chaud Road, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| You know, the good thing is we do our prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| and the contracts are locked in with a unit price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| So our procurement folks and our office, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| do a good job in modeling our contracts such that we limit those risks moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| And a lot of that, you know, the asphalt index is a way in which to model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| to where it's fair to the contractor, but it also protects the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Hey, Director Snowden, I want to direct your attention to the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| And in particular...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4928)|
| 1:22:08| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| A particular interest to me is Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| And I see that we've got $26 million worth of capital improvement funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Is that to complete all the way through phase four of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| Yes, that is to complete everything that is currently under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| and phase four, which is the section from Pleasant Ridge to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| So that'll put the pin in Chaud Road in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| Okay, and I see Canton Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| We have $2 million this year and $4 million next year in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Is that going to be enough to complete that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| We've actually, that project's kind of lingered a little longer than myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| or Commissioner Schoonmaker would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| We've got some utility conflicts out there that are really outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| But yes, Commissioner Smith, we have $5 or $6 million in an account now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| So we've got a few, just a very few minor right-of-way issues left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So that $6 million should fund that 100% in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| Okay, and then under bridge repair and large culvert repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| 2022 is $1 million, 2023 is $1.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| 2024 $1.5 million, and then 2025 and it continues to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| Is that projects we see in the future or is that just budget building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| It's budget building for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| All of our bridges, thankfully, are in good or fair condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| We don't have any poor rated bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| So we're really not eligible for a lot of state funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| which is good and bad because we're doing a good job maintaining our bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| so we don't get that state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| But a lot of those, what you'll see is now that we've got our bridges in good shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| we're looking at the major pipe systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| you know, your big 60-inch pipes and 48-inch pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| to go in and repair them so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| that they don't collapse or, you know, have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| And there's just, there's literally tens of thousands of those out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Are we looking at a north-south corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| four lane from Hardin Valley to Farragut yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Are we at that point yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Do we have any plans to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| We have a couple of different things we're looking at, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| We have the Campbell Station Connect corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| That both, that is in the mobility plan 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| We're working with the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| because obviously up to Black Road from the interstate is within their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| We're working with a consultant now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| that's actually doing the I-40 corridor study to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| And we've kind of chosen a preferred alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| They're going to look and kind of cost that out and give us some planning level cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| so that we can continue to press that into the mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| and hopefully into the transportation improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| And at that same consult, we're actually getting them to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Watt Road and how, because we've got two ways to get into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| And those are the two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| And we know that's going to continue to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| especially with the upcoming commercial and recreational stuff that is going on at Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| We want to be able to provide better access in and out of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| So both those projects are important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| And we're trying to secure federal and state money to try to partner with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Any other EPW questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| I can't find your number for solid waste, but I'll get it to you here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Any other department questions from any of our commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5161)|
| 1:26:01| I'm going to sort of move to the last item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| which is just open discussion about anything related to our budget that we haven't covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I have one topic that I'll open it up to the rest of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| Going once, twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Just want to gauge the, we currently have, this is our first budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| We have a workshop and a full commission meeting this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| Then we had originally put as a placeholder June 7th as the second hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| and June 14th as the third and final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| I'm not hearing or seeing any major things that are being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| We have lots of things that are still in the hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| but I'm not hearing a lot of controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| And I'm wondering what the body feels about basically moving the third to the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| We do have two other public options through our workshop or our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| So we would then have, tonight would be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| We would have workshop and commission would be second, third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| And then that June 7th would be the fourth opportunity for the public to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| And it's essentially eliminating that June 14th meeting and moving everything up one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| Is there any comment on the idea of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| I've already made schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I won't be there for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| If you do that, I've made, you're saying the vote on the 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| I'm just throwing that out as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| I'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I scheduled my time so I wouldn't miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5246)|
| 1:27:26| Given that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Maybe I can dial in on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| I don't think we're allowed to do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| And that failed in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Mr. Chairman, is there any way we can move up to public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| and then actually have this vote at our May regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I mean, we can essentially have our second hearing at the beginning of our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| and see if anybody comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| And if we have any other questions, of course, the entire staff is available at all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| and then have our third and final at the beginning of our commission meeting on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5282)|
| 1:28:12| Does anybody have any additional thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| That's one way to move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| And then we wouldn't go into June at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Anybody have any objection to that idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210510-budget-public-hearing?start=5303)|
