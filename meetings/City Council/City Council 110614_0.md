| 0:01:14| Everyone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| President, Chair, we're going to obtain a motion to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=81)|

| 0:01:26| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Item 9A and 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| If we need any discussion, maybe just a brief explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| I have a letter here from Mr. Troy Kyle who voluntarily wishes to withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Also, KCDC has made arrangements with him to purchase the property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| and also the Office of Neighborhood Development are going to help Mr. Kyle possibly locate his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| in a more advantageous location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| So I think the solution is all positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| I don't see any negative aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| I'd like to move that items 12D through Z be moved to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Vice Mayor Bateley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| I spoke to this a little earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| but I think that it's important that when we're spending the city's tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| especially at the council's will with our 202 funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| that it's important that we state that in the city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| And so what I'd like to recommend is that we not read the entire part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| but just an abbreviated version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| So I'd like to, if this motion passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I'd like to make that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| and then ask Ms. Mitchell to read an abbreviated version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I would say just without objection she'll read an abbreviated version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| so you'll know what you're adding to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Well, without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Yes, I just have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| We're going to kind of do it as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Ordinance 12E, just out of an abundance of caution, a disclosure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| And I've talked about this with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| It's $500 for James A.G. Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I do sit on the steering committee of James A.G. Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| but there's no pecuniary gain to be made in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| So it's just an abundance of caution that I'm making this disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=244)|

| 0:04:10| Well, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=250)|

| 0:04:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=257)|

| 0:13:30| that was being done at the Magnolia facility and basically to reduce some of the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=810)|
| 0:13:41| that would have occurred at the transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=821)|

| 0:16:54| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Yeah, Mayor, I was wondering if anyone could speak to, if they have any idea what we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| bring in in terms of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| What kind of, you know, how does this impact the city in a positive way, just to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| justify the expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Is anyone here from Office of Special Events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Dr. Lyons, can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Unfortunately, there's been a death in the family of special events, so they're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| This, I don't think this is a revenue on its face producing event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| People do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| It attracts a very large amount of people who obviously come into the city from surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| counties and the city, and obviously there's a little bit of spinoff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| But I think the main purpose of this event is sort of to be what it purports to be, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| is a celebration of the 4th for the citizens' enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Well, I think it's a good thing, and I just wondered if we had any figures or any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| we go about kind of calculating how that benefits us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| But no doubt, when people come into the city, they spend money, and that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| And Knoxville is sort of the cultural center for the surrounding counties, so any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| we can capitalize on a date or a holiday and bring people in, I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| I just wondered if we had any figures on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I think the sports corporation has a methodology for figuring that in terms of an event and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| how many they draw, so I'll be glad to pursue that and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Hopefully get those figures to you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| And the death in the family, I understand, was Judith Folt's father passed away, so our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| prayers are with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1112)|

| 0:19:02| No, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| I was just going to say I think that concludes our business as a council, and I think we've got a great group appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| and so we look forward to them getting together soon and ultimately down the road their findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1149)|

| 0:19:57| Knoxville City Council, Council Member Nick Pavlis, applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| I'm curious, the last report I heard was something I read in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| and I didn't know if Councilman Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| or somebody might want to bring us up to speed on what the owner's plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| or what we can look forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Well, I haven't had any conversation with the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| or anyone that represents him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| I'm not sure who really owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| but I haven't read or understood any more than what I read in the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| And I don't know, Mark, if you had any additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| I haven't had any conversation with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Well, I mean, I'll just say, I mean, this is something, obviously, that's, you know, like a cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| It's got a lot of lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| You know, it had a life early on to where thousands of people, south of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| you know, went through the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| It's obviously very important to my constituency, the south Knoxville portion of my district anyway, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1261)|
| 0:21:11| You know, it had that life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| It had a life of being empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| You know, the county, you know, had an opportunity to perhaps give it a new life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| and that went away, set empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| And now this is, I think, an opportunity for us to perhaps revive this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| It's something that could be beneficial to south Knoxville and to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| So I would just urge my colleagues to adopt this and move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Yes, I would strongly support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| I think, undoubtedly, this school has a historic aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| It's still in very good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| I think it's important that we preserve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| and find some way of keeping it in the community and making it a good asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| So I definitely support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Councilman Pavlis, this is the South High, the old South High building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| The public would know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Well, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1348)|

| 0:22:31| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| On the ordinance for reconsideration is 12C, an ordinance to amend Chapter 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Article 1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1358)|

| 0:22:47| Reconsideration requested by Councilmember Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And I'll move that we at least bring this back for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| just if nothing else for the discussion part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Being a member of the prevailing side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=1382)|

| 0:49:36| I reside at 104 Crawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| I'm here to ask for your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| in rescuing my neighborhood from the blight that is becoming ever more rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| My little neighborhood is well-established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| with the majority of homes being between 50 and 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| We have all the ingredients for a vibrant neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| We have three families with young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I'm the senior citizen representative, and then we have middle-aged folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| A family recently lost their home to a large oak tree during one of our storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| Because they feel so invested in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| they plan to rebuild at the site of their destroyed home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| They have hope for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| I live on Crawford Road, and there's a total of eight homes on this street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| plus the blighted and vacant property of a long-time, irresponsible landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| And this is our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| The building is vacant and has been for over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| and the exterior is becoming more and more shabby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| Heaven only knows what it looks like on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| Councilman Della Volpe came out last summer and walked the neighborhood with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Besides the property on Crawford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| the same landlord owns vacant properties on Tillery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| which runs parallel to Crawford and on Renwick Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| In November of 2010, there was, in the New Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| a series of articles about blighted properties and irresponsible landlords all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3083)|
| 0:51:32| Sometime after these articles appeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| the building on Crawford and one on Tillery and one on Renwick were boarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| Some of the boards on the building on Crawford have been removed and have not been replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| Even though the eight homes and yards on Crawford are well-maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| the blighted property is what stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| It has attracted vagrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| Quite often I see people walking on Crawford who are out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| Last week, a homeowner drove into her driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| realized that her home was being ransacked, called 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| and fortunately the home invader was caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Her home is right across the street from this blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| Two weeks ago, someone hauled in a terrible-looking mattress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| prompted up against a telephone pole on Crawford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| and it stayed there for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Fortunately, it was picked up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| This and other incidents are an embarrassment to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| There's a lot of vehicle traffic on Crawford, people cutting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| How many of these people think that we on Crawford do not care about the appearance of our surroundings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| We do, but we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Obviously, there is a need for some changes in both local and state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| If you can take time to review the articles that appeared in the paper on November the 28th and 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| some of the needed changes are spelled out in these articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| The POINN has done a lot of research in the problem of blighted properties and slum landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| This organization would be an excellent resource for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| You, as our local governing body, need to put pressure on our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| to make the changes that need to be made at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| You have excellent resources in your lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| I will close with this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| The owner of the blighted property on Crawford on this one piece of property owes city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| and county taxes for the years 2007 through 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| The city taxes amount to $25,467,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| and the county taxes amount to $22,765.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| This is on one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Can you imagine what an advantage it would be to city and county to be able to collect taxes, back taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| I don't know what the laws are as far as back taxes, but it looks to me like the timeframe could be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3276)|
| 0:54:47| I also feel that we need changes in our codes enforcement policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| and perhaps stricter enforcement of the present policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| So please see what you can do to help us, not only for the residents on Crawford, but for people all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Councilwoman Horati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Mr. Martin, I know that six or seven years ago when Mayor Haslam first came into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| there was a concerted effort to move our properties that were delinquent in property taxes more quickly into tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| And I know that oftentimes or sometimes that doesn't solve a blighted property problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| because the owner will come in and redeem the taxes but not address the underlying issue of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| What is the timeframe for a property such as this before it would go into the city delinquent tax sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| Councilmember Horati, I don't know the finer points of the tax sale and the number of years delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3347)|
| 0:55:56| This one is probably getting very close to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| but it has to be delinquent for a number of years before it can be put into a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Since it has not, I can only assume that it has not yet qualified for that because we have, as you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3365)|
| 0:56:16| several years ago started becoming very aggressive with that and doing what we can, what is allowed for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| And we are working likewise with the county in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| and are actually having dual sales where we work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| And certainly we're keenly aware of the issues that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| It is a balance between both the property rights of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| and also protecting neighborhoods like Mrs. Davis is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| And as I hope most of you know, we have been working with the county, the trustee's office as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| looking at both blighted and vacant properties as well as those that are tax delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| As to how we can work in concert with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| and pursue changes that we think are warranted at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| And we continue to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| And when we got organized and ready, it was hard to get it into the legislative agenda for this past session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3438)|
| 0:57:28| but we would hope to be prepared for that in the upcoming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| But it's a long process and we also need to be conscious of this is not something that's universally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| that there's universal agreement relative to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Again, I'm referring to property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| And so you have to be careful sometimes what you ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| And so we want to make sure, though, that we are at least utilizing the tools that we have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| and are operating as aggressively within the law as we can today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I know it's a balance and perhaps it would be helpful to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| if you could just send us a quick follow-up e-mail this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and let us know what the time frame looks like in terms of our pursuit of delinquent property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| I think, you know, I understand that we need to have proper notice to property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and occasionally circumstances with a family will involve extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| But certainly when a situation like this progresses for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| we need to do everything we can within the law to be fair to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| and to be fair to those property owners who do pay their taxes on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| I'd like to recognize there were some programs that were being looked into this, weren't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Our vacant properties committee continues to look into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| I would like to say my understanding is it's three years delinquent before it goes to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| And what happens often is landlords like this will pay the last year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| and get sort of caught up and, you know, then they're only delinquent a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| So it's a very difficult problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| We are looking at the state level to change the law so that title after a tax sale is clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3554)|
| 0:59:23| And this helps anybody purchasing a property through a tax sale to be able to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| The way it is now, it's very difficult to get any kind of loan on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| because the title is not clean, it's clouded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Weren't you doing a study or an inventory of not only blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| but properties that were delinquent in taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Yeah, we continue to keep that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| I mean, we are continuing to compile a list of delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| tax delinquent properties and vacant properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I wonder if Ms. Poplin can tell us if we have any ordinances on the book that allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| cite someone for maintaining a property in a blighted condition and take them to the city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| and start to get after them like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| What do we have as enforcement tools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| We have certain codes that we enforce with respect to the overgrown lots and such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| What about a vacant building that's boarded up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Those can go to our Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And I wanted to add as well, we just published notice for our next tax sale, which is coming up in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| So that notice just went out so I can get that information to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Ms. Poplin, also, what about if a property, if there's constant, you know, calls to service for KPD, you know, crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3652)|
| 1:01:04| Kind of a nuisance property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| A nuisance property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| I mean, what do we have on the books that we can do about that, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| Chief Rouse might have a better answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| I know that the police department is working with the district attorney's office on the state nuisance laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| We do have the ability to enforce the nuisance injunctions is what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| What happens is we put together a file for the DA's office and then the DA gets an injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| and then we serve those injunctions and the state then actually is the owner of the property at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| So you serve, well, okay, obviously the owner of the landlord, the owner of the property then would be the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Right, the state would serve it on the owner of the property and then the property would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| they have an opportunity to come and ask for relief or follow whatever rules are put in place by the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| But if they're unable to follow the rules, then the property becomes the property of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| And then it would go into a sale, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I mean, is this frequent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Does it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| We just started using the nuisance ordinance actually last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| We served four last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| We've done two this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| And mostly at this point it's been on criminal locations where criminal activity has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| But it is something we have talked about using, expanding our use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| You know, Memphis is the model that we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| And there are some possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| So is there, what's the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| Well, if you could maybe forward rather than belabor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| What we can do is we can get the, you know, if you all want to do a workshop on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| we can get the DA's office to come in and explain to you how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| I think it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| Oh, Caspian Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| This is well and good, but what can Ms. Davis do right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| What can we do to help Crawford Road in terms of we know that we have a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| we know that we have some properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| What do we need to do or what does she need to do to begin to remedy the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| Who does she need to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Chief Roche, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| As far as enforcement, obviously, with the issues that she mentioned of the vagrants and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| I'll take care of that as soon as we leave here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| So that will be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| But as far as the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| If I might, Chief, Mayor and Council Member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| I would suggest that both through our Office of Neighborhoods, David Massey and Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| along with Mr. King and I, I can be involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| We can certainly sit down with Ms. Davis and talk about the situation at Crawford Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| and the condition of those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I'd be delighted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| I just want to say I appreciate the city staff taking this attitude because it's wrong to let neighborhoods be dragged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3851)|
| 1:04:22| down by one or two or three groups of people that conduct activity that we shouldn't tolerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| And our duty as citizens is to protect their neighborhoods and keep their lifestyle wholesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| So I appreciate us looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| And I'd be in favor of a workshop as well after we get the information and get a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| Well, thank you, Councilman, for going on the walkthrough not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| And it's a major problem that we have, not only here but in many cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| Of course, Ms. Davis would like something done yesterday, but we're going to be working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| Put some firecrackers in the house and then call the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| If there are no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I don't want to unduly prolong this, but I would be remiss if I didn't comment on this to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| And I certainly hope council has an appreciation that the staff does take these issues very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| We try to respond to those as we know them, know about them, that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| we try to balance the matter of property rights with also trying to protect the property rights of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| and the value of their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| A lot of these laws, both particularly at the state level, do limit our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| But I hope that you know that the staff takes it very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| and works very hard to do as good a job as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Seeing no further lights, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110614?start=3960)|
