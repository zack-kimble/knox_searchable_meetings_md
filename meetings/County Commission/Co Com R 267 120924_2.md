| 4:56:08| We had another item for bookkeeping with the law department on Resolution 912 that Commission Hammond had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17768)|
| 4:56:18| The law department wants that we need to make a motion to incorporate the changes that we did today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17778)|
| 4:56:24| We need to make a motion to bring it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17784)|
| 4:56:29| Mr. Law Director, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17789)|
| 4:56:31| I'll make a motion to put it back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17791)|
| 4:56:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17793)|
| 4:56:34| First and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17794)|
| 4:56:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17795)|
| 4:56:36| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17796)|
| 4:56:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17797)|
| 4:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17798)|
| 4:56:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17799)|
| 4:56:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17800)|
| 4:56:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17801)|
| 4:56:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17802)|
| 4:56:43| Now we need a motion to incorporate the changes of the minutes into this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17803)|
| 4:56:47| I'll make a motion we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17807)|
| 4:56:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17808)|
| 4:56:49| First and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17809)|
| 4:56:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17810)|
| 4:56:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17811)|
| 4:56:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17812)|
| 4:56:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17813)|
| 4:56:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17814)|
| 4:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17815)|
| 4:56:56| Anything that was left that you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17816)|
| 4:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17819)|
| 4:57:00| And, Amy, you had one and I had one after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17820)|
| 4:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17822)|
| 4:57:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17823)|
| 4:57:04| Y'all aren't probably going to like this, but that's not ever stopped me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17824)|
| 4:57:08| I wanted to make some comments about some things that happened tonight during the course of our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17828)|
| 4:57:16| There were tonight two resolutions that passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17836)|
| 4:57:22| One was $98,000 for FluMist and one was R-12-9-803 where we designated and committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17842)|
| 4:57:31| and appropriating funds from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 for various funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17851)|
| 4:57:37| and departments that came from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17857)|
| 4:57:41| And that passed unanimously without any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17861)|
| 4:57:46| So this is what, you know, and then everything else that we brought, we got questioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17866)|
| 4:57:51| and lectures about doing stuff at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17871)|
| 4:57:55| But if the administration, what the administration brought forward didn't receive any questioning at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17875)|
| 4:58:00| and it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17880)|
| 4:58:01| Everyone voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17881)|
| 4:58:02| So this is the sort of thing that creates heartburn for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17882)|
| 4:58:09| I think that what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17889)|
| 4:58:12| And if you're going to question one person's resolution about spending on this kind of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17892)|
| 4:58:20| then everything should be questioned and voted against, if that's what you think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17900)|
| 4:58:27| But we got a lot of lectures tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17907)|
| 4:58:30| And I didn't appreciate it knowing that this had already been passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17910)|
| 4:58:35| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17915)|
| 4:58:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17916)|
| 4:58:39| Thursday night we got our legislative dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17919)|
| 4:58:42| There's going to be 36 people eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17922)|
| 4:58:45| So all of us, six school board members, the mayor's office is bringing some people, law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17925)|
| 4:58:54| So what I'd like to do is kind of be thinking about a few points you'd like to bring up to the legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17934)|
| 4:59:00| And let's have a good dinner and civil discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17940)|
| 4:59:03| but also bring your points that you want addressed or looked into over the next legislative year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17943)|
| 4:59:08| without it being a long, heated debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17948)|
| 4:59:10| I'd like for us to just have some good chatter about what's going on in the state and local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17950)|
| 4:59:15| How much time do you think you want to allow for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17955)|
| 4:59:18| Well, Representative Haynes is leaving at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17958)|
| 4:59:20| We're going to start feeding at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17960)|
| 4:59:22| So Representative Haynes needs to be somewhere at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17962)|
| 4:59:25| So we're going to probably hopefully cut everything off by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17965)|
| 4:59:28| I think we should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17968)|
| 4:59:29| I mean, we're not going to limit everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17969)|
| 4:59:30| We're going to sit down and have a little fellowship, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17970)|
| 4:59:33| But I don't want it to be a yelling or screaming match based on philosophy and principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17973)|
| 4:59:40| Let's just try to do what's right for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17980)|
| 4:59:42| It's kind of what we think of a few points to bring up is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17982)|
| 4:59:45| And reiterate that at the meeting before you start the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17985)|
| 4:59:48| Go ahead and tell him that he has to leave at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17988)|
| 4:59:49| Just remind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17989)|
| 4:59:50| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17990)|
| 4:59:51| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17991)|
| 4:59:52| And we're meeting over at Legacy Park's office at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17992)|
| 4:59:55| The food is going to start at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17995)|
| 4:59:56| The meeting is going to start at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17996)|
| 4:59:57| So if you guys can be there, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=17997)|
| 5:00:00| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18000)|
| 5:00:02| One other matter carried over from our lunch session we didn't get to was our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18002)|
| 5:00:07| Yeah, that's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18007)|
| 5:00:08| I've got that next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18008)|
| 5:00:10| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18010)|
| 5:00:12| With the IM's board, a week ahead of time, she sends out, you know, the menu today is from Joe Blow's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18012)|
| 5:00:21| Here's what you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18021)|
| 5:00:25| Friday at noon, you let us know what you want, you know, and set a price on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18025)|
| 5:00:34| and everybody kicks in whatever the cost is for whatever meal they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18034)|
| 5:00:42| Now, you know, Lunchbox does great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18042)|
| 5:00:45| There's a couple others that, you know, well, more than two or three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18045)|
| 5:00:48| There's a whole bunch of folks around here we can be eating, you know, with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18048)|
| 5:00:52| But having us a little bit more work for Jolene to have to get 11 people's lunch orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18052)|
| 5:01:01| but also, I mean, if any of the members of the press or whatever want to eat with us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18061)|
| 5:01:06| we're going to pay, they're going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18066)|
| 5:01:07| So if they want to order, they're going to have to call in an order by whatever time she says is the final deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18067)|
| 5:01:15| That works for us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18075)|
| 5:01:17| Yeah, that's one option we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18077)|
| 5:01:19| The other option is to do what we've been doing and just take a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18079)|
| 5:01:24| If each of us just took a month, if we wanted to sort of pass that around, then you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18084)|
| 5:01:29| I'm sort of in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18089)|
| 5:01:32| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18092)|
| 5:01:33| No, I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18093)|
| 5:01:34| I had something else I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18094)|
| 5:01:36| So what's your all's pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| Would you assume take a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18098)|
| 5:01:39| You want to call in every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18099)|
| 5:01:42| What do you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18102)|
| 5:01:43| I just assume if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18103)|
| 5:01:45| And whoever wants to take a month, but I, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18105)|
| 5:01:48| We pay so much a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18108)|
| 5:01:49| No, each one commissioner just buys everybody's lunch that one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18109)|
| 5:01:52| I mean, you're either going to pay $10 a month or whatever, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18112)|
| 5:01:56| I mean, either way you want to do it, but I don't care to take October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18116)|
| 5:02:01| so we can kind of keep it going and try to figure out what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18121)|
| 5:02:04| I don't care to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18124)|
| 5:02:05| I'm going to take one too, so whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18125)|
| 5:02:09| You want to do October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18129)|
| 5:02:11| I'll take October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18131)|
| 5:02:14| So, anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18134)|
| 5:02:17| So, Joe Lee, I'll get with you and we're going to Chandler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18137)|
| 5:02:22| Bell Chandler's, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18142)|
| 5:02:24| See what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18144)|
| 5:02:26| We're going to grease it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18146)|
| 5:02:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18149)|
| 5:02:30| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18150)|
| 5:02:31| I would like for us to consider buying a Keurig coffee pot for the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18151)|
| 5:02:37| It's about $80, or if we go the creme de creme, it would be $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18157)|
| 5:02:41| But I think that we have the money in our budget to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18161)|
| 5:02:44| and I don't think that it would be out of line for us to get a coffee pot for the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18164)|
| 5:02:48| And I mentioned the Keurig because we could do one cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18168)|
| 5:02:51| You don't make a bunch and throw it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18171)|
| 5:02:53| Is that the Green Mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18173)|
| 5:02:54| Yeah, that's the Green Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18174)|
| 5:02:55| We could get Green Mountain coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18175)|
| 5:02:56| It would probably give us a good deal on it, but I would just like to suggest that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18176)|
| 5:03:03| So, we have that money in our funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18183)|
| 5:03:05| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18185)|
| 5:03:06| Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18186)|
| 5:03:07| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18187)|
| 5:03:08| So, I mean, if we're all in agreement, if Jolie could go ahead and purchase one, I think it would be pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=18188)|
