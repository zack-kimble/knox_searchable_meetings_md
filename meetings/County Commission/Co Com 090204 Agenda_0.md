| 0:00:00| We're going to start our February agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| I think everyone has a copy of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=12)|
| 0:00:15| It was sent through e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=15)|
| 0:00:17| I think Joe Lee has some extra copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=17)|
| 0:00:19| You can pick one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| Do we have anything that needs to be added or deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=22)|
| 0:00:30| I'll start it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Number 14 needs to be delayed for one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=31)|
| 0:00:39| The consideration of the Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| Helen Ross McNabb will be meeting with the residents for a couple more meetings, some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| So they want to work with the neighborhood to come to a solution on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| So it will be delayed one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| I have a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| You know, some time back we appointed some members for a task force on this 10-year homeless situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=61)|
| 0:01:10| and to date nobody's called a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| So if we don't get started on it soon, you know, we're going to keep having these things pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| And, you know, before we can really decide what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Well, I need to talk to John Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| He's the one that's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| I saw him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| So that's something the commission doesn't have any jurisdiction over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| But I will say something to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Mr. Brown's on that commission task force, I believe, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| He needs to talk to Mr. Lawler about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| John Lawler, and you'll see when you're supposed to be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Oh, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Birthday girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| I'd like to add a discussion item in regards to natural resource recoveries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| In a letter I received from a citizen, I had to get with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| and be able to have a discussion in regards to testing the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| And I'll have to talk to the law director between now and the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| But I'd like to add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| I'd like to add as a discussion item to consider a task force to look at the entire problem of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| transporting the prisoners between downtown and the Maloneyville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| You know, we may have approached this a little backwards is that we need to look at the different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| and what those possibilities are to reduce that both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| And I'd also suggest that we maybe have a member of the sheriff's department, county commission, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| someone, a representative from the chief of police of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| as well as maybe even a representative of the judges to look at the whole problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| rather than just one potential solution that we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| So we may have been going about it backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| When you come up with a discussion, will you also probably have just what you just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| that you would like to have one from the commission make a special item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| May I suggest a greater use of the commission forum in these regards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| For example, Commissioner Brown, if you happen to hear from John Lawler about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I'd love to know and the forum would be a fine place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| And if that gets accomplished, the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And regarding the Vehicles Committee, Commissioners Hammond and Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I've got a sort of call out there as to what dates work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| I think that we have the commission forum for that purpose, and let's use it well for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| I'd like to add a resolution congratulating Pat's summit on her 1,000th win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| It hasn't happened yet, but I know that it will hopefully tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| And so I think that it would be appropriate for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| I'm going to be working with the Lady Vols on how to do that in an appropriate manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| so that we can either have her here at the meeting or perhaps we go to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| But I think that we as a commission, it's such a monumental event that we should go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| and put that on our agenda and be ready to recognize her when that event happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| I think you need to probably have the chairman give it to her at the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| I think so, and we're going to see if we can work that out, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| As long as the vice chairman gets to stand next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| I can't go anywhere without Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Then we all get to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Mr. Member, I have a parking spot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Do you have a van large enough to take us all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Will it hold a bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Commissioner Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| A couple of things I'd like to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| One is a Farragut High School student scored a perfect score on her ACT, Madeline Crawford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| and I think it would be appropriate to honor her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| And I'd also take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| I've talked to the law department, and they're still researching it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| but I would like to see us exempt from the Will Tax active duty military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| I think especially during this time that we ought to help those that are defending this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| and I'd like to put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| He's still researching it to see if that is something that we could do at the commission level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| but I think that's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| I think it's at least a small gesture to help out those that are in active duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| Put me down as a co-sponsor on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Mr. Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Yes, Mr. Pence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| I've got some things I'm going to propose to the mayor about cutting the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| One of them will be repealing the Will Tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| There's so many exemptions on that it's not bringing in the money that the county really needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| and the only people it's hurting are people like you're talking about in the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| and these people that work in minimum wage jobs, and right now they need this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| It may not sound like a lot of money to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| but they have to have two cars, the family does, to make it, and $72 a year is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| Well, right now I'm paying on four, and I'll probably be paying on five by the end of the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| because I've got three sons that will be driving come June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| But, you know, when you really look at it, you know, you're talking about exempting the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| you know, if your income is so low, you're exempt, school buses are exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| there's so many things exempt, we just need to eliminate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Well, that's something that we can discuss, but I wanted to at least get that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| because in case we don't do away with the Will Tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| I think it's something that we should do for those that are active in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| Does any other commissioner have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Mike, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Thank you, Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| I'd like to remove number four from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| I need your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Mike Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| No, we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| I'd like to remove number four from the agenda, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| There's some contractual issues that we're dealing with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Number four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Do you want to defer it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| One month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Number four deferred for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Regarding item number three, filling a judicial commissioner vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| will we be going directly to a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| And if so, can we put out some sort of public call for anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| I know we've had one resume since our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Could we simply have that, as we have in the past, put it to the front of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| Any questioning thereof, followed by vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and make sure that anyone who wishes to be added to the list can be added in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| Well, this was put on just in case we need to decide what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| That's the reason I wanted you to be here today, to discuss what we will do since we got the letter from the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=489)|
| 0:08:19| Andy Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| It's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| I would think that's a reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| It was put on there just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| I'm the one who put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I would think that would be a reasonable way to proceed, make public announcement that we'll take additional resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| that we will vote again at the next meeting and include the past resumes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| and question and vote in the normal procedure we've used in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Well, that's the reason I wanted to have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Do we want to open it up to more resumes or do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| If you want to take the vote before then, you know, my idea was to not open it up because everyone had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=533)|
| 0:09:04| That's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| But it's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| And then probably the only time that we can get everyone together would be at a commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| and vote on it like we always do at the beginning and go for it, have them sworn in, and it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| But it's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| In regards to that, I was kind of, I have been thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| My hope was that since we received some of the resumes after the deadline last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| and there was such a, to put it mildly, a confusion about the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| I would like to propose taking one of the former commissioners that were voted, not voted in, reappointed, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| and making them a commissioner until we reappoint in June and have a better, more thought-out process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| and fill three seats instead of two seats in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| Make him a what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Make an appointment of one of the two former commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I just extended them for six months until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And then instead of filling two seats in June, fill three seats in June with a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| Can we do that legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| We can do whatever we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Mr. Chairman, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| We can select someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| Do you weigh in on this since we did have an election process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| To extend one of the former commissioners six months and then instead of voting in two more commissioners in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| vote in the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Extend one of the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| The term that was left vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Expired, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| You can't extend it because it's previously expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| But you can, by resolution, you know, can be changed to accommodate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=655)|
| 0:11:07| that you debate and vote on as long as it doesn't violate the ordinance or the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| You have a lot of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| What we had hoped to accomplish, I think Commissioner Norman had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| and I had mentioned last time, too, is the Intergovernmental Committee was going to come up with a proposal to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| before commission about restructuring this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| Now there's this more pressing matter of a fifth commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| So, you know, really, I don't think there's anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I wasn't prepared to answer this question in terms of whether it violates the ordinance or state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| but I think that if you want to go ahead and change and say by resolution that this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=724)|
| 0:12:18| this one vacancy will go through June, that you have the power to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| and it doesn't violate any other ordinance resolution or state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| Bill, even though we had an election and we were trying to elect three people, it doesn't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| What you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I don't think that it would affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| But, again, I would like the opportunity to look and I can reply by memo to the entire body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=764)|
| 0:12:56| and let you know if that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Well, this would give us more time to work through what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| and Commissioner Norman had talked about as far as restructuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| If we did this, it would give us until June to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| Mr. Chairman, this is another proposal I've got in the budget outline there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| It probably won't get off the floor, but I've talked to Joe there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| I tried to get along with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I don't think these judicial commissions are mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| I'm going to propose cutting two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| That saves the county approximately $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| The courts rotate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Let one court come in 1 p.m. to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| That would be a citation court and it bonded arraignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| and the judge would be available to see the officers and the public during this court schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| And that would lengthen no judge's time either, but it would save Knox County $160,000 approximately a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| That would be a proposal that I'm also going to send to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| I think Mr. Anders has an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| I think we've got a lot of different options on the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| I think at the very least this was a, you know, I don't like the way how this process was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| You know, this is a commission appointment and, you know, they're supposed to confirm, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| if we send them qualified candidates, they're supposed to confirm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| They have the power to not ratify just as a fail safe of if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| if we send them someone who's not a lawyer, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| And I think that we sent them three excellent, well-qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| And I think that they've got their own ideas about who they would like on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| And I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| If we want to make this a session's judge appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| if they want to make the appointment, you know, I don't really have a problem like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| I said, you know, what I have a problem with is that through this ratifying process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| they turned down and embarrassed probably the most qualified candidate we sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| And I swear the only reason I can imagine that they would have turned him down is that they had a preference as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| who they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| And if they want to start making this appointment, I think that we need to change the process to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| they make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And I could make a strong case for that, you know, sessions judges, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| could be able to make this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I could really defend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| But I think that what we need to do right now is that we need to do like Mr. Anders suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| We need to extend one of these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| And then that will give us a few months to cool down and come up with a new process that will be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| It will also give us the opportunity to examine what Mr. Pinkston is going to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| So I think that it is within our best interest that we simply extend things as they are to give us time to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=960)|
| 0:16:10| if we need as many judicial commissioners as we have, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| and decide if this should be a commission appointment or if maybe it should be a judicial appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| So I'm going to be supporting Mr. Anders' proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| I would have to respectfully disagree with Commissioners Anders and Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| We have a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| We had a great applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Several of us took great pains to praise the applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| So I think we simply should revisit those who have applied and find a good candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| and send that candidate forward, as the chairman suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| I think that's the most reasonable way to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| We don't need to create a new interval and try to create a 2-3 rather than a 3-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| And if we want to change something in the future, let us by all means do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| But there's no need to change our schedule of doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| We have a great pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1030)|
| 0:17:10| Let's select from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I tend to agree with Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| I see a couple of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| I see some advantages to Mr. Anders' proposal, but one would be we've already essentially rejected these two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1042)|
| 0:17:32| And if they've been rejected in this position, I don't know how you would feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| but if I would feel, I wouldn't want anybody coming back to me and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| I would like for you to substitute back in for six months or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| I'm making other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| I'm going someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| And so I think that's unfair to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| I don't think anybody, I don't know if anybody's contacted these two rejected commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| if that would be amenable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| But I just think it's a step backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| I would be in favor of, as Mr. Harmon said, we had an extremely qualified pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| I wouldn't be for extending that qualified pool even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| That just is going to increase the problem of selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| So we've got plenty of people to select from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| I would be in favor of going right ahead with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I don't think that's fair to these people that have already been rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| I'm all in favor of going on ahead with the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| However, I would agree with Commissioner Lambert in that it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to select somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| send it to the judges, and then come back and say, well, we're rejecting this candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| because we've gone through the process of vetting these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| So I would like to hear from the judges on what they think would be a better process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| because if they have the ultimate yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| I would hate to have someone again come in and let's bring them forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| and then all of a sudden the judges come in and say, well, we're not going to accept this one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| It seems to me that they should get involved on the front end, look at these applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| and if there's an issue, perhaps they can very quietly go to this individual and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| we've got a problem here, rather than going into the public process, because I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| there was no reason for this individual to be on the front page of the paper being rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| I feel like that wasn't fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| and I feel like that the judges need to work with us on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| And if they want the appointment, then let's talk about giving them the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| If they want us to do the appointment, they need to get more involved with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| because if there is an issue with a candidate or if there's some kind of issue out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| for example, with Mr. Brown, we need to know on the front end rather than on the back end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| and all of a sudden we get into this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| As a side note, Mr. Chairman, I noticed that the city council last night spent about two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| debating on how they were going to fill their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| All they need to do is just kind of do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I mean, it seems to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| So I just say that in case someone from the city is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I'm from the city, and they did spend two hours, and they ended up doing exactly what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| They've learned some lessons from us, but it was the wrong lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| I've talked to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| We've had a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| And I know I have to be very, very careful in what I send to the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| but I was also in agreement with you that I wanted my first thought was to send them a letter and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| well, you tell us, you know, who you don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| But I know you have to be very, very careful in what you send to a judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| and what they can say back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| So I'm in total agreement that they need to let us know so we don't go down this path again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| and pick someone and then they say we don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| So carefully, we need to find a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| So none of us will get in any trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| I got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| I agree with what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| An invitation was extended to the session court judges to participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| They declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| They knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| They had a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| They could have had all the resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| They could have come to any of us and quietly said, hey, this person is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1279)|
| 0:21:29| If you send us this person, we're going to reject them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| They didn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I don't guess that they told any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| You know, we set this up, this process up the beginning of January, and we did it here at the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| They had plenty of time to let it be known to commissioners that this particular individual was not acceptable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1308)|
| 0:21:57| And they declined to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| They were originally going to be a part of the judicial committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| They declined to be a part of that because they did not want to be subject to the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| They wanted to be able to go down to their chambers in their back room and vote amongst themselves to reject an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1333)|
| 0:22:22| They didn't want to be a part of the public transparent process that we did because they're not subject to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| And they didn't want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| And how we get beyond this, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| But I do agree we should go ahead and move forward with the applicants that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| But I do have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Some of the applicants have, like you've suggested, have moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| They've taken other jobs, and they may not want to be an applicant anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| So I do think we need to put it back out there to at least the ones that have applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| and have them contact us to make sure that they still wish to be an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1386)|
| 0:23:15| Do we have any more suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| You didn't make that in the form of a motion, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| If you'll make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| If someone wants to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| I can't see whose light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I only see yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| It's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| I spoke with one of the judges this morning for about an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| and got a lot of good insight into what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| And I wish that they had come and spoke to the entire commission about what it is they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| It might have made it easier for us when we were making these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| And like I said, I felt like it was flawed when we were working on it during our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| And I still feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| But I am more comfortable after speaking to that one judge, more confident in what they're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| and more confident in my ability to nominate someone that I think would do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| and be who they were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| So I would like to go ahead and proceed and get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| And we're going to have to do it again in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| You know, we need for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So that gives us six months to come up with a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| But my understanding also is that Donna, I believe her name is Donna, the judge's secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| is contacting all of these people to see if they still wish to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| So somebody's already moving on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| We need to get that to the commission office one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| whether it comes from the individual applicants or from Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| But I think the office needs to be contacted so that we know for sure that they are interested in this position still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| And it may still be the two previous commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| They may still be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| But they need to be contacted as to whether or not they still wish to be so that we can proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| I know one of them is because I was contacted by one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Well, in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| That might be a compromise position between Mr. Anders that opened it back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| request those two that weren't selected to be included in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Well, they were applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I mean, so they would be an applicant just like any of the others and would still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| They would still be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Oh, they were an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I don't even know who were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| But the process, the process, we're stuck with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| I mean, we could do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| We could embarrass the next selection just as we have Mr. Creekmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| We're stuck with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| So that's to be addressed after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Well, you know, the other thing these judges could have done is that they could have approached that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| and said to them, you know, you might want to reconsider your application because you're not going to be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| and let that applicant have a chance to quietly withdraw their name and not have to be embarrassed the way they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1582)|
| 0:26:33| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Yeah, I still agree with Mr. Anders' proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I think that we need to redo the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| You know, from what I've heard, and I know you can't base a lot of things on courthouse rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| but from what I've heard that this was not about who, it was not about any of the candidates that we sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| that it was about the candidates that we didn't send, that they had a clear preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| and that they had actually told someone that they were going to help them get the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| and then they failed to do what they told them they would do, and that's lobby for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| And I hear that, like I said, that they didn't have a problem at all with the candidates that we sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| And I understand if they want to make the appointment, they need to take this over and make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| What I don't think we should do, I don't think we should rush through and reappoint with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| I think that what we need to do, we need to put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| We need to say this stunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| The most qualified candidate that we sent them was rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| And it wasn't because of a problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| It was because those judges had a preference for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| I have no problem with judges making this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| But if they're going to make this appointment, they need to make this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| and not hem-haul around about it the way they did and embarrass probably one of the finest folks to ever serve this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| And so I think that what we need to do, we need to put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| We need to do what Mr. Anders has suggested, and we need to put a temporary person in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| And then that's going to give us time to create a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| You know, I think that to move forward, I mean, you know, I understand, yeah, if we pull the two out of that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| you know, it limits the pool of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And if these judges have a preference, they need to tell us what that preference is and not do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| well, we're going to limit the pool to give our guys an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| They need to tell us who they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| And if they want this appointment process, they need to take it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| But for right now, I think we need to put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| We need to devise a new process, and I think that that's the way we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| And if Mr. Anders will make his motion, make his proposal as a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| And I think that that's the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| We don't have to be in a hurry to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| You know, whenever people say, well, we need to hurry up and get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| that's when I get real worried because somebody's trying to ramrod something through on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| If we do what Mr. Anders has suggested, it allows us to put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| It allows us to come up with a completely new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And if there's folks here that the judges had lobbied for a certain candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| I think they need to come forward and say, the judges have lobbied for this candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| so the rest of us know what they're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| But none of the judges have called me, and judges are not bound by the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| They're not a part of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| They can give any one of us a call and lobby for the candidate of their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| What happened is they failed to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| and one of the finest public servants to ever serve this county was embarrassed for absolutely no reason at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| He was the most qualified candidate that they were sent, and they had no reason to reject him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| except that they have another idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| And so I think we need to put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| We need to change this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| And if they want to start appointing folks to positions, they need to step up and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| and quit this back room behind their closed doors shenanigans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Right now is not the appropriate time to make a motion and a second to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| What we simply have here is we're setting our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and we can change even on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| When do we meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| The 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| The 23rd of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| We can change what we have on the agenda to match whatever motion Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| or any other commissioner wishes to make at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| We can appoint someone for, say, a four or five or six-month term at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| We don't necessarily need to do that at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And we can always discuss this again, the merits of moving forward or not moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| or something like that, at our committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| So this simply just puts it on the meeting for February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| and then we can make those decisions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Maybe we'll hear from the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| The reason I brought up the two previous commissioners that weren't reappointed were twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| One is they've already been picked by the judges at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| so it's kind of hard to reject them the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And number two, give the office down there a little bit of continuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| until we can figure out exactly how we move forward on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I have no choice as to who one of those two are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| Personally, I know one better than the other, but it just gives continuity to the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| and it also allows us to send someone to the judges who they haven't rejected before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| and have obviously approved of before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| And so I'm not trying to limit the pool by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| but to band-aid the process and stop the county from or stop the judicial commissioner's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| from filling and finding substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Some commissioners now are working two shifts, and we're paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And so my opinion, as we move forward on the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| something to consider is taking one of the two that were not reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| If they're still interested, I don't know that they are or they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| just based on continuity until June the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| And then hopefully by that time we'll have this process remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| That's the only reason I propose those two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I'd just like to make one thing a little clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| I've heard today that we have, quote, rejected two prior commissioners in our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| Our process rejected every applicant that wasn't appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| So I would hope for us to think for a moment that two fine individuals who have applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| for this particular position have theoretically been pre-rejected before they have a chance this second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| Everyone who wasn't appointed was rejected in our immediate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| And I think intellectually we need to come back with a clean slate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| and accept every applicant that is available for us to, you know, with a true open eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| accept every applicant that comes forward for this second process however we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| I think we'll be misguided to come in with the idea that some of them have already been rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and some of them haven't when this is a new applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Commissioner Norman, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Yes, and to that, Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| that's the reason why I think the two that were not selected by us should be included in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2058)|
| 0:34:27| And I'd be fine with that, but we need to make some kind of contact with them and let them know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| And, indeed, though, I think, as you just stated, they were rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| They had the job and they were not deemed acceptable by us because we did not choose them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| The other folks did not have the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| And so there's a little bit different level of accountability here, responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| So I'm especially sensitive to those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And, therefore, I hope they are included in the process and can be possible choices for the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2098)|
| 0:35:08| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I don't have a problem with opening it up to all brand new applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| The only problem that I can foresee by doing that is I think we start the whole process of having to do the interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| process again because if we're going to open it up to whoever wishes to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| then I think we have to go back through that open meeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| and letting them state their case as to why they feel that they are the best applicant for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| If we limit it to those that were on our list last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| then I don't know that we necessarily need to go back through that unless this commission wishes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| And, you know, it's up to this commission to decide how they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| So that's just my opinion on if we want to open it up to whomever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| or keep it limited to those who were on the list last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And I don't have a problem either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I think, though, at the end of nominations at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| the call from the chair was would anyone be nominated from the podium so that we could have nominations anew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2178)|
| 0:36:29| from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| So I believe we're going to get nominations that we may not have seen before as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2190)|
| 0:36:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Just one point of observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| We're talking about appointing someone for a six-month job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| It doesn't seem to me that it would make sense for someone who has not been in that position before to leave a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| to take a new position than you was only going to be for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Unless they're betting on the come, they're going to get reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| The position is for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Well, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Is it four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| But we're still back on the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| It's never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| The six-month deal here for the band-aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| That was just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| But the position is for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| The point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| The call for public input is appropriate and it's called for under the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2249)|
| 0:37:38| But while members of the public can come to the lectern and suggest other candidates, they cannot nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2258)|
| 0:37:48| Only members of this body can nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| I think that we should go through the interview process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| There were a lot of commissioners who weren't at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| and they're going to be expected to appoint someone to this position for the next three years or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| or whichever it turned out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I think that we need to go through that process again to give the commissioners who were not here an opportunity to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| and ask questions and hear the candidates speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I'll give you a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| I'm open for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Mr. Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I just want to say that I was one of those that was not able to be here on the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| but that's okay because I intend to talk with all of the people who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| But these judicial commissioners, you know, they can deny you bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| They can issue arrest warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| I mean, this is a very, very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| They can take away your rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| And I think that we as a body need to be able to go through the vetting process once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| If we're going to have new applicants, then let's take the time, meet with them, let them come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| give their qualifications, and then just start anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Just go through the process anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| And this way I think that it's a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Those that don't want to do it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| If they want to, they can reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| But also I think that somehow maybe our law director meets with the judges since you talk their language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| and say is there a way that we can avoid the type of thing that happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| If there is an issue, somehow we need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| But, again, I would just be in favor of starting the process anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| And let's have the public hearing and just go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| When we first opened up these resumes, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| we had a deadline on when people were supposed to submit their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| We still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Let me finish talking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| I think I talk pretty good myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| A lot of people don't like what I say, but I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| But what I was going to say is we took those resumes to appoint three judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| Why can we not just keep the same ones that applied in this group because we haven't appointed one yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| And cut it off to that just like it was because that was what we started out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| We took them to appoint four judicial commissioners and we've only appointed two, I mean three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| And we've only appointed two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| So why couldn't we not just hold it close to that and go ahead with this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| I don't think there's anything to prevent you from doing that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| If a majority of the body thinks that's the way you should proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| Well, if anybody else had been interested in these jobs, they should have gotten their resumes in at the cutoff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| So I would like to, if we can't make a motion here, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| But I would like to say that we just hold it to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Everybody that was turned down is still in the running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| And if they want to make a better case of presenting themselves to me and you, they need to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| And we go right ahead at the next commission meeting and appoint one of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| I will phrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| I was going to phrase that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I move that we have a, that we act on this at the next commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| that we use the existing pool of applicants and that the commission office confirm through any means necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| the remaining interest of that pool of applicants, and that we make a choice at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| After 30 minutes, that was my original idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2509)|
| 0:41:58| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| I was going to make the same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| After 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| We got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| You've got to steer us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| I sleep when you say the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Now, the motion needs to be to put it on the agenda that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| because all we can do at this meeting is set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Put it on the agenda in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| It's on the agenda, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| To appoint a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| It's on agenda number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| It's on number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| And to make it clear that item number three will occur at the beginning of the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| and that the commission office in the interim will determine the remaining interest of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| And the pool of applicants is limited to those that met the last cutoff date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| And the other thing, is it proper that the bill that you can talk to the judges to see if the other eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| or nine or however many it was is okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| I think there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| So we don't have to go through this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I don't think there's anything improper in that, but I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Or should I do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Well, I think perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I'd love to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Well, then, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| I think that's the way it should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| I was going to suggest, and there's nothing to prevent you from doing it, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| since the last communication to this body, official communication, was Judge Jackson's letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2596)|
| 0:43:30| I don't see that there would be anything wrong in a letter going back asking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| if there are any objections to any of the pool that you're talking about and requesting that they respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2618)|
| 0:43:49| And if they respond that any of those candidates would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| The only problem I can foresee is if they do have a problem with one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and then that person is going to be publicly embarrassed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and they may not have ever had a chance to receive the nomination from us to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| They can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Not well, they can withdraw, but you're going to have a formal letter stating these are acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Oh, by the way, this name wasn't mentioned, which would mean that they're not acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| publicly embarrassing someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And I wish they had come to us before and said, hey, these individuals are not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| They could have come to each and every one of us and said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| And they declined when they were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| Well, we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Maybe we need to, with the invitation to submit your application for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| we say you may be subject to public embarrassment and rejection of your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| I agree that the process has to go forward as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Some of us on the subcommittee surveyed the judges before, and we asked them, were there anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2704)|
| 0:45:12| were there any applicants that are unacceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| There were none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Let's send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Mr. Norman, let's send it like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| These people, I feel like if there's anything there in their background now that they'll withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| since they know they're going to be subject to this humiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| So they'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Let's just send it like we were talking about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And, you know, if I've got something, a skeleton or two in my closet, I'd get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| Well, now, I just want to reiterate that there was nothing wrong with the applicant that wasn't chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| The rumor I'm hearing is that they've used the excuse of they questioned whether he had computer skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| I can certainly attest that Mr. Creekmore does have computer skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| This is not about the applicant that was rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| It was that these judges had a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Instead of coming forward and lobbying in the light of day about who their choice was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| they chose to use their ability to confirm to try to get their choices a second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2773)|
| 0:46:22| There was not a skeleton in anybody's closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| You know, the stuff that was in the new Sentinel was 25 years, almost 25 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| and it was a very partisan sheriff that went after every Republican in this courthouse at one point or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| and was eventually rejected by the voters in favor of Tim Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| So, I mean, I don't think there's anything in any of these applicants' closets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| I don't think that there's any problem with the applicant that we sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| The bottom line is, is these judges want to make the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| but they don't have the guts to stand up and tell us who they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And they need to get up and tell us who they want so that we don't embarrass somebody else again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| I just think we need to start the process anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| I'll vote no, too, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| With two noes, the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| I'd like for the, we have a resignation on the BVA, Bud Armstrong, Commissioner Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2854)|
| 0:47:43| Beer Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Beer Boyd, Beer Boyd, Beer Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| And this is due to the lawsuit from, what's his name, Herb Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2866)|
| 0:47:55| Do you want to weigh in on that, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2875)|
| 0:48:07| I don't want to publicly comment on the pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| I will say that there is some legislation that was passed during the last session of the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2894)|
| 0:48:25| that impacts commissioners who serve on committees, commissions, and it was a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2905)|
| 0:48:39| And we are looking at that and are going to be sending a memo out to all of you regarding our interpretation of that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2919)|
| 0:48:54| And I think most of you knew that we were already looking at issues regarding the BVA, and it's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2934)|
| 0:49:05| And we decided to expand our research to look at all boards and committees that commissioners could potentially serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2945)|
| 0:49:21| or if it specifically says by resolution or ordinance that commissioners will constitute part of the membership of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2961)|
| 0:49:32| because that new legislation does impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| So we'll have something coming to you shortly on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| I want to honor Commissioner Armstrong's letter because of him being an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2982)|
| 0:49:50| He's under different whatever the word I want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| But anyway, I accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| There's a couple of housecleaning things that we need to take care of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| First, I think we need to formally put Michelle Carringer, Commissioner Carringer, on intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| And I'm not sure what the exact process needs to be done, if that's just a chairmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| The chairman can do that on his own or if that needs to be a vote of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I think it needs to be a vote of this commission since the committee on committees is the one that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| We definitely need to be out in the open on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| You want to make a formal motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| If we can, if it's acceptable to do that, I'll make a motion that we place Commissioner Carringer on intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| Is that acceptable since we're here just to meet to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| That's why I'm going to ask the law director about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| The other item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| We can expand the rules, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| We don't have any regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| We made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| The other item, the house cleaning item, we need to do, and I don't know if we do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| we want to do it at intergovernmental, but we do need to elect a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| And if the vice chair becomes the chair, then we would need to elect a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| So we need those items taken care of at this month's intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| I need to make sure that those are on the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| We can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| As far as placing Commissioner Carringer on intergovernmental, does this body need to take any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| or what action should we take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Because normally it's committee on committees that places and then this commission would accept that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| How would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Well, you know, the way we did it last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| and there is a process in your rules now that was adopted on how committee assignments are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3110)|
| 0:52:00| and it's appropriate that the chairman convene a meeting of the committee on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| and that that committee then make the assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| Can they do that today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Mr. Chairman, would you like to convene a committee on committees to make that assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| Sure would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Your point, a couple of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| If I'm not mistaken, Scott Moore was committee on committee chairman last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| Commissioner Luthor, would you like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| I'll be happy to serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| Commissioner Armstrong, do you want to be on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Do you want me to chair it real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Commissioner Armstrong, Commissioner Browse, Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| Do we have five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Commissioner Saunders and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Do you want to be on the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I was on it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| The five of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| And don't go away from this microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Would you like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Do I hear any motions from the committee on committees as to intergovernmental appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| I'll make a motion that we appoint Commissioner Carringer to the intergovernmental committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. Chairman, committee on committees reports back that we have placed Michelle Carringer on intergovernmental committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3210)|
| 0:53:42| I accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| The way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Now, the other with the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| I'm going to recommend that you hold off on making any appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| So granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| I was just going to make a motion for David Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| If he's out of the eighth district, we need somebody in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| But what's going to happen next month, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| He just said that he asked me to hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| So you'll serve and Bud, you'll serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Would this be vacant that month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Can Mr. Wright fill in, Bill, while we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| I'm going to recommend that no commissioners be reappointed to any vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| And as I said a moment ago, you'll be hearing from my office very shortly with some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| and an explanation of what we think the law says about commissioners serving on other governmental bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3287)|
| 0:54:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Mr. Wright, if anything comes up in your district for a beer board, if you want to come and just speak on behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| We'll welcome your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Is there anything else come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Seeing none, meeting's adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| I appreciate everyone coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090204agenda?start=3316)|
