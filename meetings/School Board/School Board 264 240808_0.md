| 0:07:30| Some are quickly forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=450)|

| 0:10:45| And let me just quickly say, Susan, we began our political careers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| Most people don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| You ran my first campaign, which we lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| You helped run my second campaign, which we did win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| And then the Lord called you into service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| And so speaking on behalf of our family, most of you probably know Susan and I are related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| we are extremely proud of you, thankful for the service that you have given to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=669)|

| 0:11:12| You will be missed, and you have left a legacy that is going to be very difficult to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| So with that, Madam Chair, thank you for giving me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I have this great framed proclamation, and if we could, is there somebody here to snap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Can somebody do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=682)|

| 0:11:26| We can snap a quick picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| We always love a good picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=688)|

| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=690)|

| 0:11:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| That was very sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| And Susan, your friend and Vice Mayor of Farragut, Louise Pavlin, also reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=711)|
| 0:12:07| to me this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=727)|

| 0:12:13| Farragut, so she did send me a statement she wanted me to read to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I want to thank Susan Horn for her eight years of service on the Knox County School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Board of Education representing the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| I was fortunate to meet Susan and call her my friend long before she and I decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| run for office representing the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Previous to serving as an elected official, Susan had served the Farragut schools as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| volunteer and had established the relationships with parents and staff that gave her a solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| foundation to effectively advocate for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Susan was well prepared when she began her service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Earning a seat on the Knox County School Boards of Education comes with some resources, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| computer, access to highly educated and professional staff, your own official email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| What it doesn't come with is a crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| No one could have anticipated the difficulties that COVID would inflict on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Susan handled this difficult time with grace and a steadfast commitment to the well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I am beyond grateful that I had a good friend serving on the Board of Education while I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| served on Farragut's Board of Mayor and Aldermen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Anytime I had questions or concerns about our schools, I could pick up the phone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| know that we could have an honest conversation about steps forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| More importantly, I had a friend who could provide wise counsel and someone I could commiserate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Being an elected official can be a lonely and stressful experience at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Having friends who understand that is invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Congratulations, Susan, on a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| You represented your community committedly and admirably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| Enjoy your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Thank you so much for reading that and thank you Representative Zachary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| I always forget to say representative because I've known him since he was in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you so much for this great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=842)|

| 0:14:14| I am grateful to have been able to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=854)|

| 0:14:21| that we provide the best education that we can for students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| I'm excited about where the school system is going under Dr. Reiswick's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| I'll be cheering you all on from a distance and won't be far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| Just as I've been a sounding board for Louise all these years, now we can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Now you all can call me if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=885)|

| 0:14:47| Thank you for all your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| Mr. Watson and Ms. Owen, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| I'm not trying to put pressure on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It would feel weird not to now, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| I felt like I shared my comments the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=904)|

| 0:15:16| A lot of that is because of my work here and believing that we need to continue to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| forward for our kids and the earlier we do it, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=920)|

| 0:15:38| There's a lot of noise out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| We need to kind of wrestle that out of our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=939)|

| 0:27:48| They were hoping after our discussion when we first brought this up that there would be some time for teachers to have some additional planning and collaboration in planning with their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1668)|
| 0:28:01| And those things don't seem to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| So I think that's part of the reason that we saw such a large swath of the respondents saying that they supported the days but with changes because they would very much like to have changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1683)|
| 0:28:18| Having more time in meetings to talk about things that may not be very relevant to their classes isn't helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1698)|
| 0:28:31| And they really need that time for planning that they are not getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I have heard from a few people who are in favor of these days going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| However, I appreciated the presentation from Monday night so that we could see the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| I'm thankful that a lot of people did respond so that we could see how a lot of people feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| So I'm also interested to see what other folks have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| I thought that it made sense to look at, if we were going to look at getting rid of any of them, the August and January days because they do provide such a disruption so early in the school year and then when we also have that day off in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1748)|
| 0:29:22| So that just, I think, I was thinking ahead to I can just hear it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Why are we out of school when we, you know, all of those conversations because we always hear those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| So I think just in a practical sense that that makes sense to adjust those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| So I was kind of interested in other board members' feelings on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And also I do know, obviously, that principals are planning these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| And so, you know, what kind of hardship that is going to create for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| But it seemed like that might be a compromise to take those, to do that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| So anyway, I'm interested to see what other people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Dr. Wilson, I know the presentation the other night I think was very helpful and I appreciated all the data that was gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| And I think it was telling that the least, the approach that people like the least is the one that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| I mean, and that was, you know, across all three sectors that were polled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Was the, I know it's not on the board agenda as a recommendation from the staff, but is there a recommendation from the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| I mean, did you all look at that data and say, oh, we really do need to change something because this polled so poorly in terms of how we currently do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| Yeah. So, I mean, I think what I brought the other night, I would say, and I think Ms. Horn just used that word as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| I felt like it was a good compromise in terms of what we saw in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| What, honestly, anecdotally, we had heard over the last couple of years to recognize some opportunity for some structured individual planning time where teachers could have some of that as an add back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1857)|
| 0:31:09| I recognize what Ms. Horn labeled in the calendar and in terms of those days that are really early in the semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| So what we brought certainly was, I think, trying to be attentive to what we were hearing, but then also be true to the spirit of where the original request we felt like came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| And and to honor the fact that, you know, our principals have already developed their plans for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| And while it would be an adjustment to move to a four half day schedule, it's a minor adjustment in comparison to either canceling those or moving to like a full two day schedule or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| Would we be fine with leaving it the way it is? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I think we we again feel like that was the original model developed, which we have had about a year and a half of trying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| And so we feel like there's probably still work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| We talked about, you know, some of it is the devil's in the details a bit in terms of like what each each person experiences with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| I think when you think about the school planning and all that, we've tried to lean into support and and helping in developing those PD plans through our regional teams and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| But certainly haven't gotten that perfect everywhere. But again, what we brought the other night, I think I felt like was a good compromise that sort of honored lots of different perspectives on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1929)|
| 0:32:19| Yeah. Thank you. I mean, as you all pointed out the other night, it was intended to be originally as a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| And you would expect to study any pilot, which is what you all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| And so I think I might disagree with you in the sense of I think it's fine to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I don't think we should leave it to what it is when we claimed it was a pilot and we studied it and people were saying we should change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| I'm not going to arm wrestle you over it, but I mean, I just I think we probably need to learn from the data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| And so I would be in favor of changing it to either of the two other options that that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| And Miss Bike, I really I in my view, I think it's I would look to your leadership to make a motion on that because it was the issue that you brought up and I would be supportive of either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1971)|
| 0:33:02| I did indicate the other night that I thought it I thought the data was telling in the sense of we're choosing the option that seemed to be least attractive to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1982)|
| 0:33:12| Although I know we can't we haven't been able to dig into all the data to know, you know, where is the same parents answering all three of those questions the same way and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| I get that. I do think either option is probably better from from the data that we were given than what we currently are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| So one more thing. I do think it's important to know that the first one is coming up August 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| But I think to take something away is easier than to say we're adding something on the 16th and now you got to plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| So, yes, I think there will be some disruption to what principals and administrators and teachers have already kind of planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| But it's much easier to say we're not going to do something then. Oh, now you've got to figure out how to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| So I think they can I think that's you can adjust to that more quickly than adding something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| Reverend Butler. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I also want to thank you for the data and the work that was going to go into presenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2040)|
| 0:34:11| I think that parents, as it was said, find the half days difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| I think that the half days also could be a factor in absenteeism being a little bit higher on those days, as well as about a quarter of I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2057)|
| 0:34:31| was staff favored the half days and then another little bit more than a quarter said they favor them with changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| But there was still a great deal that didn't like the half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| So after looking at the data and listening to the initial outcries from parents, I think I support I would support the four days more than the half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2082)|
| 0:34:55| However, it's not that much of a favoring. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you. Miss Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I realize we're looking at a difference in days and what I'm talking about is a little bit different from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| But I'd like the board just to consider for a minute the amount of time that it takes you to prepare a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| How long does it take you to prepare a one hour presentation that is specific to the people in the room and differentiated for everyone in that room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2117)|
| 0:35:27| Take that amount of time and our teachers are doing that six and a half hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| But state law requires that we give them 30 minutes of plan for that six and a half hours of instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| Many of our teachers only have that 30 minutes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Any kind of plan time that we can give them is not a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| It's absolutely necessary. So please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you. I heard from a couple of parents, too, who are in favor of the half days just because it's it's it's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2154)|
| 0:36:05| And I think it's pretty coherent with what is what we have now. So I do think it's a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| So I would be in favor of the half days. And I know as a parent myself, I've said it for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| Like because there are two different times, you know, noon and then one thirty one day when I forget one of my kids with those two different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| But so I would be in favor of and from the parents that I've heard, I would be in favor of changing it to the four half days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2184)|
| 0:36:34| It's like, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Duvall, I'm not sure if this is even possible, if we can vote on something that would affect the future calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| But I think if we believe we should move toward two full days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| I think the motion could be to adjust the current calendar to four half days and then the next calendar would represent two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| I think I think it is more of an adjustment to leap from what we currently have to two full days this current year since the calendar has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| But if we feel like we should move in that direction, I mean, can we state that now and make that a part of the calendar for the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2225)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. Regarding that point, Mr. Watson, I think certainly it would be cleaner to have two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2237)|
| 0:37:28| I think my question would be whether it would be more advantageous to the staff to have four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| So that would be my question on that. I think that's I mean, again, I'm not everybody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| but I think that's probably why on the data we saw that that was the perspective of teachers and administrators over parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| Parents, by and large, wanted the two full days. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Parent staff wanted the two, the four half days. And I think the reason why I totally get it is because you spread out that time over more days over the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| So you don't have to front load all that in one day. I totally get it from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| And I think I'm just on this particular issue, just leaning toward the parents more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| So I think I would prefer that we wait and not make that decision now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I think it would be better to let the staff go back to two principals and talk through again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| OK, if this is the amount of time you have, you know, could you accomplish something better in two days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Because I think we need to make sure we're remembering that the point of it is to make sure that we are doing two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| providing planned time and what professional development teachers need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| But also the end goal is to make sure we're we're affecting the students in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| And we need to make sure that we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And so it may be better to wait on that for the following school year until we have a little bit more information from what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| Although I totally agree that it needs to be done quite a lot earlier than August, 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| But I think we could probably, you know, hopefully that determination could be made, you know, in the early January, February time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2337)|
| 0:39:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| Where is the if we are so we're looking at this year and then next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| is this something where we can change this year and come back in January or February to see how this has worked and reassess then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2359)|
| 0:39:31| And how disruptive would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So that's actually Corey and I were sidebar about that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| And when you and when you say disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Disruptive to your planning and the teachers planning to change something in January, February for the next calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| I would say it's not. I mean, what when you look at the plans that schools are developing right now, that is that is based in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| you know, the goals that they're beginning to frame their school improvement plans for this year and kind of what the work that they're lifting up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| And certainly in January, February, they would not be at a position to start doing that yet for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| So summertime is when school leadership teams are meeting and developing their plans for the year and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| That would be the window of time that we would see them setting these plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| We would be well ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| And in February, even March, we were talking about like around spring break or something like that could have been the right time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| Mr. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Does that affect like I know that based on the current schedule, we can count the days we're out for those early dismissals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| We can count those as full day or whatever we can count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| And then if we go to two full days, we just lose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Like, what does that do to our number of days in school and weather days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| And does that change anything? Yes. So all of that will still be based on the same calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| So, again, the current model of doing it for six days is a is a two hour draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| So three days equates to one of our stockpile days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| We're using two of those over the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Moving to a full half day continues if we do four of those to use the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| And then again, if we went to full days, it'd be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| So, yeah, full half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Yeah, full, full half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Sorry, I shouldn't be joking on the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| I'll say that I agree with all of you and that looking at the data and seeing especially the hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2474)|
| 0:41:26| and that I think it was roughly 60 percent when you add those two together of hardships that it puts on families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| I know that we have a lot of families that are have a stay at home parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| And, you know, that's kind of like one end of the spectrum where it's a little bit easier for them to potentially manage this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| And then on the other end, we have families that are in communities that have a lot of support and a lot of child care options that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2505)|
| 0:41:55| Provided to them in some way or another, but then I think there's a big gap for a lot of families that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| and that's probably that 60 percent that two working parents, single parents and those things that where this like where they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2522)|
| 0:42:13| have middle school, high school that don't have aftercare and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| And that was initially I had heard I've heard from a lot of parents and some teachers as well that I've been hearing about it for the last year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2536)|
| 0:42:27| And I think that that's really what what brought this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| And so I really I also agree that I like the four half days because there's no confusion about what time is it that I'm supposed to be picking my kids up, especially for me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2552)|
| 0:42:43| I have an elementary school and a middle schooler, and those are four different times, plus the regular times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| And especially when you're you're working and you're doing other things, that's that can be a lot to manage if you don't have someone that's specifically doing it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2568)|
| 0:42:57| So I think I would move to change our current calendar 24, 25 to have four half days and not change the continuing calendar, but reassess later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2577)|
| 0:43:12| A second. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| Yes, this is the one that most families did not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| That is the only part of this whole thing that sort of throws me for a loop is we're looking at these decisions and they like the current model better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2602)|
| 0:43:31| Everybody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| The current is the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I thought more families like that one than the like the early release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| There are the release versus the four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Madam Chair, members of the board, can you restate that question so I can try to answer it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Correct. So my understanding is the least liked option, including the early release days of the current year, doing the very least liked option by families was the four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2630)|
| 0:44:00| It was even lower than the early release days or was the early release days lower than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| No. So if you take all respondent categories, weight them equally, and then look at their preferences, the least liked option was the total elimination of early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2645)|
| 0:44:18| About 15.6 percent of our respondents selected that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The second least favorable option would be our current model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| The second most favored option would be the four half days and the overall most favored option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| And again, that's an average across the board would be the two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| And that's that's we're just talking about the families, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| School families?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| No. So if you're asking, that's across all respondent categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| If you look at just families, then you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| The two full days is the most preferred option outside of no opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Then, yes, that is the least liked option, something that I did want to kind of bring to the table because I know we had provided some additional breakdown on the family choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2695)|
| 0:45:04| One thing worth noting is that, again, we only were able to ask families to elevate one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| So if you take that two full days off the table, and I'm not suggesting that we do, what we can't know based on the survey is what family second choice would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2711)|
| 0:45:20| Makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| Ms. Lauder, I want to clarify because I don't think I heard the answer that I think Mr. Triplett was going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| When you just look at two or four half days and only parents, is that liked less than our current model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2731)|
| 0:45:40| Yes, but what I will say again is that we're making a lot of assumptions that in terms of that's everybody's first choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| So when you take an option off the table because this wasn't a ranked survey, what we can't assume is that everybody would prefer our current model over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2747)|
| 0:45:57| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Once you pull one variable, yes, you kind of change the decision-making matrix then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| I also have a question on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| When you did the survey and you said half day, did you clarify that the half day was different than the early release day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2767)|
| 0:46:19| Yes, so it was clear in the survey you were either choosing an early release day, which is its own independent releasing time, or a half day that aligns to half days already in the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2779)|
| 0:46:33| Sophia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I just want to say from the perspective of a high school student because I know it's different for middle and elementary kids because they have to be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| A lot of high school students do not like the early release and probably would prefer the half days because a lot of us are student athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| It's kind of a lot to just have two hours off and then have to be at practice by 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| If we had a full day off, it would be like, we still have to go to practice, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| So a half day would be great for us because there was a lot of struggles with my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| They're like, do we have practice today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Do we not have practice today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Even if it's not athletics, I was in a musical in the spring semester and our rehearsal still had to be at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| It was just easier to not even leave school, but we had to leave school, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| So half days would probably be in favor of the student body, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I appreciate that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Just speaking to a little bit about what Ms. Elkins said, I will say that while I know it's not a large majority, or I'm going to assume it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2856)|
| 0:47:48| I do know some parents that schedule doctor's appointments, counseling appointments, orthodontic appointments on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| So I do think that when you think in terms of the time it might take to get in with the health care provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| when you kind of take those days out all together, that could create some hardships for those families as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2884)|
| 0:48:14| So I do like the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Ms. Lautner, what percentage of parents responded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| I forgot my survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| How many parents responded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| That is a much easier question to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So a little over 10,500 parents responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| I am one of those parents that makes orthodontic appointments on those days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2913)|
| 0:48:43| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| And then I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I think there's some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So I guess we can go ahead and vote on, can you reread the motion, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| I was going to call you Ms. Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2936)|
| 0:49:06| I believe that she moved to change the 2024-2025 school year calendar to hold four one-half days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| and to reassess the 2025-2026 school calendar at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| So we'll go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=2964)|

| 0:50:39| While I think it's great to have a salary increase, I don't think that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| This is moving everyone to a step that is not the step that they are determined to be at their market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3046)|
| 0:50:57| So if we have money for raises, the money for raises should go into the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| It should go into the steps where they are supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| When we just raise a bunch of people to a new step and put them on what is now could be the wrong step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3067)|
| 0:51:18| could be the right step, it depends because they've not all been sorted out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| we're going to create a disparity at some point between people who have worked a certain number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| and people who are here right now and getting this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| It would be much more sensical if we want to give a raise to put that raise in the scale so that if you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3093)|
| 0:51:41| let's say you are at step two, step two is $10 an hour, raise that $10 an hour to $10.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| instead of kicking them up to another step that is not the correct step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| So I think this plan, while well-intentioned, I feel like it is a band-aid to sort of get folks to let go of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3112)|
| 0:52:07| that they may be on the wrong step instead of just giving a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| I would much rather see this money put with fidelity into the steps instead of willy-nilly moving people's steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3132)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Ms. Owen, thanks for using one of my favorite phrases, willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| It's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Ms. Himmelgaren, my understanding of this is that we are shifting methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| by making the methodology in which we add folks to the general salary schedule the same in terms of step placement as the teacher schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3160)|
| 0:52:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| When our employees on the general scale were transitioned over, they were not granted that plus one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| as our employees on the CERT I and CERT II scales were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So this would be granting them that plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| That was my understanding, and that's why I made the motion to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| in the sense of I think it makes sense to apply the same methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And from what I heard from a lot of folks, that's where the confusion was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| especially for folks who were on the general scale, not understanding that, not making that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| Again, I appreciate the work to consider that as a possibility and also looking for the funds to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| I also don't think it's a Band-Aid in the sense of this is the first time we're moving to this scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| and I think it's an adjustment of methodology that then will be a moot point moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| because after this year nobody will be placed on a scale based on this current methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| because we will be using it for everybody moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay, so now I'm confused, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Because I've heard from employees who are on this scale who say they have been placed at the correct step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| which is last year's step and one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| So if we have already placed employees at last year's step and one more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| then we have a communication problem again because they are going to think they are going to be one more again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| So I think we need to be very, very clear about exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| Having still not actually seen everything, I don't really understand how we can say exactly what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3278)|
| 0:54:48| because we still have this huge number of people who have not been corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| and are they going to understand what step they're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I mean, they don't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| So is this going to make it worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Is this going to confuse things even more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Would it make more sense to hold this a month until all of the corrections have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| and then do whatever needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Because I agree and I understand that everyone should have the same additional step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| That's what we told them they were going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| That's what they should get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| But some people are telling me they've already been given that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| So if they've already been given that, are they getting one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Or are they getting the one they've already gotten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| And have we communicated that to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| How will we communicate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, so the additional step has not been granted to employees on the general scale yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3343)|
| 0:55:51| And our payroll, I'll come back to that in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| because the employees were slotted in two different ways on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| But as far as the process, our payroll and HR departments are still processing payroll for August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3359)|
| 0:56:09| and working through corrections, the final corrections and the final inquiries to the Google form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| So the correct placement prior to the plus one would be instituted first and then the plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| But in response to the first part, as you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| employees were slotted on the general scale in two different ways because we're not taking anyone –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| we're not having anyone paid less this coming year than they were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| So they could have been slotted based on years in the position or their current salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| So that's where there may be – the step question that you brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| they may be on a different step than exact number of years in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| That's where that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Mr. Watson, did you want to respond to Ms. Edwin and then I'll go to Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| Well, not a response, but just I think it's a point of further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| So I asked this on the other night, on Monday night, and I just want to verify that I heard the answer correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| So if we do this, this won't necessarily affect every individual person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| but it will be available to every position within the general salary schedule, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| And the reason I'm stating that and the reason why I think you're doing it is because, as you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| originally there could be one of two ways that you would be put on that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| And by doing this, we're now saying, well, no, there's only one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| And so if you weren't affected by that one way originally, then you will be now and it will be in your favor, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| Because I know there was a chart that Ron put up and that Mr. McPherson put up that showed –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| or not Mr. McPherson, Scott put up, Mr. Bolton, the other guy, that Mr. Bolton put up and it was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| And he had about six examples that showed in certain positions, not by individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| but certain positions how much this might affect from a percentage standpoint, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So obviously if employees are topped out on the general scale at step 20, there would not be an additional step there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| And then employees that were hired after the transition, so new to the district on these salary schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| it would not apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| But yes, all employee categories on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3505)|
| 0:58:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Seeing there's no more discussion on this item, we'll go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Triplett, on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Shamare Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| Shamare, if you will state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And Mr. Brown, if you want to help him lower that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| We need to pull down just a tad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| Make accommodations for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Shamare Amarachi Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Shamare Amarachi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| What does Amarachi mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| You don't remember your middle name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Now, I'm going to help Shamare do this for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| We have pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Yeah, I've gotten old, just so y'all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Y'all might have to leave me down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| Okay, Shamare, who's this picture of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Me and Lieutenant Governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| This is Lieutenant Governor Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| I took Shamare to go meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I was watching TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| He was playing Roblox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And he said, Dad, I want to go meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Normally when I go to functions like that, y'all, you feel like a raisin in a bunch of milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| Everybody ate up all the bran, but I told them I would go there and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Now, when we went there, why did you want to see Mr. Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Because he said he helps families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| So when you went up there, what did Mr. Randy do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| He took me by the hand and led me to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And you got to meet, who is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| That is Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| They were laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| The guy behind the jocks, he laughed, and he was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| you're the only person who's ever got the governor down on his knees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| That's why they're laughing in the background about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And do you know who this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Sheriff Spangler got down to talk to him because he has questions and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| This is Shamare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Now, here's the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| He even remembered the drink that she had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Senator Becky Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Becky Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| She had a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| And I said, how did you know what drink she had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| He said, I saw it in her cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| And he named it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| So now all the time that we were there, what did they keep asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| Why I wasn't looking them in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| I kept wondering why he wouldn't look anybody in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| Everybody kept noticing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| That's why you're all seeing the menu and trying to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| So, oh, before I forget, I have to get a memory for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| State trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| You met a state trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| What did he tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| He said he can retire if I become one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| He wanted to become a trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I said, you go on ahead so we can all retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| So what had happened was when we got in the vehicle, I had asked Shamare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| why didn't you look anybody in the eye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I thought it was the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And what did you tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I thought none of them liked you because Knox County Schools doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| I wanted you all to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| That blew me out of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I make sure that my children do not judge everybody because of a few or because of gossip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| That way they don't grow up prejudiced, racist, bigoted, angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| But this is why I wanted him to come for you all to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| What we do affects them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Now, what do you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| He said, Shamare, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Amarachi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Amarachi out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Amarachi out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| So he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| There you go, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Good job, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3758)|
| 1:02:48| Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Are you speaking as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you for saying my name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| I've never really heard my name known as Mr. John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| But he said it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| If you will state your name and county of residence, and you'll also have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| I don't know we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| My name is Charles Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Today is about legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Mrs. Horn, you and I believe that the Holy Spirit dwells in his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| And that all aspects of our life fall under his lordship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Scripture says that we are supposed to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| And often I've wondered, did you want to deal with the deeds of darkness as they spread around us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| Or did you ask the Father, what is this member in the household of faith talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Did you count the costs, act accordingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| Or did you profit Knox County, but yet lose your soul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Now, I agree with you on some things about books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| However, black Americans should not have allowed white liberals to attach the recognition of our humanity to their agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3838)|
| 1:04:11| But Moms of Liberty, they don't want to speak about the uncomfortable truth about our history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| and the sexual violence that happened during slavery and also during the Civil Rights era, which are my parents' generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| To have true liberty, we need to speak the truth in love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| I don't hear love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Maybe the Moms of Bondage is more fitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Mrs. Bike, now I'll address you at a later time because I don't see where black lives truly matter in your democratic platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| Daniel Watson, you were going to speak to Mrs. Sayers about the family and somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| When you didn't do that, to me that showed white solidarity with racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| I, you adopted black children, but I'm the father of black children by culture, by history, by genetics, by lineage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3904)|
| 1:05:13| Authentic black dads do not have that white out option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| On social media, you spoke a lot about George Floyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| But then along with the superintendent at that time, board administration, lawless department, security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| you participated, and some of y'all did too, in the putting the knees on the necks of melanated children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3927)|
| 1:05:35| Extreme makeover, they rebuilt your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| But I'm going to give you a finishing touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Every time you walked through those doors, you were silent when the evil of racism came to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| I had four kids at high school, and you were complicit with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| You could have at least picked up the trash that some did not want to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| An extreme racial makeover is needed in all of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| And every one of you and the security department are leaving legacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| I'm Mr. Johnson, father and dad of eight, and I approve this message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| Thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Candace Bannister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Candace, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| Hi, Candace Bannister, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Bullying is defined as unwanted aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| The behavior is repeated or has the potential to be repeated over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| The imbalance of power involves the use of physical strength and access to embarrassing information or popularity to control or harm others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| I was 59 years old and in this room before it ever happened to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| Many of you are here and did not attempt to stop it, although maybe you didn't see it the way I felt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| An audience member beside me clapped three times in agreement with something a board member said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| and an officer came to stand near them, saying there, even after the person said to the officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| I'm sorry, I won't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| This may seem insignificant, but this is actually taught as a strategy for how to deal with disruptive students in a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Someone makes a noise, the teacher walks close to the person, the noise stops, the teacher carries on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| It is very effective and the teacher doesn't even have to say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Is it bullying? It doesn't have to be, but context matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Power and patterns matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| I felt my heart took a break through the 15-minute break for the next 20 minutes of the board meeting and even through public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| The audience member's apology should have been enough to end it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| but instead the officer stayed in that place for an extended amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| It was in that time after the break that I began to really feel uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| like I'd done something wrong, like I wasn't welcome here, like I was a bad person, I wasn't worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| I followed my former colleague sitting behind me who could see I was being watched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| or the board members in front of me who might think I don't know how to act in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| The longer it went, the more my heart sped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| And it was in this time that I made the connection to the way our 16-year-old son was treated by administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| on his first day back to school after a long-term suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| On Will's first day back, I rushed home from school like I had a kindergartner who attended school for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| I asked about his day, and he said it went okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| It was pretty good, but then his head dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| He said that he had a visitor in two of his classes who stood over him for 10 to 15 minutes without saying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| He said it was his executive administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Will said it made him feel embarrassed. It made him feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| It made him feel not welcome at his school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| I encouraged him to keep his head down, stay in the middle of his lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| and not to draw attention to himself and that maybe the administrator would leave him alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240808?start=4119)|
