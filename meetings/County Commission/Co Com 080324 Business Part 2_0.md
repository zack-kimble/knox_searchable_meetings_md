| 0:06:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| I actually got a few questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| I'd like to know the difference between 601 and 602, which the Cherokee Health System's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| indigent care and the Knox County indigent care agreement, which I know has to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| the, if you could just explain to me the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| The Cherokee Health System's contract, it's a separate contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| The indigent care contract is a contract with the specialty physicians and the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| And then the Cherokee Health System's contract is a contract between the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| and Cherokee system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So who would be the, I mean, what's the difference in the patients that may be going from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| The Cherokee, would that be someone showing up at the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| That's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Actually, the primary care provider is Cherokee Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| We actually manage the patients and certify them for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| And they actually see the physician or the nurse practitioner at Cherokee Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| So this is someone coming in for services, like someone else may go to a primary physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| where the other one is just care at a hospital, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| The two are interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| We use, if you look at the indigent care contract, 26% of that amount goes to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| We use that amount to contract for the primary care services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| And then my other question deals with, since I wasn't able to be here for the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| and I apologize for that, but 902 was a discussion approving state street property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| And I don't know what you're, what are we approving with the discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| We're not approving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| I mean, if it was discussed, there's nothing to approve or disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| I was just wondering what's it doing on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=495)|
| 0:08:27| It was just a discussion item and it was brought to the commission by way of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| It doesn't need to be there if that's this body's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| I'm just curious of what we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| We're approving that we discussed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Someone made a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Did we discuss it in committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| And was it discussed at committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Commissioner Lutho, I thought we discussed this about four or five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Well, we discussed it the previous month and so, but I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| I just want to know what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| I'd just like to know why we keep discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I have a question in regards to page number 5701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| Who are we accepting this property from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| That's just a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| And is it Mr. Law Director, should we normally record who we're receiving lands from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| Shouldn't we document that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| All right, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Doug Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| You want to address this, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| I'm sorry, are we discussing the Seven Islands property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=589)|

| 0:09:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Yes, what we're doing here is when we purchase Seven Islands property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| there's a tree line and actually a driveway that's very much a part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| but, in fact, belonged to an adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Seven Islands Foundation actually purchased some of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| and is going to be giving that to us, the approximately four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| In exchange, though, when they gave us this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| one of their lots lost the ability to have a good septic system on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| So what we're giving them back is an easement for a septic system on that 0.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| So a good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| We get almost four acres to add to the water refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| It protects the buffer there, both a road and a tree line adjacent to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| In exchange, we give them the ability to put a septic field on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| which is okay with us because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| it's something that will never be developed as a part of the wildlife refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| And so, Mr. Law Director, my question is, do we record who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Shouldn't we record who is giving the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Motion for approval of all the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=655)|

| 0:11:16| Next are the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=676)|

| 0:11:40| Did we have a name for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| I think we asked the law director to send out some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| and probably hadn't heard anything back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I think there need to be four names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| I did that and Jolie says we haven't received any names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| I make a motion and we postpone it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=727)|

| 0:12:33| It's the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| No, I think commission appoints one person, county mayor appoints one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| so I make a recommendation or a motion that we postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=768)|

| 0:13:10| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=792)|

| 0:13:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Mr. Pinkston, I was not here during the committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and I was just wondering if there was any discussion about this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| I assume that this is a vacancy and a replacement for a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| When did Mr. Kaywood vacate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I received this letter roughly a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Was there any discussion about the appointment process, this replacement process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| Were there any other names offered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Commissioner has to be a commissioner from every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| He had one from every district, and his was the only name up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| There was only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| All commissioners are on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| So there's nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| And there's nine members and one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| And his was the only name that was put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Don't we currently have persons who are not commissioners serving on BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| But those were commissioners, and that is not term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| These people are really most of them are starting to resign now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I believe the law director will explain it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| that once these people are appointed, they stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| They can stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| REC's next organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| We'd like for you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Please go ahead, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| It's been the practice of the commission to appoint commissioners to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| But as they leave, if their terms are in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| we had a number that were ultimately term-limited or taken out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| They continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| You do not have to be a Knox County commissioner to serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| It is not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| But the practice has been that that's where you begin, with a member from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| So if you fail to continue as a commissioner, it is not an automatic rejection of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=925)|
| 0:15:36| It does not create a vacancy for that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| And that's why you've had a few commissioners who are no longer commissioners continuing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| A few of those have resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| It is a term, and it is a four-year term, and they're allowed to continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=949)|
| 0:16:02| And I guess I'm making a statement to the body that I think this is a very serious appointment for Knox County, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=962)|
| 0:16:12| With anything that we want to do, I think we need to think long and hard about the type of people we appoint to these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| I think it's Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Other than I feel like possibly Mr. Lambert has held somewhat of an extreme point of view in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=984)|
| 0:16:35| just in my perspective, in my time on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| And I wonder about the judicious nature that needs to be a characteristic of the people that are on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:51| And so for that reason, I would just like to postpone this for 30 days, to make a motion to postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| in that the BZA can act just fine as it is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| and they have in the past with a shortage of people that are on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| And I'd just like for it to be discussed a bit more further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| We need a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| We have a substitute motion on the floor to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Well, I'm just going to say this, that while Mr. Norman considers my views of property rights extreme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| they're no more extreme than his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| I do tend to be the burden of proof rests upon the non-property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| because generally, philosophically, I agree with property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| You know, there's a lot of rights I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| I agree with free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| I agree with the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And if someone once said extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, I view property rights as a liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1075)|
| 0:18:05| Now, not to be said that if there is a legitimate reason to go against a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| if a neighbor is going to be damaged in some way, I have a very open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| And that's why we have the authority that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| I just don't think that that authority should be used on a whim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And, sir, I would challenge you that there are people in this community that would view your views as extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| There are people that would view my views as extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| That's what makes this country great, is folks like me and you can both participate in the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's generally balanced by folks who believe one way and folks who believe another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:54| So I don't see that my views on property rights are any more extreme than Mark Kaywood, who tended to be a pro-property rights person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| Also, this appointment does tend to be a commissioner, and I'm a commissioner that's going to be here for the length of this term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| And so that's why I'm willing to serve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| It's not that Mr. Roundtree wouldn't be a good choice also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| It's just that simply he won't be a commissioner here in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1158)|

| 0:24:06| Ms. Williams, Lisa Williams, is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| There she comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Ms. Williams is with the Knox County Sheriff's Department, and she is a victim's advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and so I think that she is someone that can speak from personal experience as to the importance of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:27| Good evening. Thank you for inviting me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Ms. Williams, would you give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| My name is Lisa Williams. You want my home address? 4403 Costa Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| Strangulation has been identified as one of the most lethal forms of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| When perpetrators use strangulation to silence their victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| this is a form of power and control that has been devastating psychologically affecting the victims and potentially fatal outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:06| Historically, choking has been rarely prosecuted as a serious offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| because many people minimize the seriousness of the violence of strangulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| Strangulation is defined as a form of asphyxia and is characterized by closure of the blood vessels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:28| and the air passages of the neck as a result of external pressure to the neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| Clinically, a victim who has been strangled first experiences severe pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| followed by unconsciousness and then brain death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| To close the jugular vein, it only takes 4.4 pounds of pressure versus an 8 pounds of pressure to pull the trigger of a handgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1548)|
| 0:26:00| A person can lose consciousness within 10 seconds and after 50 seconds of unconsciousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| that is considered the point of no return and victims rarely recover without immediate medical attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| Brain death can occur within 4 to 5 minutes of persistent strangulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| Although you may see marks on a person consistent with strangulation, that is not always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| There is much more internal injuries to the throat because the throat is made up of soft tissue, so you have swelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| And a lot of victims will have symptoms of hoarseness, raspy voice, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:52| This can continue for several days later after the strangulation incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| A victim could have complications or even death several days later because of the continuing of swelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| A broken bone, a broken arm in an assault is considered a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| It's a serious bodily injury, but to be strangled is only a misdemeanor, is a simple assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| And as Russ Jensen has told me today, which I thought was a good quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| there's only two reasons why somebody would ever put their hands around another person's throat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| and that is one to control them and one to kill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you, Ms. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| May I ask what this bill does? I know that it strengthens the penalties for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| It does. It changes what Ms. Williams was saying, that it changes strangulation, adds it to a felony, whereas now it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| And that's what this legislation does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| I think we've already approved it, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Did you announce that it passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Resolution 203 is approving a grant agreement in the amount of $20,550 with the State of Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:27| for the provision of providing students with access to the GoTriBee website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Mr. Freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| I would just like to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I've looked into this GoTriBee website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I was not very impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| I know that this money is not coming from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| It's coming from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| And someone wrote a grant and they're getting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| But I just wanted to make a comment and go on record as saying that I think $20,550 would be better spent in gym equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| than a computer program to monitor their activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Although I may agree with you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| I think we have no choice since this is on the education consent and the schools get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| we settled a lawsuit which allows them to put items such as this on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| and we're not allowed to vote it down or to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| We're not allowed to change it, but we're allowed to ask questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And I appreciate your questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Is there anybody from the school system that could respond to this website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1781)|

| 0:31:22| of the County of Knox by Hardin Valley Investment Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| Did you say 401 or 201?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1896)|

| 0:31:40| 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| It failed 4-1-1 abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1901)|

| 0:31:48| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1908)|

| 0:32:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Is anyone here from Hardin Valley Investment Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| I'm Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| I'm representing the partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Gary Higgins is also here, a member of the partner in the partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Is this the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| This is the Steel Road situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| We've been getting a lot of calls, and I'm sure Mr. Roundtree has been getting a lot of calls as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| The folks in that area really want to keep Steel Road opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| and they certainly don't want tax increment financing that some folks view as taxpayer money to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| to have their road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Is your organization willing to work with the neighbors and keep Steel Road opened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| The partnership didn't advocate closing Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| It was the – and Mr. Wheatry probably is better to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| It was the county that proposed diverting the existing Steel Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| so that it lined up fully with Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| We're fine with that side plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| We're also fine with the side plan that keeps Steel Road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| That's what I thought it was going to be, is aligning the two roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| so you don't have offsetting intersections going straight across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Can you accommodate these neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I mean, it's virtually everyone who lives on Steel Road wants to keep Steel Road opened as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| There's two things that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| The closure of Steel Road would have to be approved by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| You can't – we just can't shut it down as a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| I think the existing Steel Road would be better utilized for the school itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| and, in fact, we've sent a set of plans over to the school board for their review also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Secondly, there's another process that's going to have to take place before they'd be able to implement their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| They would have to go back through the Metropolitan Planning Commission for a revised concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| so additional public input could be obtained for this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Well, these neighbors are really expecting the threat of Steel Road being closed to be stopped today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| I can't, in good conscience, vote for this unless I know that Steel Road is going to be preserved for these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| Steel Road cannot be closed unless you all take action to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Your action in regards to their plan does not close Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| It still would be maintained as a Knox County public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Additional action would have to be taken by this board in order to actually close Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I mean, do we have a commitment from you to keep that road open for these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And I'm not trying to be evasive about it, but, ultimately, the decision of that road closure is left up to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Someone could file an application to close that road, but you all have to act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| So, ultimately, the decision is made by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| It's not a decision that I would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I can do temporary closures for maintenance and so forth, but when we close a road permanently, it has to be done by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I mean, are you going to request in the near future as a part of this project to close the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| We were not anticipating doing that, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I talked to Commissioner Roundtree earlier today, and I've since spoke with the developer about the concerns about closing Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Given those concerns, we do not anticipate closing Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| And, here again, anything that's done with Steel Road as far as its disposition as a public road, that's left solely up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Bruce, I guess we've changed since the last meeting because someone said that we would be closing Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| The developer had contacted us with wanting to close Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| After Mr. Roundtree called me, I have since spoke to the developer, and I don't think they want to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| But, here again, anyone can file an application to close a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| The process is filed through my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| We handle the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| But, ultimately, it ends up in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| So, after my discussion with the developer, they're not interested in pursuing the closure of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I guess the second question then, if we're not going to close Steel Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| why would we use a TIF of a million dollars of taxpayer money just to create a road through this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| It would be for the realignment of the intersection of, I guess we'd rename it, it would be probably an adjunct of Steel Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| the realignment of Steel Road with Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| But the alignment just runs through the development and over to where the school, and then it would turn back on to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| The primary alignment of Steel Road would be to Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| The existing Steel Road would be a secondary access to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| It could also be used to access Steel Road itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| But it benefits the developer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| You would probably have to ask them as far as their benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| But the alignment of those intersections does provide some transportation benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Mike Edwards is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Does he want to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Because you've talked to us about TIFs and retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| And this is, I think, for Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| You look so happy, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I think Todd would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| We have site plans for both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| If you want to go through these, we went through them at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| But, you know, this is TIFs are best used for infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:59| and have been traditionally used in blighted areas by housing authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| About three years ago, the legislature granted powers to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| which would require county commission's concurrence to provide tax increment financing outside of blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:22| And that's what we're starting to see is applications from developers, particularly retail developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:32| The county's policy has been and is today that developers are required to do all the on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| and off-site improvements of their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And what this does on a case-by-case basis is allows you to waive that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| and shift that burden off of the developer onto the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| by taking future proceeds to pay for these infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| If it is your desire for the Industrial Development Board to take this on and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:17| that would be a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| However, the IDB should consider it, whether the recommendation comes out whole or in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:31| or none of what the developer has asked for is part of the IDB's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:42| And then it would come back to you, this body, to actually approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| It requires both the IDB and the county commission taking a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| And this meeting only refers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| It's not a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| I guess my question is, it seems like nobody ever comes up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| and talks opposing a TIF until they were a couple in North Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| And then it seemed to be that we don't want to do retail development TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| to improve infrastructure on roads and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| And now we've got one back down west again at Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| and it seems like nobody has come up to oppose anything in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Now, what's the difference between this one at Steel Road going to the food city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| and one going out north to Walmart or Lowe's or Home Depot to improve infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| for the people I represent in the seventh districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| Well, first of all, anything I say should not be construed as in support or in opposition of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:53| What I've told you is basically about as factual information as I know how to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| The commission has taken a number of TIFs in the past from housing, from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:11| KCDC, and that would be the downtown TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| It is anything that you are doing out in a designated blotted area, which has been their powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:24| and yours for many, many, many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Since the IDB has gotten these requests, which has been a relatively short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| we have done two, one, and I've got it, one TIF, South Grove and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:53| It is where we're trying to figure out is how do you make a decision that will basically govern a policy going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2513)|
| 0:42:07| You really can't look at performance because they can kind of own a developer's performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| because they can tell you just about really very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| For example, this is just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| If a developer wants help and for you to pay the traffic lot that normally is required for the developer to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:34| it's going to be extremely hard to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Once you hear future arguments from future developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| it's going to be extremely hard to distinguish those arguments from the ones you've granted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| You're really going to be setting a precedent, and it's going to be tough, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| for you to discern the different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| That being said, this body can make policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and if you can articulate clearly the standard that we should use, when should we pull the trigger on a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| I think the IDB would take that guidance very clearly, but it's not a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| We're looking for some guiding principles that, in short of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| we're going to be left trying to figure out if this happens, how do we get this to comply with every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| and what impact that will have on the county budget going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I guess my last question, you know, you talk about or we hear people talk about blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| We're talking about if it's $1 million or $2 million in the ninth district, seventh district, or first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| You know, we sit here and approve something down at the five-point center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| How did that work out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| We've done South Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| How did it work out so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I think if we're going to spend taxpayer money wherever it needs to go, I think it needs to make business sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| that we're going to at least recoup our money and not do it somewhere just to say we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:18| One of the issues in regard to retail development is that if the market is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:28| the retailers are going to figure out a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| And this county really has seen very little obstacle to whether big box retail or any other retail restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:45| Once it wants to be in an area, it may be hard to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| but they will figure out a way or developers will figure out a way to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| There's a considerable amount of money involved on both retailer and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| If the market is not there, then all the incentives in the world aren't going to make the market there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| It's not going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| And I think that if lessons learned, and it's hard to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| You know, you look at downtown Knoxville, which is a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| There is a lot of retail that could have gone in downtown that would have not been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| And yet Mass General Store has exceeded its first-year business plan by 100 percent, which is extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:40| But it's a destination shopping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| I don't mean to give a tutorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| but the thing is that retail is going to figure out where it wants to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| And you guys, as you see every month on zonings and stuff, that they're going to figure out a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2752)|
| 0:46:02| Commissioner Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Mike, historically has this not gone to the IDB before it comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| Why are we looking at this now before you address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| Because, you know, let me go to the housing authority incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:25| I think it's the city in this case, but there's people in the audience that have done work with the cities in the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| But it's generally the city that will determine that it wants work done in a particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| And then it will go and ask KCDC to look and see if that meets the blotted area test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| and to develop a district by which that can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| And then KCDC comes back to the city council and to you all if there's a tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| Industrial Development Board, let me, that what I just described is community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| It's important and it needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| Industrial Development Boards are not well equipped to think through community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| Greenfields, suburban fields are not blotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And IDBs are created with the purpose of creating jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| And when you look at job creation, this doesn't fit into that mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| We, frankly, are having difficulty in trying to figure out when a TIF is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:45| It doesn't really make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| If we're offering incentives on the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| it's always to the company that is creating the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| And the jobs are those that we are targeting at the salary rates and at the capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Retail jobs are not what we're trying to recruit, so that doesn't fit into that mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| And we're not really, and if we're dealing with a prospect that has a developer involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| we ask the prospect to deal themselves with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| We deal directly with the company creating the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| That doesn't fit into this mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Really, we're back to a form of suburban community development that is a way for the county to use a financing mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:41| other than going into appropriated dollars or going into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| You then have the third one using tax increment financing, if that would be your wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I really appreciate you coming to this body asking for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| You've done that multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| And, you know, I'm nothing against a food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I think that area could probably use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| But I don't see that the use of these public dollars are, you know, really appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| This is in search of brevity, I think, and trying to get us to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| First, so that everyone will know where I stand, I think as the resolution reads, I want you to go off and study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| That's what this is getting you to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| The second thing is I don't agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| There isn't any incentive here that we're trying to get someone to do something for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| We, the citizens of Knox County, were not wanting to close Steel Road, but realign Steel Road so that in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:53| all this traffic would be at a traffic light, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Well, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| That's in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| That's what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| And it brings me then to my third question that I really want someone to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| In the spiral bound, there was a line, a cost associated with their contribution of real estate for this relocated, not closed, road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:21| What I would like to have considered by the IDB is the portion of that real estate that remains, whether we give it to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:30| system, whether we divide it down the center line and give it half to the schools and half to this developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| or we give it all to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| I think it needs its own line on the plan to somewhat wash off their contribution in dollars toward this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:48| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| And so since you see I'm in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| eventually somebody is going to have to move that the resolution pass and I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3052)|
| 0:51:04| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| We still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| When the school board was talking about who was going to be rezoned to the new Hardin Valley Academy High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:25| the concerns from the people in the fifth district that lived in very deep west Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| or Knox County in the Farragut area was the concern about traveling down Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| especially teenagers that would be students at this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| and their safety in trying to get to from where they live to this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| And I would assume some of those same concerns would be of the parents of those that live in the sixth district that would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3109)|
| 0:52:00| to travel this route as well to get to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| And I don't see this TIF as money for to help the developer so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:14| because the developer said he's going to build the food city there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| He doesn't need the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| It was more of that it was a way to help Knox County with realigning the intersection to make it safer for the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:34| and to me especially the students that are going to be trying to get to this new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| I think we need to try to make it better for these students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| and to the new traffic pattern of the people trying to get to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| And that's why I'm in favor of at least taking a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| To me it's not a matter of helping out this developer, because I don't know how much it's going to help him in his development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| but it certainly will make it much safer for the students at this new school in trying to get there safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| and to go back home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| And that's why I can support it, because I think this is for the public good, not necessarily for a private investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:20| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| To follow up on what Craig just said, Bruce, I believe, did you not recommend that we take a look at a TIF on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:31| because of the fact that we could realign the roadways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| Yes, sir, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| The developer had approached us with different plans and really wanted to know what the county's participation could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| given the fact that they would like to realign these roads or that it would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| I told them our, quite frankly, our budget didn't allow us that type of luxury, but they might want to pursue a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Mr. Michael, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| I've done a lot of, I thought I understood what a TIF was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| I consider myself a reasonably intelligent guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| but when I began to hear different people from the public tell me what a TIF was or wasn't, I wanted to find out for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| So I spent a lot of time talking to developers about TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| also to people I consider a whole lot more intelligent than me about how these work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| But when I was with TVA, we did a lot of seed planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| And if I'm not correct, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| What I see TIFs as is more of an investment, at least on a retail side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| I see it more as an investment that helps bring a retail center, a retail type establishment in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:52| that ultimately winds up being a huge payback tax-wise for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| I mean, obviously, the piece of property that they develop is worth a very small amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| a very small percentage of the amount of taxes we'll be collecting after the TIF is completely paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| So it's almost like a loan from the county that's paid back with interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| in that we're going to collect the tax dollars from that for many, many years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I'm trying to make it simple so that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| But where it gets complicated is when you look at this on the macro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| Can the county budget sustain this with every commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| where the county takes on the responsibility for the off-site infrastructure development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| And if that development was going to occur either at that location or another location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| but the county was going to continue to grow and include in commercial and retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| the investment would be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| And now I'm starting to get into the editorial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I've got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| I'd like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| You need to think through whether or not a big box developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| or a development or a shops are going to occur in an area or in Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| If you go to some of these counties and there's been a lot of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| and Oak Ridge had a huge debate on this because they really are short on retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| But there they're trying to prime the pump and get retail going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| I'm not certain that Knox County is short on retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| And for that reason, the decision needs to be thought through as to whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| And while it is not an incentive, you do have a policy that you have been managing through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| because you're not setting with the capacity and the budget in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| you have asked the developers to do both the on and off-site improvements that is required for their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| And they've either done it or they walked away and stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| But the county has not failed to develop under that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| Now that we have this power to do this, we're getting requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| And the question is, if you start down this road, what does it look like in model once you've done it a whole lot of times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:51| Well, and, Mr. Chairman, that's one of the reasons I wanted to ask him this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| I think as a commission, we need to give the IDB direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| I mean, they need to have clear direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Obviously, we have two before us that I believe we need to send to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| But I believe that we need to be able to give them clear direction on what a TIF looks like, what it's for, and how it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| And I don't know if we do that by setting up a committee of four or five people to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| and to give them back, you know, some clear guidelines on how they should work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| and how they're going to work in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Because if we don't, what I can see happening, and that's one reason I talk to all kinds of different developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| I could see, and I use Gettysville a lot as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| But, you know, I could see if I was going to develop a Gettysville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| come in and say, well, you know, I'm going to put $15 million worth of tax dollars from those homes some day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| into the coffers, so I want a TIF for you all to build all my roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Now, you know, and I understand what you're saying is we've got to get somewhere to where here's the guidelines for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3532)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you, Mr. Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Mr. Weitrich, you don't have to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| You and I have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| We know the issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I did hear from more than five of our constituents in Hardin Valley over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| Apparently there was a flyer distributed in that area and asking folks to call me and Commissioner Lambert, which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:30| I had some really good conversations with some people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Their issue is they really would like to see Steel Road by the elementary school remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| And there's also some question, and we can talk about this later, Bruce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| with the blue line stream at the bottom of the hill, I believe it's called Connor Creek, and the bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| So we will talk about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| But I just wanted to let this commission know that the people in Hardin Valley are very concerned about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| and they're concerned about their growth and the safety of the school kids out there on those two large campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Yes, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Can they proceed with this development without this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| What I'm trying to say is do they meet all the requirements that the county asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| Yes, sir, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| They don't have to make these road improvements, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| We have approved a plan that does not relocate Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| They have that plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| And it's been approved by the planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| But, I mean, they've met all the requirements to go forward without a TIF even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| What I'm getting to, you put this in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Now, we all know what a TIF does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| It brings in taxes that's generated by the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| The taxes stay froze for what they are until this TIF is paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Let's face it, you don't have the money to do this, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| And you're looking down the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| So what we're doing basically is we're letting this development pay for this with the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| the taxes it's going to generate, instead of raising tax dollars to have to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Essentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I would have to agree with what you said, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| They can do this without it, but somewhere down the road we're either paying for it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| or we have to raise taxes to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I guess Bruce or whoever wants to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Has anybody talked to the school board members down there to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Because I was hearing, I can't remember from which board member they were concerned about the traffic going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| I guess a retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| To answer your question, we provided a plan to the school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| In turn, they intend to take it to the school board, but they did tell me that wouldn't be until their April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| The school staff has reviewed it, and it is going on to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| Additionally, this plan, if this road, in fact, does get relocated, they're going to have to go back before the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| Planning Commission as a revised concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| So further public input will be taken at that time, because essentially the plan they have approved now doesn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| for the relocation of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| And, in fact, the action, whatever action you all take or whatever action the IDB takes, still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| they're going to have to go back through the Planning Commission process and be reviewed there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Have we got any numbers, projections on what the sales tax revenue would be off of the Walgreens and the Food City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:36| Or is that something that you do later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| We don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I'm Todd Napier, Development Corporation, Knox County, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| I don't know if he's provided us a draft economic impact plan, and I don't have that with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| but that's kind of the next step in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Do you, Todd, see any difference in something like this than what we're going to see coming up with the two outing halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:12| You know, I think the differences are the developer, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| with the Food City development says that they can develop their project without this improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| and that it's basically an opportunity lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| If you want the road through this piece of property, you need to let me know now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and whether or not you're going to be providing tax increment financing to help do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| because otherwise my plan is to develop a site in such a way that would preclude this from being able to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| The way I see the one up in halls is it's not so much that if you don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| you can't build this certain road or improve this road later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| but it's more of a these improvements need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| and I'm proposing to do that as part of my development using tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I don't know if that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| When you say doing this road down west, is it on one of our top ten lists if we're going to do it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:24| Or the top 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| Our list probably doesn't go back to the top 25, but it certainly is not in the top ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| It's something that, if without the development going in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| probably wouldn't have much thought given to it, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| because of other problems we have throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| not because it's not a good idea, it's just because I have more pressing problems in other parts of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| all across the county for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Would the Walgreens, this might be to the developer, whoever wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Would the Walgreens, if this road doesn't go through, would Walgreens still be in this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| If the road does not go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| I mean, I'm sorry if there's been some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| Our original site plan had the food city essentially where the road would go with the Walgreens on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| So that was the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| After meeting with the county road folks, a different concept plan was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| It's been approved by MPC that Bruce was mentioning that left Steel Road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| And then I, and maybe it was my misunderstanding that then there was a third concept plan that just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| it's not been approved by anyone that showed Steel Road being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| We thought it was in response to additional comments that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| but the developer is happy with the existing concept plan that leaves Steel Road open and it loops around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| And Walgreens would be to the left of the extended Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| And if the extension is not built, Walgreens is essentially on just a little bit different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| So it would be the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| And we estimated the sales tax revenues to the county roughly $225,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| I can't remember who asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| But obviously that's just based on a typical food city and a typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| So you do have contracts already with Walgreens and Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Well, we're, Food City is being finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| They've announced, they've signed a letter of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| They are still, they've got a lot of stores in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| So we're still finalizing a lease with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| And they're aware of the road situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| They were satisfied with not having a road going in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| and are not interested in bearing the cost of the road as part of their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| And so that's why being here really from a TIF, this is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| this certainly is not a situation where the shopping center won't go ahead without the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| It's merely a situation of do you want these public improvements done, essentially the foresight of doing them early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| And Food City was finalizing their agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| Yes, they have a letter of intent and they haven't signed the lease yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| And what about Walgreens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Do they have the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| They don't have a signed contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Mr. Higgins is the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| He's shaking his head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| They don't have a signed contract back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| But they're certainly expected to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Because I've heard from out there that Walgreens is also looking at another corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| If you want to comment, we're not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| By the way, cookies from Becky are going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| She figured this might be a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| I just want to mention that we might want to try to get ahead of the curve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| As Mike Edwards mentioned, precedent is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| And let's just look at what's happening elsewhere around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| The city of Chicago has more than a hundred TIF districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| some of them in the most prosperous areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| It's already moved one city councilman to recommend a TIF moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| Last year, the city of Kansas City, a new mayor, came out of nowhere and won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| And his platform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| A TIF moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Planning Magazine last year had a very good article on what represented a good TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| and what represented a bad TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| And this is well beyond what it recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I think when Commissioner Daniels was right about sending a message to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| but what the message should be, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| A question of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Some of these other TIFs, we did this for Mr. Grahams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| We did this with Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| He agreed and if he was annexed by the city that the TIF would come to right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| Would you also agree to the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| If you're annexed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Yes, we certainly would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| To me, this sounds like, and I was not privy to the discussions at Intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| but to me it sounds sort of like corporate welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| And welfare is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| But I think what we've heard from Mike is that we need to determine when it's needed to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| and when it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| We have a motion on the floor to approve and it's been second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Can I get the noes to raise their hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| We need a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4197)|

| 1:11:09| And this would be for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| John, I'm going to mention this just to you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| We're sort of counting on you to let us know what is our limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| I mean, can we do 50 million a year, 10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I just need to be, because I don't want to overextend this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| And how much do we need to stretch out over a year's time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| I think the discussion needs to be first what would fit within the budget and what would fit within the priorities of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| the things that fit within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| And so our budget is very much constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| And you'll see a lot of things that are good ideas this year not in the budget because we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| I just don't want to affect our bond rate or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| How much can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Commissioner McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| One other question for Mr. Troyer before he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| And that's, I guess, in general, is your staff out there looking at these other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| looking at these other, the history of TIFs and these other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| seeing how they're used and misused and kind of benchmarking some things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| We have not done research like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| We have had some discussions with Mr. Edwards and we expect to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:22| I need to have a motion to reconsider 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| We need to take that off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I'll make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| I'll give a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| We consider the vote of yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| We have a, it was approved with an amendment and then the governmental finance didn't have the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| The school system does not want the amendment on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| I'll make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| This was an amendment in one of the committees I think was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| and that was an amendment proposed by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| We received word from the school superintendent that they do not wish to entertain that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| They wish it to be passed as it is written, as it is contained in your books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| It's paragraph C-20 of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| The amendment was to add a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| The SPO, school police officer, shall not be required, that was the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| to conduct any interviews with the news media concerning a school incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| The way that it reads is the SPO shall not conduct any interviews with the news media concerning a school incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| I know the sheriff was here at the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| The sheriff, he did not object to the language change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| Schools does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| So they do not wish to entertain that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| Like I say, this was an agreement that we worked on for a year and pretty much is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| They do not wish to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| With one of the committees having an amendment, it shouldn't have been placed on consent anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| The superintendent, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| And who was the superintendent, by the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| He's at work already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Still, the superintendent is Roy Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Yes, I had a question about this on D-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| And I guess this would be for school personnel, but do they have access to an air-conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| and properly lighted private office containing a telephone line to be used for general business purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I just want to know how feasible this was to provide this request both financially and practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| And I didn't know if there was somebody from the school system to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| They've got their own meeting going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| I don't think there's anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| No one here from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I mean, have they seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| So, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| What it is, I mean, that's to provide a place, obviously, for this SPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| You know, so they can be in and out of the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Yeah, but I've worked in Knox County schools before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| And it's very difficult sometimes even to find a place to work with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| And I just didn't know how practical or this requirement would be to offer, especially like in some of these smaller schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:26| to give them an air-conditioned and properly lighted private office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| We have a motion on the floor to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Okay, I make a motion that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| And that's to approve it the way without the amendment originally written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:16| Page 13, Resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| This is regarding an application for tax increment financing filed with the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| by Willow Creek, GP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Ten-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| We have a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| We just had a lengthy debate on the merits of tax increment financing, and I think we need to just send this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| like we did the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| I'm going to object to the call because I do have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| I mean, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| I mean, I just don't want us to break into the whole debate again over TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| Well, I'd like to know what this is for because my vote on the last one was based on what the TIF was going to do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| Knox County, and my vote on this one would be the same as what does it do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| And I would just like to be able to discuss that if that would be all right, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I'll withdraw it, but I'd like to get out of here before midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| So would I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Quit asking all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I'm also in favor of this one being passed to IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| The question that I ask is about the size of the zone several miles away on Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| I would think that existing residential housing increases in value probably would not be a result of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:08| and would like for that to be looked at and maybe decreased as a part of your recommendation back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| When we took this item up a couple of months before, some people were saying I should abstain because of family-owning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| property that they were going to reap some great benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| So I'm going to abstain from voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| I have one person from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Joe Minichilio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| Right last month, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| I missed it this year, this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Commissioners, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| My name is Joe Minichilio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| I live at 311 Lindy Drive in Knoxville in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| Philosophically, I'm against TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| If you read the TIF charter, it very clearly states that this program is to be used for blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:13| I know one of the reasons developers want this is it's a bailout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| Very simply to me, what seems to be going on here is Mr. Griffin wants to build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and then he discovers that he needs plumbing for the house, and he wants me to pay for the plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| But I don't get to use the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| It's his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| This is a free enterprise system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| If Lowe's or Walmart or Food City or anyone else wants to come in here and do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| they should be able to afford to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| I think we have to consider what we're doing to the taxpaying small businesses that go up North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| and up 33 to this 40 acres of land that's going to be concreted over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| If God were illustrating the Bible again, he would use this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| I don't really need another Lowe's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| I pass by frequently the South Grove development that people have mentioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| I have an empty old Walmart building that nobody's rented, that nobody's developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| because they went to newer quarters down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I really fail to see the improvement in that situation down there except for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| We're heading into uncertain financial times, according to any financial news network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| or commentator that you want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| And all I hear here is about promises of future taxes, promises of future taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| Well, what if they don't come through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| My taxpayer money, instead of going to projects which really should help the taxpayer in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:58| is going to help line a developer's projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| I hope we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Oh, and my last point is that Mr. Edwards seems so close to be on the verge of saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:13| That's what I hear loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Could we just say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Because he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| We give it to one developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| What's going to prevent my friend Mr. Jernigan from coming up here and saying he wants one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Or any of the other hundreds of developers who are going to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| We have to draw the line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| You do have the power to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Nowhere does it say that you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| So on behalf of those small businesses up the Route 33 and the other taxpayers of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| please tell the developer that if he wants to do it, he's got to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| I don't know if Mr. Graham is here or if someone can answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Is this, did we not just vote on this a couple of months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| And if we did, what's the difference between what we voted on then versus now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| Commissioner, again, Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| This is the same matter you voted on a couple of months ago for procedural reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| It was asked that it come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| It's the same expenses that are being asked to finance, to be financed as part of the tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| as were presented before essentially to public roads, improvements to Quarry Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| and a new connector road between Emery Road and Maynardville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| improvements along Maynardville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| and then a Greenway Creek relocation behind the shopping center that would be dedicated to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| It's the same improvements that were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| They're not asking, they're not increasing the TIF area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| No, in fact, Commissioner Wright's point is a very fair one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| The size of the area will need to be decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| It's going to be decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Yes, of the TIF area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Someone who worked on the legislation, it wasn't intended to be quite so broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| But that was not Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| You know, Mr. Graham wasn't that familiar with the legislation as he was putting the size there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| The property that can be subject to the TIF area has to directly benefit from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| And I would agree with Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| There's probably some properties that are included that are probably a little bit attenuated from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| If we decrease the number of properties that are within the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| does that not increase the length that it will take to repack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| Repay the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Many of the properties, as Commissioner Wright, were the more residential that would be further away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| that would relatively make a small impact on the incremental income that would be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| The vast majority of the incremental tax increment would be coming off the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| I voted for this a couple of months ago because it did make public improvements that would not be done without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:05| And getting back to what Mike Edwards asked then and has asked now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:15| what are we expecting when we send these TIFs on to the IDB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| And I said then, and I'll say it again now, is I don't expect, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| I don't expect you to come back with necessarily the five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| You might come back with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| You might come back with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| You may come back with three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| It was my intention for you all to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| and to figure out what part of this is a legitimate TIF site and for the betterment of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| and how much of this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| And if you come back and say, we don't think that it deserves any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| Well, that's fine with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| So I'm just, you know, I guess my words of guidance are take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| figure out what is needed public improvements that wouldn't be done without this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| And if you come back and say, we don't see one, then you don't see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| And that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| So I'll vote in favor for it before and I'll vote for it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any substantial, you know, change in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| No, Commissioner Luthold answered most of my questions or made the comments that I was going to make, so I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| I agree with Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| One question I do want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Mr. Graham, if you'll real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Well, both of you guys will be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| If it comes back, what were we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| Was it down to five or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| What were we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| It was five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Now it would be a max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Yeah, that was a max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| If it comes at 1.5 or it comes at three, are you going to agree whatever that the board says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| You'll take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| We'll just have to evaluate the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| The size may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| It may be reduced, but we'll be glad to go through IDB and work through all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| And the numbers are what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| We can't make that decision until we go through all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Is there anything you want to say, Mr. Graham, while you're there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Anything that rumors have been going around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Anything that you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Good luck on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Yes, I just want to say I don't even know why this is back before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| We're sitting inside the IDB board like we did a month or two ago here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| and they may come back and say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| But I want everybody here to try to make you understand maybe the way I am to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| We are growing so fast in population here that we have to make these road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| Now, you have to realize the housing industry does not bring in the taxes that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| They're only assessed 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| We need all the sales tax we can get, and business and commercials are taxed 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| in which, you know, one little business will bring in more probably than a $500,000 house in West Knoxville or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| But we have to do these things because we do not have the money to pay for these road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| Now, I'm not saying that we're going to do all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| but we're asking the professionals to come back and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| The IDB board are the professionals in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| We need to listen to them with whatever they come back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| But we have to have this or else we're really going to have to raise the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| And like I said, we're either paying for it this way without it being a burden on the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| or we raise the taxes and put a burden on the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Mr. Pinkston is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| I haven't done the math here lately, but I did it a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| and it would take at least a half-million-dollar home on the tax roll to even pay for a break-even amount of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| for what the average cost of providing services for that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| when you factor in the amount of students a household will have on average and the cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| So residential tax dollars bring in little amount of money, but high amount of service costs to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:38| whereas commercial brings in a high amount of tax dollars and very little service costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| So he is correct when he says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Put your lad on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5336)|

| 1:29:50| I'll get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I believe the law director said he needed to talk to us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I'll make a motion that we go ahead and approve it so we can get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Yes, we are, of course, under a permanent injunction from Chancery Court as a result of the sunshine lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:14| As part of that injunction, this commission has been ordered pursuant to the sunshine law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| to report in writing semi-annually to the court of its compliance with the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:31| So I've prepared a couple of questions to ask both groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| The group, I have you divided in two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| One, 11 commissioners who have been on the commission since October 5-07, the date of the court's memorandum in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| And the second set of commissioners who have been on the commission for a little over a month since February 20, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:59| Let me start with and what we're going to do is we're going to have this part of our transcript transcribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| We're going to provide a report to the court with the attached transcript| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| and that will be, I believe, sufficient compliance with the court's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:19| So let me start with and these questions generally are going to be asked of each group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| The questions are these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| First question is, since October 5-07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| have any of you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting the items set on the next agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| whatever agenda that would have been for the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| or subjects within the jurisdiction or scope of responsibility of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| And I'm going to ask each one of you that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| The next question is, since October 5-07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| have any of you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting items that can properly appear on an agenda of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| commission or subjects on which the county commission is empowered to act or advise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Those generally are the two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| I can start at either end, but I need to go commissioner by commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| If you'll indulge me for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Is this something that we can get back with you on so we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I would like to consult my private attorney because the last questions, I think I'm being sued now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| So I want to make sure that since the county doesn't want to represent anybody when a matter happens to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| in a personal suit against any elected official, I don't feel comfortable tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| without consulting my private attorney first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| Commissioner, if you wish to do that, first of all, I take exception to your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| But if you wish to do that, if you wish to talk with an attorney before you answer these questions, you're welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| You can answer through an attorney if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| If I have a conversation that needs to be cured by talking about it publicly, is now a time to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| or do we need to do that directly before that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Wait until I get to you and then you can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Let's start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I'll just start with the first district, Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Since October 5, 2007, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| the items set on the next agenda for the county commission or subjects within the jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| or scope of responsibility of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| I think I need to recuse myself since my name is on this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| And I still don't know how my name got to be the lead person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| It's all your fault and that's why you're chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| He is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| It is John McElroy II and Alfred Ackerman versus Thomas Strickland, et al.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5665)|
| 1:34:35| Commissioner Strickland, since October 5, 2007, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| items that can properly appear on an agenda of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| or subjects on which the county commission is empowered to act or advise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| No, not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| Commissioner Harmon, same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Since October 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Mark Harmon, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| Since October 5, 2007, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting the items set on the next agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| for the county commission or subjects within the jurisdiction or scope of responsibility of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Since October 5, 2007, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting items that can properly appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| on an agenda of the county commission or subjects on which the county commission is empowered to act or advise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| Same questions, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| And if you wish for me to read these or not every time, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Same two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| You don't need to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| It's no on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Do I have to read them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| No on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| No on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Commissioner Greg Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| No and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Commissioner Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| If yes, who and with whom and about what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| I want to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| During the trial, I talked to the attorneys involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| I talked to Rick Hollow and I talked to him about how to cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| I said, if I have a conversation with someone, how do you cure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| He said, you talk about that conversation openly before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| So, yes, prior to this meeting, I did have some conversations with Mr. Roundtree on an item that we are going to vote on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:46| My intention was that right before that vote was to disclose that conversation so that we would cure any violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:56| And do I need to do that now or do I need to do that directly before that vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Well, you'll still have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| You can refer back to this discussion if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| But if you would, in some detail, explain what that conversation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| Well, basically, when the at the last committee meeting, it was talked about that we would appoint a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| that the mayor would appoint a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| And the rumor came out that Bob was chosen to be on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| So I went to the mayor and he said, yes, that Bob had been chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| And I talked to Dwight Vandervate specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| He said, yes, that Bob Roundtree had been chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And I said, well, I really have some compelling reasons why I think I should be the one to be on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| And he said, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| He said, we don't want to retract an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| He says, why don't you call Bob and talk to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| So Bob and myself had some conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I wasn't thinking at the time that we would have to confirm the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| So at the time, I wasn't thinking about that this might come to us for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| And then after a couple of conversations, I realized, yes, this is going to come to us for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| And I told Bob, I said, we're going to have to disclose in compliance with the Sunshine Law to cure these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| We're going to have to disclose these conversations before the vote comes down on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| So I have not voted on anything yet that I have spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| And my intention was, and I'm coming forward here today to say, my intention was to directly before that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:45| to disclose that conversation to cure any violation that may or may not have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| That's a matter that is set on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| So the question again is, since October 5, 2007, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| the item set on the next agenda for the county commission or subjects within the jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| or scope of responsibility of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| You've answered yes with that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Are there any other conversations that you've had, any other discussions that you've had with a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| which would also require it to be identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Commissioner Roundtree, do you recall the discussion the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| Mr. Law Director, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Commissioner Lambert and I did talk about this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| That was the only item we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| As a matter of fact, during the course of the conversation, we both hit the pause button and said we need to stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| We probably are in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| But Mr. Lambert is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I'll come back to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Commissioner Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Oh, and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Commissioner Scott Moore, do you wish to reserve comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| We have to respond as a commission by within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| I intend to file a report with the court, with or without your comments, by the 5th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:21| I would certainly prefer to have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| So if you can talk with counsel and provide answers to these questions for me, it may save all of us a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:34| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| No and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Commissioner Kingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| I haven't talked to anyone about a vote, but Ms. DeFries called me about the forum in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| and asked me if I could be available the date she was trying to set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| Would that apply to this or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I mean, we didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| But, I mean, she did call me and just asked me if I would be available at the date to set the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| And is that the only conversation that you would identify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| As you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Same two questions basically for the new eight commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| Let's start in the first district with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Commissioner, let me read these questions again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Since September, I'm sorry, since February 20, 2008, have you discussed with another commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| outside a public meeting the items set on the next agenda for the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| or subjects within the jurisdiction or scope of responsibility of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Since February 20, 2008, have you discussed with another commissioner outside a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| items that can properly appear on an agenda of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| or subjects on which the county commission is empowered to act or advise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Same question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Same two questions, Commissioner Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Do you need for me to read those again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| The answer is no for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| No and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| No and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| I have never discussed anything with any of the other commissioners regarding anything I vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| But, yes, I did call Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| It was February 28, regarding the date for the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| But I was in contact with Mary Ann Stackhouse on that Friday, February 29, and disclosed it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:59| And she advised me that I, at the South Delaware Area Homeowners Association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| bring that up at the public meeting, which I did before the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| That was painless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| You don't need to get back to me and Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| I thought you said that or something, you'd get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| There will be an item on tonight's agenda where they will refer back to this conversation in an effort to cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:29| that violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| John, maybe you better make this a little clearer to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| I'm a little foggy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| But I thought the only thing we were talking about on this injunction were things that would come on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| that we were to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| I'll be glad to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:59| In accordance with TCA 844-106C, the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| and its members are permanently enjoined from further violation of TCA 844-101 at SEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| a.k.a. the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| More precisely, the Knox County Commission and its members are enjoined from engaging in any chance meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| informal assemblages, or electronic communications consisting of or between two or more members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| of the Knox County Commission for purposes of deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| or deliberating public business in circumvention of the spirit or the requirement of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:38| The court went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:51| It has been said that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| members of a public body may freely discuss their grandchildren, the price of a cruise, the weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| events occurring in the former Soviet Union, books and movies, their vacations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| and a host of other topics of interest to their personal lives or their professional lives, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| That comes out of a case by the name of Schwing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| They may not discuss, however, the items set on the next agenda for the public body on which they serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| nor subjects within the jurisdiction or scope of responsibility of the public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| Items that can properly appear on an agenda of the public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| and subjects on which it is empowered to act or advise are similarly forbidden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| for non-complying discussion by the members of the public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| When the topics for discussion and decision are such as would appropriately be addressed at a meeting of the public body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| then the Open Meetings Act is applicable to the subject matter of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| So what we find is that the court has really gone beyond deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6352)|
| 1:46:01| This body is permanently enjoined from a discussion of any kind of any matter that may come up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:11| So outside of a noticed public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| So Mr. Law Director read in the paper comments by the editor, comments by their attorney, Mr. Hollow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:28| and other people have opined, says, you know, commission can still get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| could still talk, commissioners could still talk to each other for informational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| and just sort of a gathering of just trying to learn what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| And it's the way I interpret it from what I originally read the opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| And what you've restated tonight is that those opinions are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| We are not allowed to talk to each other even for informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| We can't even say like Mr. Freese there wanted to know if Commissioner Pinkston was available for a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| on a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| And even that is a violation of the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| So we're enjoined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| No public discussion of, I mean, you must have public discussion of any matter that may come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| So we are a decision-making body that's forbidden to talk to each other outside of a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:37| That has been given proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Unless, as the court says, you want to talk about your grandchildren or what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Well, anything that could possibly be come before this at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| And that's the way I interpreted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| And that's the way I'm going to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Mr. Owings and I were in Nashville for an open meetings, an open records meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| And this issue was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| And if you ask members of the media, if you ask members of the Tennessee government, open government coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| they will tell you that discussion is not prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| And that's what they will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Also, members of the General Assembly will tell you that discussion is not prohibited under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| However, it was pointed out to us that we are under an injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| And because we are under an injunction, we are, quote, being punished by the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| And so, yes, the judge can and has established on us a rule that is not established on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| I don't believe, any other body in the state of Tennessee in terms of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| But this judge has seen fit to say, you cannot have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| And that's the injunction we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| And we have to abide by the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| I believe I'm correct on that, Mr. Lauder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| For how long are we under the injunction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Until the judge lifts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Well, we need to do this every six months for until he says it's no longer needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Are you going to try to get us out from under this injunction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Can he be compelled to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Now, Mr. Freeze called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Get a locket to get us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Mr. Freeze called me about a date for a public forum where I shouldn't be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| but she should be there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| And I believe all these other commissioners were invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| but she called mostly because in our district to see if I was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| And that was all that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| And it went public in the paper to tell we both would be there and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| But yet, still, that's a violation of the Sunshine Law for her to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| I think it could very possibly be, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| And as far as coming out from under the injunction, I don't mean to be short about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| We have this report to make and at least one more report that will be due October the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| I will not be here on October the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| There may come a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| That may be the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| But there may come a day, certainly, that this commission wishes to go back before the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| after it has demonstrated its compliance with the court's previous orders for relief from that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:27| But that will not occur, obviously, on my watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| Well, we can't apply to get out from under the injunction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| In my humble opinion, I don't believe that it would be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| Well, worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| Cut down on these meetings three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| You know, I just can't see the law being, I mean, this is a catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| And I can't see the law being this unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| Because, I mean, the way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| if I want to set up a public forum where I can talk to some fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| and the press can be present and the public can be present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| in the spirit of following the Sunshine Law, creating an open meeting, an open meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| if it gets to the point where I can't set up an open meeting without violating the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| when checking other commissioners' schedules, it's a catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| You can't set up an open meeting without violating the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| This is utterly ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Well, Commissioner Lambert, Commissioner Davis and I actually announced at 1.30 a.m. last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:55| that we were going to have our meeting, and you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| That's how we had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| We had to sit here and announce it so that anybody that wanted to come could stand here and listen to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| debate on what date met both of our schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| So you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| That's the only way you can do it is to have a public meeting and announce to the public that you're having that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| But if even to set the schedule, if folks need to talk to each other about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| if even to set that schedule, if I've got to wait until the next public meeting to set that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| if I can't even call and say, hey, I think we need to meet and talk about some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| are you available at 1 o'clock on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| And then, you know, they say yes, and I'm like, okay, I'll have it sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| If that in itself is a violation, this cannot be complied with unless we just come in here blind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| and we don't talk to anybody about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| And I don't think that's good for democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| I think that the spirit of the Open Meetings Act is to encourage debate in the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| where we discuss things in the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| not to get to the point where you can't make an appointment to discuss things in the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| without violating the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| I think this is utterly ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And what I plan on doing when I want to set up a meeting with some fellow commissioners to discuss things, what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| Go ahead and break the law, sunshine the event, and then cure the breaking of the law by saying, oh, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6804)|
| 1:53:32| you know that event that we had last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| I actually called some commissioners to make sure they were available then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| Is that the point that we're at with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| But we can, I mean, I don't want to go to jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| I mean, we can cure, if I discuss a meeting time with some commissioners, then sunshine the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:58| then I can cure the telephone call where I discuss the meeting times by talking about that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| I wouldn't count on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Commissioner, again, the key word here is we're being punished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| No other elected body in the state of Tennessee is under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| The city council members could probably call each other and set up a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| and that would not be considered a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| But because the judge and the jury said you folks were guilty, we're under this injunction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| and the judge is using this as punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| And so, and I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| I'm not disagreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| I'm just saying this is what we're under, and we have to abide by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| And at some point, we could probably go back to the judge and say, okay, we've learned our lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| We've complied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| Lift the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Well, I plan on going to the judge personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| I'll go sometime this week and talk to him, because this is absolutely crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| If I can't set up an open meeting without violating the Open Meetings Act, then the inmates are running the asylum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6891)|
| 1:54:58| I mean, this thing has gotten out of control, and it's absolutely crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| Commissioner Barrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| I don't know what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| Now, what if you do say we'll use Jolie to set up a meeting and call the other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| You can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| You're using the third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| That's what got us in trouble before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Well, somehow if we do it and the media doesn't show, can we go ahead and discuss with the group that we set it up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| As long as it's properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| The media doesn't have to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| The public doesn't have to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| As long as you've properly noticed the meeting or the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| So if you notice it with another commissioner for lunch or halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| It's done all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| But then you can talk about anything that comes open on the agenda or you limit it to what you read there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| I'm going to discuss items that may appear on the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| That's done all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| As long as it's sunshine or media noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| You've got to provide an opportunity for the public to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| How would you set it up by dinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| You can't set it up without violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Oh, one commissioner can call and set out a public notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| He says, like, Commissioner Ballard could call Commissioner Wright and say, I want to have lunch with you at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| So if Commissioner Ballard says, I want to have lunch with Commissioner Wright, he just sends out a press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| If Commissioner Wright shows up, they can have lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| If Commissioner Wright doesn't show up, he knows there was a conflict in schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| But if he can't make it, he can't call and tell them he can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| He can't call and tell them he can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| You're welcome to have lunch with another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| You just can't discuss public business unless you have properly noticed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| Can you go through a third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| But wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Now, if I can have lunch with another commissioner, so I can call a commissioner up and I can say, I can say, Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7012)|
| 1:57:00| why don't we meet for lunch to talk about fishing next Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| I can set that meeting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Can I then turn around and sunshine that meeting and then say, by the way, Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| I sunshine this meeting so we can talk public business if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| Have I found a way around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Not a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Well, and apologies to you, Mr. Chair, but I've set up a public meeting to discuss the eight amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:36| or this charter petition for next Monday, March the 31st at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| So I apologize if you can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| But the meeting has been set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| I just got confirmation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| Monday, March 31st at 630 at the Family Investment Center on the corner of Martin Luther King and Harriet Tubman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:59| I have my wedding anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Oh, you're kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| No, I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| You know, this was very confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| And I recall William Daniels and Elaine Davis meeting, but it was actually they met after adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| So does that consider a, I mean, even though they announced that they were going to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| it was after adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| So does that count or is that in violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Mary Ann told us to do that and how to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| So that's why we announced it to everyone after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| How did you get the advice then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| I got the advice after I contacted, see, I called Commissioner Pinks and see if the date was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| And then I proceeded and called Robert Bratton to see if the school was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And then I called Gene Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| Well, actually, no, I called the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| I talked to John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| And I said, who do I use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| He said, use somebody in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| So I called Gene Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| And then I contacted Jolie to let Jolie know when the date was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| So I made all these phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| And then that's when Jolie took it to Mary Ann that she said, you know, what all did you discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| And I said, no, I just discussed the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| I mean, honestly, I was just trying to do some public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| So, anyway, so I was just wondering how did you get, which one of you got the direction from Mary Ann to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| She was sitting right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| We asked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| How to handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| You used the key word, we asked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| She asked her and then I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| I know, but you both knew what that was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| At a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Mr. McKenzie, could you give us that time and date again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| And the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| Tank's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Is that Tank's house tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| That will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| We're fighting stakes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| Thank you, Commissioner Lutho, for your impeccable timing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| I was actually just asking the Knox County petition group, letting them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| But it's going to be Monday, March the 31st, at 6.30 p.m. at the Family Investment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:26| It's on the corner of Martin Luther King and Harriet Tubman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| It's at the Old Vine Middle School location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| Mr. John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Point of clarification, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Victor Jernigan, 108 Stacoya Lane, suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| On this issue of being the point person for somebody else, how does --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| I send out letters to all the commissioners and city council people whenever we're having a homeowner meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| or we're going to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| And I know most of the homeowner associations to which I attend have sent out letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| and invitations to the separate commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| Are we acting as point people to set up the meeting or whatever that third-party term was to set that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| I mean, we can sunshine the meetings, I guess, but the letters are going out to the commissioners from one source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| whether it be a homeowner association to invite commissioners to the meeting to see what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| or whether I'm sending them to invite the commissioners to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| It seems to me that this is getting to be a pretty gray area right there as to who can invite whom to where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:41| Are you asking me, Victor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| I'm asking somebody because it's a regular course of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| What you're talking about is sending a notice to the county commission office and saying that there's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| neighborhood meeting or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| And my suggestion is following that notice, if there are going to be commissioners present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| then there should be a public notice that goes out to allow the media and other persons in the public the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| to be there and hear the discussion, discussion among members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| Is it a situation where we shouldn't send the letters directly to the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| Send them to the county commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| I would think that it's working quite well if you're sending them to the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| and the commission is in turn sending out a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| So do we, would you say, issue the public notice first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| I mean, because I could really see this being a really gray area because I've been to several homeowner association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| where there have been several hundreds of people attending wanting to hear about a project maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| And several commissioners have been present in the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| So I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Hopefully it was a publicly noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| It was definitely a publicly noticed meeting, without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| I thought most of South Knoxville was invited to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| But the issue, in all sincerity, is the procedure with which this needs to be done as we're continuing to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:13| because zonings are going to be going on on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| In all sincerity, I am certainly concerned that the members of this body are subject to a $50 fine for each violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:27| or ten days in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| And so I wish for them to take the most restrictive way in order to participate in a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| and that is to make sure that they have provided a public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| and that the public and the media are invited to attend, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| That must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| So a public notice in all events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Quick question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| How do we insure ourselves when we get a letter from Mr. Jernigan that that process has taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| I mean, I may get a letter and say it's of interest to my district, and I show, do I call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| There needs to be a consistent process that each commissioner goes through to assure him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| or herself that we're going to a meeting and we're not going to be subject to these fines and imprisonments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Please let us know what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| Well, any one of you may call your employee in the commission office just to make certain that a proposed meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:34| a neighborhood meeting or event has been properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Is that a should or a shall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Well, that's a should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| And if I were you, I would make certain that it had been noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| Now, I know each of you receive faxes and you receive faxes or most of you receive faxes and a number of faxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:56| I receive the same ones that you receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| And there are any number of notices, public notices provided in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| Just make certain that every event that you wish to attend, that also there's another member of a body that may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:13| this body that may properly attend that is publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| That's the very least that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| A couple of more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| I'm really struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Commissioner Lambert, you're just beating a dead horse with me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| We've been through this and through this and through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| And the law is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| It is very clear in Knox County now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| It is very clear based upon what Chancellor Fanzler has ordered in his memorandum in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:44| You know, I don't know what else there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| We could debate it all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| Well, no, I'm not debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| I'm trying to find out what I can do legitimately to set up some open, sunshine conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:56| I think that it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Call the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Let them know that you're going to appear in this auditorium at a certain date and a certain time for discussion of any matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:06| that you please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Now, that's one way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| And invite other commissioners to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| So I can set up, say, maybe three lunches a week that I say I'll be at this place if anybody wants to show up and talk to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| And there may be other commissioners in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| And if a member of the public or a member of the media wishes to attend and listen in, they're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| And that will keep you in compliance with the judge's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| We have a motion on the floor for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| We're on page 14, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| This is reviewing the status of Sandra Elkins as Knox County medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| And the governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| And the governmental voted 6-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| And a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| I think the law director has some things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| I ask for this to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| I know Commissioner Briggs may have some comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| He talked about this somewhat at the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| But I wanted to bring you up to date on our situation with our Knox County medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| I provided each of you with a copy of the Knoxville Police Department crime report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| That crime report relates to an incident that occurred, I believe, at Dr. Elkins' residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:49| It is an incident that is of the utmost concern to not only this body, I'm certain, but it is to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7669)|
| 2:07:58| it is to the district attorney's office, and to others that are involved in our justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:11| I wanted to put this on the agenda for consideration perhaps next month to react to this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:24| to give Dr. Elkins the opportunity to appear either personally or through her attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:32| to answer questions about this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| Right now, the medical examiner is appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| And so the Knox County Commission may also revoke that appointment, presumably for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:59| I believe that what we have presented you through this crime report is certainly cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:09| that should be considered in the termination of Commissioner Elkins' relationship with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7749)|
| 2:09:17| I'm not Commissioner Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| I'm Commissioner Elkins, Dr. Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| And so that's what I wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| I wanted to bring the crime report to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| It is a matter that needs to be taken up at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| I would like to invite either she and or her attorney to appear at that meeting to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:44| this body's call for an explanation into the events that occurred at her residence on February the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:55| I believe it is, of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| It would be an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| Mr. Law Director, I'd like to add that either she appear before us or tender her resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| if she doesn't want to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Could you add that to the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| That was my same comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| I think if it's a no-show, then that should be for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| Well, I think, obviously, I think that's the way I would vote if she wasn't to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| I think in the letter, if she doesn't want to appear, that she do the honorable thing and go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| and tender her resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| But just to let her know that she's on notice, that we're asking her to do that if she doesn't want to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| I mean, it seems to me we should take action in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| It shouldn't be something that's just postponed another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| I think we need to act on it immediately, and I think we should try to find another examiner as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| So, because we're probably doing, we're having to do this without one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| We have an acting M.E., basically an assistant that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:18| And that assistant is performing a yeoman's job of that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7878)|
| 2:11:29| And this is a matter that I wanted to bring to you so I can write the appropriate letter to Dr. Elkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| and her attorney to see what she wishes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| But she has the right to come before this body to have an opportunity to respond to these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| to any questions that you may have about the incident that occurred at her residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:54| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| My question is, is it safe for her to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| I mean, obviously, according to this police report, this crime report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| there's some issues I would have with her possibly showing up in this public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| I mean, with the threats that were made, searching for a gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| I don't know that this would be the proper place for her to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| She can certainly appear through counsel if she's not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| I mean, we have metal detectors at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| But she would have, she probably has a parking pass and would come and park in the garage, come straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7954)|
| 2:12:41| Well, if that's a concern, we need to contact somebody with a parking card access list and determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:49| Yeah, and cut it off if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| It's a matter of three keystrokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| Mr. Law Director, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| Are you bringing this in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| I already have a motion, basically bringing it to your attention to discuss the status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| And I've heard from the commission tonight I will write a letter to Dr. Elkins through her attorney to see what it is they wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:21| With the added language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| With the added language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| But to come before this body next month or to tender her resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| Mr. Chairman, could we take about a five-minute break before we start on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| This is going to be very lengthy, I feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8026)|
| 2:24:16| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:32| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| If we could ask the commission if we could take a 30-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:59| If we could take 9-20 dealing with natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| They've got their people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| And before the county staff gets away, if we could deal with that issue next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Are there any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| You said 9-20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| It's a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| It's a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| This is a resolution authorizing and directing the Knox County Law Director to take any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8727)|
| 2:25:34| and all action necessary to terminate Knox County's contract with Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| LLC, for default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:48| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| Do you, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Well, I'd like to, since the contract is up for renewal, I think in July, to ask this contractor to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8752)|
| 2:26:03| with the contract, which they've signed, effective starting tomorrow until such time as county representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:15| and natural resources can come to some kind of an agreement on the contract and bring it back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| to see if we want to amend the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| But I think going forward, what's in the past is being litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| I think going forward, we want to make sure that our contracts are being complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| And if next month they come back with Bruce Weitrick and say that, you know, this isn't right, this isn't right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| and we need to amend the contract and we're going to take out parts of it, I think at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| the commission can decide if it's something that we need to take out or something that we need to leave in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:53| But I think the important thing is that they fall into compliance starting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| So I guess natural resources or their attorney, would you like to, is that something that's okay with you, Mr. Draper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8819)|
| 2:27:10| you and your attorney, I mean, you and your clients, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| Mr. Moore, when I spoke with you earlier today about this issue, there's another resolution, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:25| where you were wanting to add something to the purchasing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| I guess there are two resolutions that relate to the Greenway's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| I have stood before, I'm sorry, David Draper, 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| I've stood before this body before and shared with you, attempted to share with you the perspective of my client, the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:46| On Monday past, we had a workshop, which many of you were able to attend, some of you were not able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8866)|
| 2:27:53| Mr. Weitrich explained that there are issues on both sides of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8873)|
| 2:28:00| There are claims going in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| And the law director is aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| I think most of you are aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| I know that the law director on Monday at the workshop passed out a memorandum, a rather unprecedented memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:17| that indicated in effect that there were issues on both sides of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| I've never had a case before where in a public body the party on the other side of the contract stood up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:31| we're in breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| I guess all I would comment without attempting to get into all the specifics of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8914)|
| 2:28:42| and try to make a legal argument to you is that there are issues going in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| And the response of my client, quite rightly, would be if we're required to start doing something tomorrow under the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8927)|
| 2:28:56| we would, I think, fairly and rightly expect that Knox County would do things starting tomorrow under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8936)|
| 2:29:04| And that's really about the limit of my comment on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| Well, let me just add a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| You know, this came from our Knox County office of neighborhoods back in October of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| And, you know, natural resources have said that they haven't been doing what they've been promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| Their tons haven't been what they've been promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| And right here in a nice article about natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| they say in the past two years natural resources recovery has recycled more than 40,000 tons of Knox County's wood waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| into rich organic mulches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| Which then they turn around and say, well, we don't get but 4,000 or 5,000 tons, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:52| And right here is an article that was written by, I guess, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| I guess, Bruce, we've heard a lot about tonnage not being what we promised them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=8995)|
| 2:30:06| I haven't seen in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| And if you could point me to what part of the contract it says that we're going to guarantee them a certain amount of tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:15| It is not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| Oh, it's not in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| It is in the RFP, the proposal that we sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| Knox County talked about 15,000 tons of what was considered green waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| which is different from just wood waste in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| Green waste is typically what you would be dumping in your backyard or leaf cuttings and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| We didn't promise them anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| It is not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| It is the tonnages are not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| And have you verified when they've come back and said, you know, we haven't, you haven't gave us but 10 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9047)|
| 2:30:55| You promised us 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| Have you verified their numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| No, there's really not a direct way to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| When you come into the facility, essentially equipment is your weight as you come in, your weight as you go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| And through those tickets is how you determine tonnages that are coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| Well, I take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| You're not necessarily when you purchase something, you're not weighed as you go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| If you're purchasing something, they sell it on a cubic yardage basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| They bring it in on a tonnage basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| So if I bring a dump truck load of something, then that is weighed and that's tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:28| And if I buy something, it's done on a cubic yardage basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| So, members of the commission, that's why I think it's important that the commission holds people responsible for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:40| contracts in which they sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| And if there's something that needs to be worked out through public works, engineering, the new solid waste director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:51| then bring it back next month and tell us what these need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| If it's something that's legitimate that the commission thinks should be changed, then we ought to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9116)|
| 2:32:04| But to have someone out of compliance with a contract and we continue to let it go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| I think it just shows that anybody that wants to say anything about the contract they hold in Knox County would just be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:21| If we don't have something to hold someone's feet to the fire when they sign a contract with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| what good is the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| Let me make sure you understand one thing I need to point out is certainly the tonnages are not in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9146)|
| 2:32:31| but Knox County's commitment to open another facility at the Forks River Industrial Park is in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| And to do a facility where we're going to be taking biosolids, which is what was intended in the contract, it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:45| first off, I don't think it's practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| I don't want to open up another facility if I have an odor issue at the existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| That's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| The second thing is the expense that would have to go into actually getting the site ready for that type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| That never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| What number is that in the contract, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| I think you just have to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| I don't know exactly what number is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| It's only 25 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| The county committed to provide them with a second facility at the Forks River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| And that never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| I think it's referenced in the memo that Mr. Owens' office put out in regards to this matter also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| That, I believe, is in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| And we have never complied with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| And I certainly would not recommend us complying with it for a couple of reasons, odor being one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| And, secondly, the expense involved in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| So why would we have got into a contract that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| and the engineering solid waste people never intended to comply with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| I don't think on the onset it was their intention not to comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| I think because of circumstances that evolved with dealing with the solid waste facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| it was deemed not a good idea and financially feasible to then open up a second facility at Forks River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:56| It was not foreseen when we did the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| We didn't enter into it with the intention of not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| But when I had problems with the ponds at the solid waste facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| I had to divert funds that we would have used to prepare the Forks River site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| I had to use those at the solid waste site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| So the funding mechanism essentially went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| Secondly, because we never really got this odor issue completely solved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| I didn't feel it was advisable to now open yet a second facility to experience somewhat of the similar problems that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| at solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| So it wasn't on the onset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| It was just evolved over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| That's how it ended up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| I'm still, can anyone tell me in the 25 terms of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| Mr. Law Director, if you want to step in, or Bruce, or Mr. Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| I don't have a copy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| Well, I've got a copy right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Which part of this contract right here, if you want to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| says that we're going to open up a second facility at the Forks River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| It's somewhere on the first page, I think, towards the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| It says you'll expand, stabilize, permit the Forks River site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9300)|
| 2:35:09| I mean, it's abundantly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| Well, it's abundantly clear, Mr. Draper, but do you not have a permit at the Forks River site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| To how the animal waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| We do not have a permit that would allow us to do the same type of operation we have at the Forks River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| excuse me, at the solid waste site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| We cannot do a biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| There are certain things we can do at the Forks River site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| but we cannot do the same type of operation that's being done at the solid waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| We do have a permit by rule that allows us to do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| I cannot take biosolids on that facility and be in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| We would be in because of the conditions of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| I cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| Well, it doesn't say that we shall do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| It says including without limitation biosolids, manure, food waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| You can do manure, can't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| I cannot do biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| No, but it doesn't say that you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| It says including without limitation biosolids, manure, food waste, and other organic feedstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| Well, I guess our interpretation of the contract was that we were going to provide a facility similar to what they had at Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| with the proper permits at the Forks River, and that clearly never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| So that was our interpretation of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| I may be incorrect of the interpretation, but that's how we've always interpreted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| Mr. Law Director, on Section 2B of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| does it say that Knox County will let them do biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| or it will let them do biosolids or manure or food waste and other organic or organic feedstocks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:43| Including without limitation biosolids, manure, food waste, and other organics or other organic feedstocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:51| And they do have a permit to do the manure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| and they never asked for any other permit as I understand it through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| The question is, do we have a permit to do what it is that they are doing at Solway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| And the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| And the answer to that is we're not going to seek a permit for that because of all the issues involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:18| So what does this right here tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| It tells us that they aren't able to do the same things that they are able to do by permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| through the permits that we have obtained at Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| It is not the same type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| Well, I mean, we've argued over it and discussed it for the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| And I think it's to have professional people in place to oversee these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| And we're asking taxpayers to pay more taxes in certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| And we're letting a company for over five years be out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| I don't know what that says for Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| but certainly to me as a commissioner I want to hold these people's feet to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| and make them comply starting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| If there's a reason why the solid waste director sees a need to amend the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9486)|
| 2:38:14| then he needs to amend it and bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| But certainly to allow these people to continue to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| and not do what they say in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| I just don't see where that says anything good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| Two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| One, unrelated to the discussions we've had thus far, in the workshop on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| I made a statement with regard to the bond that I had a remembrance of Mr. Myers telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9514)|
| 2:38:42| that the bond had been released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| That was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9526)|
| 2:38:47| There was a letter of credit that was issued that expired by its terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| That's just a fact I did not recollect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| Certainly Mr. Myers did not release the bond, and I want this body to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| I don't think it really is pertinent to what we're discussing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| but I felt the need to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| Number two, with regard to tons and stats, you have to recognize that we were invited in here to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9546)|
| 2:39:14| to develop a business model back in 2003 to make a proposal to Knox County on how its recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9554)|
| 2:39:22| green waste recycling operation could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| And the RFP, which is a part of the contract, provided that we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| that Knox County had already processed 15,000 tons of organic waste before we came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| And the contract document that you have, the RFP states that we expect this to double and possibly triple, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:49| My client built a business model based on an expectation, a conservative expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9589)|
| 2:39:55| of 20,000 tons of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| And it has never shown up at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| And there are representations in the contract about the amount of organic material we would be receiving as the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| and it has never shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| We have gotten a fraction of the amount of material that Knox County told us in the contract addendum that was issued 11 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| before the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| They said that they would bring us 2,500 tons of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| They told us Oak Ridge would bring us 5,000 tons of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| 7,500 tons a year just from government bodies, and it has never shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9631)|
| 2:40:37| It's about 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| Don't hold me to that, but it's roughly 40 percent of what we were told it would be five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:46| And this is a part of the issues that we have that come back in the county's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| So if it's your collective sentiment, as the resolution reads, that we should be put in default tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9653)|
| 2:41:01| then I'm just telling you that we have legitimate issues that come back in the direction of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| that have to be answered for, and that's fair and that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:12| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Commissioner Moore, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| I see your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| For the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| I was going to bring up that we should just rebid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| It's over in June, at the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| But I understand now that it has been, it's being rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| Asking them to, and I agree with what you're saying, Commissioner Moore, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| They should be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| They should have always been in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| I mean, I guess we should have always been in compliance if that's what they're countering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| But to say start bidding compliance tomorrow is, I think, sort of redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| I think there's a lawsuit going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| It's going to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| And we just need to go ahead and take in the bids, figure out who the best bidder is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:14| Remember, when we approve the contract, happens to be this company that's recommended before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:22| if we wish to continue on with the new contract with them and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9742)|
| 2:42:28| But at this point, you know, there's a lawsuit going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| And to tell them to start bidding compliance when they should have been in compliance from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| I think is a little redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| But I do agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| I wish they would get in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| But, you know, let's rebid this thing and let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| And we'll let the attorneys and, you know, hash out who owes what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| because that's what's going to happen anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| I'll get with you, Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| Chairman, if you don't mind, go ahead and get the other two lights on that side, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| I'd like you to come back to me when they finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| I've got a rotation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| Of course, you know, I've always called this the Mushroom Commission because we never get any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9796)|
| 2:43:22| But in June of 2007, I want to read this paragraph to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| Now, therefore, it be resolved the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| The commission of Knox County hereby respectfully requests that Mayor Ragsdale conduct a review of a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9813)|
| 2:43:41| with Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| to determine whether Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9829)|
| 2:43:56| Prepare a report of this findings and submit said report to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| within 90 days of the passage of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| And make recommendations to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| including whether further odor abatement measures are necessary and available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| Now, he was asked to find if we were in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| He came back, this was in June, in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| and John Owens, I've got the tape of the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| If you all want it, you can get it from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| He asked for John Evans, I mean, instead of John Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| He was going to let him speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| And they stood at that podium there and told us these people were in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| And we haven't received one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:40| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| If anybody would like to look at this, I'll be sure to pass it around to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| And I'd like to refute one of the statements that was just made in clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9890)|
| 2:44:56| The RFP did say that in last year approximately 15,000 tons of green waste were processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| This includes 5,000 tons a year of yard waste collected through an intergovernmental agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| with the city of Oak Ridge and transported to the solid waste site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| It did not give any guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| Knox County believes the potential exists to at least double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| or possibly triple that tonnage, 15,000 tons, over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:24| In the very next sentence, they tell you how they're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| They didn't say the tonnage of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| They said tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| The very next sentence says, Knox County recently completed a biosolids composting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| co-composting demonstration with several local wastewater utility districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| The utilities and state regulators expressed an interest in potential long-term operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| When you compare the data that was turned in to our state recycling coordinator for the past several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:53| when you combine their green waste with their biosolids, the average comes out to about 30,000 tons a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:59| That's double the 15,000 tons represented in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| Furthermore, through every record, every Department of Neighborhood pamphlet like Scott Moore has read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:10| articles in the New Sentinel, state recycling data, everything I can find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| I'm yet to find a single solitary document that reported less than 16,000 tons of green waste into those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9975)|
| 2:46:23| for any given year of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| And John Evans did tell them that they didn't need to pay this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9986)|
| 2:46:32| and so did Bruce Weitrick, agrees with him here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| But did they make that statement on the belief that they were only receiving 10,000 tons a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:41| Because if they did, I don't believe those numbers to be accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| and I believe I have sufficient data to prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| But I'd like to end with one quick note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| Anybody who does business with a county government, anybody who contracts with a government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10015)|
| 2:47:02| knows that you can't change a contract on a handshake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:07| And everybody in this entire situation knows that John Evans did not have the authority to change this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10027)|
| 2:47:16| And everybody involved with this knows that not only did he not have the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| but he didn't have the ability to put it in writing if he wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| And the question that I have is, if we're going to allow this to happen, we're setting a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10046)|
| 2:47:35| where any Knox County employee, even though they have no jurisdiction over a contract's negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| can tell someone not to pay, and that's just okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| And if that's the case, I'm going to ask Lumpy tonight, do I have to pay property taxes anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| And if he says no, I've got all of y'all as witnesses that I don't have to pay them no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| That's the exact same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| You're not going to hear that from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10079)|
| 2:48:00| I wish I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Well, I thought my chances were good with you, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:05| I'm against taxes, but I want to cut them across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| Well, folks, I think it's safe to say that anyone who does government contracts, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10089)|
| 2:48:14| knows you can't verbally change these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| Well, someone who obviously doesn't have the authority with a handshake or in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10097)|
| 2:48:23| And this is also evident in a memo sent from John Evans to Natural Resources back in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:32| where he states that Knox County is to receive a portion of the revenue from outbound sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| Up until now, we have not exercised that, and I expect to receive some heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| Now, in their intercommunications, if he's telling them I'm expecting to receive some heat for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| that's a pretty good indication that everybody involved knew that this was not a legitimate deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10128)|
| 2:48:54| Anybody who does government contracting knows you can't do it this way legitimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| and it's my position that the only reason this wasn't brought back before this council is because they knew they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| couldn't get it in writing because we would fact check to see if their claims for not paying are legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10143)|
| 2:49:10| Now, there's been a lot of statements made about not getting their permit for two years, which turned out to be inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:16| I'm not going to go through all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| We'll be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| I'm going to make this short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| There's been a lot of claims, and I can disprove a lot of those claims as being inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10161)|
| 2:49:26| And I think that one of the most telling signs of this is the fact that they have had a similar dispute over non-payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10166)|
| 2:49:36| of yardage in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| Folks, I am a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| And that's been used to discredit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| But I ask you, would you expect a florist to catch these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| It would take another mulch man to understand the business enough to catch these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| And I am a competitor, and I don't have a degree, and I'm not qualified to interpret a lot of the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| and the scientific evidence involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| And I'll admit, I'm not qualified to interpret it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| but the state of Tennessee was when they caught them selling contaminated products last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10203)|
| 2:50:10| The city of Louisiana or the city of Baker was qualified when they sent letters to the state of Louisiana asking them not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10210)|
| 2:50:17| to give them permits in their own hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| Knox County is not a competitor, and they were a neutral party when they sued them for this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10220)|
| 2:50:28| You know, there's a lot of T-DEC was a neutral party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10228)|
