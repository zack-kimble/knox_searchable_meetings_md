| 0:01:00| possible if you plan to attend either of those events. And as most everyone knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| our 2021 commencement ceremonies were finalized yesterday and I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| take a moment to congratulate our graduates once again and thank you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| the team who worked so hard on those graduations and to Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| who attended all those graduations and and we're happy that we have graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| everyone and wish all our graduates all the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Any, well first before I ask for any changes to the agenda I wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| sure board members that you, remind you that you received an email today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| regarding agenda item 8A. As Ms. Owen requested at last week's work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| this item regarding a new proposed policy on IEP meeting recordings has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| been withdrawn and moved back to the policy review process. Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Thomas and I agreed to move that to policy review and I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| several public forum speakers on this topic tonight and so we'll have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| comments at the end of the meeting during public forum. Are there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| We have a motion to approve. Thank you. We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| by Ms. Christie. Any discussion? All in favor? Any opposed? Motion carries. And now I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| would like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for a very special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you Madam Chair, members of the board. I do appreciate the chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| recognize an important leader and partner within our district. As you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Tonya Coates is the president of Knox County Education Association and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| about to step down from that position after serving two consecutive terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| along with the previous term that ended in 2015. Tonya is a longtime educator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| with Knox County Schools and has served as a teacher, an instructional coach, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| a curriculum facilitator since joining us in 1999, but I have worked most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| closely with Tonya in her role as president of KCEA where I have gotten to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| know her as a strong, passionate, and effective advocate on behalf of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| County teachers. During her tenure, Tonya has shaped numerous policy decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| before the board, but I do want to highlight three that are particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| meaningful. She played an essential role in establishing the Minority Advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Council which helps ensure the KCS benefits from a diversity of viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| and supports a positive culture for all employees. Tonya has also been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| instrumental in navigating the collaborative conferencing process which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| for the last decade has shaped how the Board of Education works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| collaboratively with our teachers. Her leadership has helped make KCS a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| for the state of Tennessee in this regard. And finally, she's been a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| advocate for employee salary increases at Knox County Schools and this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| have implemented during two of the last three budget cycles. Actually, we met the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| MOA Memorandum of Understanding goal twice now, I guess within the last three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| years, and that had never been met before, so I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| incredible. And I'll say that many of these issues can be challenging and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| don't always agree, but while Tonya has never been hesitant to offer constructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| criticism to me or share concerns, she's never adversarial and I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| good working relationship we have shared as we seek to do what's best for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| students and our teachers. Tonya has been a great partner for our district and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| advocacy is also felt statewide as the Vice President of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| Education Association. I anticipate that we will hear much more from her as she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| exercises leadership within that organization in the future, so please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| join me in recognizing Ms. Tonya Coe. So, Tonya, if you would come up front and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| would like to invite the entire board to come with me and get a picture with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Tonya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=302)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=324)|
| 0:05:54| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=354)|

| 0:07:16| Now, I have the privilege of recognizing our student rep, Ms. Abigail Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| The board and Superintendent Thomas want to take this opportunity to recognize our current Board of Education student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=442)|
| 0:07:32| Saying that Abigail has served on the board during a very challenging year is certainly an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| With many of our students attending school virtually, school events being limited, quarantines, and even a few school closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| she was presented with difficulties that no other student rep had to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So, thank you, Abigail, for your flexibility, for your dedication and commitment during such a difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=469)|

| 0:19:11| Miss Babb, do we have public forum on this one? We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| First, I have Erin Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| If you'll come forward, state your name and county of residence and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| Erin Keck, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| I want to address this agenda item about the use of the facilitator for law enforcement memorandum of agreement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1171)|
| 0:19:41| I apologize. I didn't know I'd be first. I've got to get my papers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| I think it is a good idea to have a neutral facilitator conduct community input meetings related to the current Knox County Schools MOA with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1185)|
| 0:19:56| I've been told by both school administrators on various levels that law enforcement, and when I say law enforcement, I want to specify SRO, SSO, KPD, or KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1196)|
| 0:20:09| When I say law enforcement, I mean all of those entities as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| I've been told by school administration on various levels that law enforcement does not handle discipline in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| I've heard from students and parents that this is not always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Why would we not revisit this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| It's not just the tragic death of Anthony Thompson Jr. in his high school's bathroom that creates the need for this revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| I have here the letter two years ago that was written to this board and signed by ten different groups in this organization about this very MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1235)|
| 0:20:44| I'm sure you read it then, so I'm not going to read it all to you, but there are three of the points that they had for consideration as issues that I want to bring back up again two years later and maybe reflect on those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1244)|
| 0:20:55| One was training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| As written in the agreement, it allows police officers to serve in our schools up to a year before being trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| No officer should serve around our school children until they're fully trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Another one, this MOA affects parents and students that there has been no public meeting or explanation of the purposes and implications of this MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| Also, the school system has individuals who are trained in trauma crisis intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| These individuals may often be the best place to de-escalate student crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| However, the agreement as drafted may require school officials to request law enforcement intervention even if these trained individuals have a situation under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1292)|
| 0:21:43| Now, with these community meetings, you would not need to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| The Knox County Education Coalition recently shared this really helpful handbook, a parent's checklist for SROs in children's schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| And again, I certainly am not going to read all of this to you as you're fully capable, but the Executive Director for the Strategy of Youth on her opening page explained the purpose and use of these, and I just want to read a short snippet of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1318)|
| 0:22:12| Routinely, we find that parents are not aware of the scope of officers' authority, and officers are not aware of what parents have been told about law enforcement's role in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1332)|
| 0:22:23| This causes anxiety, confusion, and at times produces significant problems that are hard to resolve and cast a shadow over school climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1343)|
| 0:22:34| I have an extra copy if anybody here would like to take one home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| So, in summary today, I just want to express again, we desperately need to have community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| We've been told in these meetings before that the current MOA came about from incidents that happened in other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| Sandy Hook, Columbine, tragic events that happened and made us want to revisit what we're currently doing here in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| But this year, a tragic event happened in Knox County school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Why does that not create a need for us to revisit this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| There's confusion with who's in charge of what, and as I told you guys last week when I was here, it's affected me and my family personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| I know that some of you expressed concerns about a focus group and that perhaps community members that came and spoke out at community groups might face a negative backlash in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1397)|
| 0:23:27| While that's a valid concern, I would first want to say, you have my information and I'd be happy to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And second, if the parents and adults aren't the ones speaking out, then we leave it to our school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| And I don't think that's the right way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| My child might not come and express concerns to me again after what happened to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I hope that everyone else's children feel comfortable coming to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| But it's our responsibility as parents and adults in this community to look at what is actually best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| That's all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Michael O'Malley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| And if you will state your name and county of residence and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Okay. Michael O'Malley, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| I'm a teacher at Carter High School, but I'm sharing my own opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| They don't necessarily reflect my school or colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| But I'm here to ask you to use an external facilitator as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| You may remember at the May work session that I spoke in favor of community input, and I still am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| And since then, I have been following this issue closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| And honestly, I don't really understand why the use of an external facilitator has become a point of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Based on last week's work session, it seems that there may be some misconceptions about what a facilitator would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| As I understand it, a facilitator would not be presenting a new MOA, which was one of the concerns mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Nor would it be overriding the board's ability to create a new MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| My understanding is that the facilitator would simply be someone to officiate public meetings used to gather community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| And this seems like a reasonable and prudent feature to have at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| A good external facilitator can come into a situation to ease tensions, which there have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| help identify points of agreement and disagreement, and provide objective summaries of long meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| Most importantly, a third-party facilitator can provide an atmosphere of neutrality in these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| which is essential when this project hinges on public trust in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| At last week's work session, several board members said that the public has no reason to mistrust the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| I'm afraid that the very way that this whole process of the MOA revision discussion has unrolled over the past month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| has presented exactly the sort of behavior that breeds mistrust, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| I am sure that none of the board members' intention is to create mistrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| But as someone who has watched or attended all of the meetings related to this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I have seen several things that, from my perspective as a frustrated member of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| could have already seeded mistrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So first, at the very beginning when this subject was initially brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| several board members expressed concerns about the logistics of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| which Mr. Watson then addressed by revising the resolution that he eventually brought to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| only to have those same board members vote against the resolution anyway on a technicality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| that the issue should not have been brought as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Would the public trust board members to lead community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| when they cannot, in good faith, problem-solve with their own colleagues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| Much less members of the public, who may bring much more stark disagreements to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Secondly, at a follow-up meeting on May 19th, the board collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| maybe not unanimously, but collectively agreed to seek a third-party facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| for the community engagement, only to have that decision put up for debate again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| at the work session last week on the basis of a letter from Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| which is now what this agenda item is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| In response to this letter, some members of the board changed their tune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| regarding finding a facilitator, and this is not an isolated incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Time and again, this board's discussion about community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| have centered on talking points originating not from the actual proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| brought by board members, but from statements made by influential local leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| If the board cannot keep external pressures, and pressures I might add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| from figures with no jurisdiction over board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| from shaping their actions in the highly curated environment of a board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| would the public trust board members to facilitate impartially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| in the inevitably more chaotic environment of a community meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Several members of this board have also at multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| throughout the past month said that they already know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| how their districts feel about the issue of school security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| but surely no member of this board has talked to every constituent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| and public meetings can bring different people than those who might call or email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Relatedly, I know people who live or teach in these districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| and the way that these board members have summarized their district's feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| do not always represent the emails or calls that they have already sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| to these board members on the subject at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| One board member last work session even revealed that he didn't even remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| a mother who had come and spoken to this very body a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| about the mistreatment of her autistic son by police in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Would the public trust board members to lead community meetings fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| when some board members' statements indicate that they have already forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| or ignored large swaths of their constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Fourthly, furthermore, at several points in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| some board members have already stated specific ideas and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| that they would not even consider putting into the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Would the public trust board members to lead community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| when some board members have made it clear that some meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| or some ideas that people might bring will be automatically discarded at those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Lastly, the board has spent over a month now deliberating on the basic question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| of whether or not to engage the public at all, and if so, how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| We've not even gotten anything concrete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Carefulness is good, but after a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| such debating over the minutia of the most basic part of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| begins to look like obstruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| And whether or not that is the intent, this board is running the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| of delegitimizing this project in the eyes of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| by implying that it doesn't want to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Would the public trust board members to lead community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| if they suspected that the Board of Education did not actually want to hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| It seems like a completely reasonable reaction to any of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| would be to sidestep any possible mistrust by hiring an outside facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| to be the face of these meetings rather than the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| who have already spoken quite a bit over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| I just want to make sure I'm not missing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| I believe that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| I'm so sorry. I knew I was like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I'm sorry, Mr. Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I was like trying to be careful, and I overlooked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| You know I do not want to ignore you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| She didn't do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| If you will state your name, county of residence, and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| I live on Foster Lane in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I want to thank all of you for putting in the time that you already have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| on the idea of expanding the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| As most of you know, this was brought before the board a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| complete with printed materials, examples of other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| and citizens speaking in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Hopefully, its time has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| I will also correct the county mayor and his statements in his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Expanding the MOA means that law enforcement will be in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| not kicked out of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| This is not about getting rid of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| It seems to be used a whole lot to cause more anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| in the discussions I've seen over the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| What is needed is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| There are schools across the country that are realizing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| We need an MOA which clearly defines protocol and policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and communication between the school itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and any action that an officer might feel he has to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| or that he may be asked to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Obviously, most of the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| are there to protect the school building and personnel and kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| from bad actors with deadly intent from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Now, we have designated intervention staff in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and there are certainly not enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| but that is improving, it sounds like, with next year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| and that's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| School systems and parents realize that there has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| a clear line drawn between what the school resource staff will handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| when a pupil is having a bad day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| and what law enforcement might be called on to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Parents want to know how quick they will be contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| when their child is having a really bad day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| The principal wants to know what is their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| when trouble arises and law enforcement might be the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| All these things seem new to us in Knox County, but not in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| There were good discussions in the two meetings of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| that I have attended about the ideas of how this expansion of the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| could get input from parents, teachers, and staff of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| Most of us have lived long enough to know that a neutral party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| is much better at facilitating how these hearings in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| and districts might be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| especially because of the polarization that seems to be happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| about police officers in school or not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| It's going to take some time for that to dissipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| It is very difficult, if not possible, to get good feedback from the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| if the organizers of the meetings are the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| and district supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| No offense meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| These people who I just listed are also able to speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| at a neutral meeting and speak their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| which is very important for us to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| So please, let's get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| This is not political. It's gotten too political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| This is about our kids, the safety of the kids in school, and the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| That now concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And I'll also just note that Superintendent Thomas did speak with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| meet with Mayor Kincannon, and I think they have another meeting on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| So just so that everybody is aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Superintendent Thomas, do you mind just kind of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| a little bit of information on how the meeting went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and what the plan is for Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Do you know any insight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| And thank you for the opportunity to speak to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| And it was a very good meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Mayor Kincannon and some of her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| also Mr. Oaks and Mr. Chief Producers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| and Mr. McPherson attended the meeting with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| And we had an opportunity to talk with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| about the importance of the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| in the school, SROs, as well as our SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Mayor Kincannon, I would say, listened very intensely at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| and had some very good questions about what does an SRO do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| that an SSO can't do, and what does an SSO do that an SRO can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| I just wanted a better understanding of how that partnership worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And it was a very good discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| And again, say the mayor was very, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| in terms of listening and asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| she was very forthcoming with the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| that I think we answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| And the commitment she made to us at the end of that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| was that she would like to have another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| in the near future, and she would get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| And she has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I think we met, was it last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| With graduations, the days are running together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| So anyway, we have a meeting Tuesday morning, another meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| and looking forward to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And I'm sure she probably has talked with her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| and we've talked a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| So any other questions that the mayor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| that we can provide answers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| certainly willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| But I would say it was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And again, she listened very intensely and carefully, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| and asked some very good questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| that hopefully we provided answers to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| that she was help needing to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Mr. Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| the mayor, Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| is a very good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| We both remember her when she was on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| She's highly intelligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| But I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| did you hear anything from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| that would lead you to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| that she and the KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| who she has control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| would want to participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| I guess the fact that she wanted to have another meeting in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| tells me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| hey, I'm thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| I didn't get a yes, didn't get a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| But I did get a commitment to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| hey, I want to look at this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| I did impress upon her that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| you know, for planning purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| we need a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And absent of a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| then we'll have to take other steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| to try to make sure that we have coverage in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And I did just have a brief conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It's just to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I put him kind of on notice from a standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| If we don't have school resource officers from KPD in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| can we meet with you and Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| and try to formulate a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| to make sure that we have coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| So my intent is not to let this lie dormant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| School's going to be starting before we know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| and we need to have a plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| reassurance to parents and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| that the officer, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| is going to be, that will be in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| So my best explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Well, I don't think we can let it lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| for a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| while the mayor makes up her mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| She's a very intelligent lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| and my guess would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| she knows now whether she wants to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| and to what level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Or at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| to a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| If she did participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| she might decide to go beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| from your perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| if she does not say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and put something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| she's unwilling to put something in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| on Tuesday or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| to the effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| that the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| will participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| then we should move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I'm sure you made it clear to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| but I want you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| from my standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I would appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| if you tell her this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Either you decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| when I walk out of this room today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| wherever you meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| either yes you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| or no you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| If you don't say yes you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| then we will assume the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I'm still very much in support of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| facilitator to be that third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| and a neutral third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| to hear stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| people's stories, people's experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| and to help improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| well, I know feedback is the surest way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| of gaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| improving any situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| We're having a new chief of security come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| that I'm really excited about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and I commend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Superintendent Thomas for making that hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| because from the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| it seems like a great fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| but he's also coming into a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| that he doesn't know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| This alone is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| as a system to prepare a new hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| to be as successful as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| in their new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That's an angle that could be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Another angle that could be supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| is that we don't hear from students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| in their experience at all, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| We hear from parents a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| we hear from just community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| but we never hear a student's voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| or student's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| in any of our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| That's the angle that can be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| The fact that we did have a tragedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| should be enough to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| and not even just in a sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| creating the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| but what are people's stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| and experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| as they figure out a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| to improve the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| and what we do in our trainings, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| We do have KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| we have Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| They make a small percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| of officers in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| We have over 100 of our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| in-house people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| that work in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I'm sure they can give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| some feedback on how things are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| what's going well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| and areas of improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| That's the angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| The rhetoric of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| not using taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| is not something that I fully believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I do ask those that are in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| if you could tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| if you feel comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| you don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| why you don't want to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I heard Mr. Mike loud and clear last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| and while I don't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I respect the honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| If you all could share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| why this is not an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| that will help me figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| the next perspective I can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I do try hard to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I get Mr. Mike's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| respect it, and we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| I don't believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| the amount of money for facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I don't believe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| but maybe it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| If you don't mind sharing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| in opposition as to why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I don't want to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| in assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I want to fully understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Yeah, I also am in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| and I've already said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| of a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Honestly, I left last week's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| and went home and really started thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| about if we don't use facilitators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| how would I personally go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| trying to get the input I wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| I think I'm a fairly smart person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| but I'm not trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| in how to get community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Yes, I do think we have some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| in Knox County schools that could help with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but I started thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I want the questions asked in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| the same questions asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| in Ms. Satterfield's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| and Mr. McMillan's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| I want us to kind of have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| the same conversations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| which I think then could be led by facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| because I really kind of felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| a little overwhelmed leaving last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| when I thought, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I feel so responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| which is kind of what the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| from Mayor Jacobs was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| was like we're capable as school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| of handling this and I don't feel capable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I mean, I will do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| and I will figure out a way with integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| to try to get a lot of input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| and get a lot of input from a lot of different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| which is what I want to hear from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| but I would feel a lot more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| with a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| With that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I do think this is an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| that is a dilemma of being told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| possibly one thing by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| and another thing by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and I just think we do need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Whether it passes or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I think we just need to give clarity to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| so I would hope that at the end of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| we can make a motion to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, Ms. Pab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah, well, like I said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I really don't have strong feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I mean, I think we need to have the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| and I would like to hear thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| on how that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| would take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| without a facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| in a transparent way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I guess my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| with having a facilitator now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| seems to be that that's become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| as polarizing as the discussion itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| It's like we keep getting hung up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| on little pieces of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| not seeing the force for the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| if we debate this piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| we're not going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And, you know, there are concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| that on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| there will be critics of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| you got an outside facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| to steer the discussion in one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| or there will be concerns of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| you didn't get a facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| because you wanted to steer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| the conversation in another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| and I just feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| the topic itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| is so polarizing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| we're just getting hung up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| on the little details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| but I would like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| the ideas or plans moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| if we aren't going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I know Google Docs was mentioned as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| you know, but who would manage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| where would we go from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| without one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| and do we have the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| to handle that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| I mean, I think we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I agree with Ms. Babb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| that we do need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| but I guess one problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| that I have with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| I have more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| but one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| you said you'd feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| more comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| if we were to have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| whoever the facilitator is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| will direct the show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| and they will control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| how far it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| how long it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| unless we set a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| and I still don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| that we gain anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| by hiring somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| but I want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| why you would feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| much more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| what you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| that person could bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| change our opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| change our opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| I just see where I see it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| I would like someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| who looks at the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| who kind of deals with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| I mean, I've done some facilitation myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I mean, like, I've gone and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| but it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| like somebody coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| with the good questions to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| coming up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| who are we trying to draw in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| to ask of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| and I just started thinking about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I mean, if I personally am responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| for my district in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| if we're not hiring a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| I started thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| how do I get in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| with a wide variety of students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| How do I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| and I mean, I can do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| I mean, I really can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| It just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| I do think they're just people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| that are trained to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| and I mean, it's their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| and they come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| I mean, I kind of have two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| I mean, I'm a school board person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| I'm a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I can try to come up with figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| how to facilitate meetings in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| but I'm not a professional at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and I'm going to admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| that that's not in my wheelhouse of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| and I just think there are people better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| So it's not that I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| And that I'm not willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I just think there are people that are better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| They would be hired to take this on and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| and I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| I do think it's in our control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| to sort of set some deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| and I do think that was one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| that kind of came up in the mayor's discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| was that this would just go on for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I think we have it in our control to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| we want this done in X amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| and I mean, it's got to be a realistic time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| to do some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| What do you envision as an amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| We're just going to discuss this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| say we left this meeting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| and decided to hire a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Well, then next week you'd have to look into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| and so then we're probably getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| 1st of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| with someone trying to start doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| I think like 90 days or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Three months is probably a reasonable amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| but once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| I think that's one of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| you have to have a conversation with people, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| we'd like to do something in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Is this reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| They can let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I don't think any of us are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| for something to drag on for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| but that's just my opinion on it, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I'm not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| I'm just bringing my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| kind of what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| and there are some similarities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| with communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| the people that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| larger communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3007)|

| 0:50:12| and the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| contributory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3014)|

| 0:50:16| the Carter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and the people in Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| they share some of the same values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| that the people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| and Rocky Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| and places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| you represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| in West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| but West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| is entirely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| from either of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| my two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Sure, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| And you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| But I just think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| it's not the amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| although,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| once you start down that pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| you could ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| involve more groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| I'm not so sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| that you would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| any better off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| making the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| It's like my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| told me one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| It may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| but at least you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| And there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| there's some validity in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Sure, we all make wrong decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| we were elected to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| and I don't want anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| to take this personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| but if you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| take this to the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| of where you're willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| determine what needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| without a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| I really don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| that's one of the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| how well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| you can represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| I don't think we've heard yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| if we don't have a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| how do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| as nine individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| accurately collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| and report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| from our communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| What system do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| to go into our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| and be able to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| all that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| aggregate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| and then report it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I don't know of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| we have that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Let me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| As I'm thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| we certainly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| some very difficult situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| that we're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| and that we know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| that have happened in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| We've heard of two recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| that have come before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| that we've spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| are you hearing other concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| that we haven't heard of collectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| I would say yes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| and I will also say yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| from a principal's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| in their relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| with their law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| And they've called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| yes, we need them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| and this is how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| So it could be a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| and I will speak directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| for one of my schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| They said that the activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| and the relationship building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| that is embedded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| within their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| helps with the climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| within their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| when it works with operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| So those ideas could get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| and shared for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| throughout the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I know this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| I can report that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| and share those information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| but I'm sure there's other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| happening in different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| that we all can learn from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| So I don't think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I don't want us to get stuck on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| and I know this is what the item says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| fixing the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| but what are some best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| that we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| that could possibly model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| in different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| that are getting it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| That's what's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I needed a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| to think about the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| More important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| than what we're hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Yeah, we can't really hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Just lean in a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| and see if it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| When I lean too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I push on the mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I think what's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| is not just what we're hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| we all know what we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| but what are we not hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Lots of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| we have students, parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| principals, teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| who have information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| that they would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| for us to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| but they don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| share it with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| or they think we already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| So anything we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| to bring in information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| that we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I think that's just really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| that we find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| what don't we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| is much more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| than what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| last week I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| that I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| could hold public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| and I think somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| brought up a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| about people not trusting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| and we represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| We don't work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| we work for the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| who've elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| So I would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| that they would trust us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| to be able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| what they tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| and represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| And so that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| where I'm coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| is that in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| that we need to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| to represent the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| who've elected us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| and let them kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| direct us and guide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| on where we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| You know, what are the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Are those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| things that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| addressed through an MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| or are those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| things that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| addressed with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| and our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| who can then work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| or best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| may have come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| I said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| to identify what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| problems are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| what specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| what our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| and our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| and our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| You know, I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| heard a lot from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| community people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| who may or may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| be in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| and know what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| I really am more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| interested to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| what people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| are in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| and what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| or what the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| may be that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| as Ms. Owens said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| maybe haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| So, that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| I could have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| and maybe do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Google Doc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| in an anonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| for people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| add input if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| don't want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| But if I hold a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| meeting and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| don't come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I've had meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| where I've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| 50 to 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| who come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| if board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| who choose to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| if there's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| thing that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| and maybe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| the only time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| it's brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| then maybe that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| not really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| district-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| But if the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| issue is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| throughout several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| we would give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| our information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| to the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| they would kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| see what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| glean from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| commonalities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| that could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| inform what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| issues really are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| that are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| that we may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3482)|

| 0:58:07| I think the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| that may be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| way to go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| I'm not sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| going to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| MOA than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| fairly vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| since they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| pertinent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3504)|

| 0:58:26| And so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| I think to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| point Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3509)|

| 0:58:31| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| regarding an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| going to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| at a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3518)|

| 0:58:40| currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3520)|

| 0:58:42| kind of my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3522)|

| 0:58:46| that is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3526)|

| 0:58:58| So that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3541)|

| 0:59:04| represent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| people and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| we don't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| for KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| but most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| So that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| there's a trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3554)|

| 0:59:17| get past that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| trust breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| I would also say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| that if we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3561)|

| 0:59:23| information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| then just handing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3564)|

| 0:59:26| staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| expecting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3568)|

| 0:59:30| the facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| inherently changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3573)|

| 0:59:35| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| definitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=3578)|

| 1:11:18| share. You know I'm not sure how many of you have had the opportunity to be at an IEP meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| but as a parent they're stressful and it would be very difficult, impossible for me to truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| participate in an IEP meeting trying to advocate for my daughter as the only parent present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| while I'm sitting there frantically trying to take notes so I can take them home to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| with my husband and other members of our at home team. So I really feel for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| that keeping IEP meetings recorded is so important. You know I think to my daughter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| annual IEP meeting she had just last month and there's a goal she's working on both at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| home and in school and honestly she's struggling with it. And I had asked the teacher about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| it and the teacher went into great detail about kind of the mechanics of how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| implementing this goal at school. And then I was able to take it and take it back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| our home team so that we could kind of recreate that same scenario at home so we could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| with continuity and try and have that collaboration to help her reach the goal. There was no amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| of note taking I could have done that would have conveyed that same, that same level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| detail as listening to me as school teacher say specifically how they were able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| it. So for these reasons I just feel that a recorded IEP meeting is important. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| I see a recording as a positive thing. This is a tool that we can use and I hope it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| both ways. I hope that I say stuff at an IEP meeting that maybe the school staff can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| and take back and share. And I can't imagine a scenario where having the meeting recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4394)|
| 1:13:24| would be anything but positive for everyone on the team. So that's all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4404)|

| 1:14:28| meetings since our oldest was in preschool. We are one income family and I would tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| preschool teachers that dad couldn't take off work and wanted to hear the meetings. Another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| is that I don't always understand certain things that are said but instead of stopping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| meeting over every single term or having to take notes, I can stay engaged in the discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| listen again later to look up the terms on the internet. I then feel more prepared the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| meeting and also I can email the teacher if there was something that I had further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| about because of what I had learned on my own. I am a few years in this journey and already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| know a lot but new things surprise me each meeting because things can change from grade to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| grade. One thing I would like to correct that was said at last week's meeting is that the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| are actually usually not able to have things put in meeting notes that they want. I and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| parents I know have asked for specific things to be included and received a response that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| meeting notes are just summary of the meeting. So without a recording, parents don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| true record of what was or what was not said in IEP meeting. It has never been a problem that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| record meetings and I doubt any parent would have a problem giving two days notice. That way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| this could go from year to year and alert the school as teams have some new members each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| If you want to hear an example of an IEP meeting, I am happy to share. We have such an incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| IEP teams at Bonnie Kate for our two sons that honestly most of what you would hear is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210609?start=4554)|
