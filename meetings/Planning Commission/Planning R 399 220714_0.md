| 0:06:40| and honor one of our own up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| a fellow commissioner, former commissioner, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| The proclamation reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Knoxville-Knox County Planning has a long history of thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| considerate direction provided by its volunteer planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| which was continued by the service of Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| And whereas Scott Smith has served on the planning commission for the past eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| acting as vice chair for the past two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| during that time he has been committed to ensuring that all citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| have a voice in the planning process, are treated fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| and given reasonable consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| and whereas Scott's commitment to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| is apparent from the considerable time and efforts he has dedicated to volunteer positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| In addition to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Scott serves on the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| and is a longtime member of the Home Builders Association of Greater Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| And whereas Scott brings a unique perspective to the table from his experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| as a real estate broker and developer of both residential and commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| His knowledge of constraints of development has been immensely helpful to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| and fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| and whereas we are grateful for the perspective that Scott provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| as a veteran commissioner, offering a voice of reason during contentious cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| and always listening to all sides of the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| His approach will be missed by those who served alongside him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Now therefore be it resolved that the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| and planning staff express their gratitude for Scott Smith's contributions to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| and through good land use planning and dedicated public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| you will be sorely missed, fellow former commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| And if you would come up and get this proclamation please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| You are much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=530)|

| 0:19:31| It would be done in the next two years, five years, or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| But I hate to see any more commercial property go in down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| The state back in 19, if I can recall, 1991, or early 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1183)|
| 0:19:52| suggested or asked that there would be no more commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| from Ebenezer to Lines View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| Now, here we're faced with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Neighbors of mine don't want to see this either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| but they just hated to come up and oppose this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| because of the owners of the property now have been obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| I mean, a real pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| If you all don't know, I'd like to meet with some of you just independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| and talk to you, but I oppose this on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| The state is going to widen this road someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| Just like I said, the money has been already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I believe it would be a bad decision for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Through this whole process, we've been, myself as the architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| for representing the owner who is not able to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| we've been very open and honest with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| who have reached out to me to discuss this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| I've spoken with at least four persons who live in the direct area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| whether it's across the street, behind the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and been upfront about what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| The ultimate goal for this is to put in some sort of local neighborhood restaurant concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| which, of course, is not even for granted that it will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| That is a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| So I've always wanted to make sure that everyone understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| that what we're trying to do here is still contingent upon working with the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| on making sure that the development works for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| We're not trying to plant some golden arches here or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| We're trying to do a nice building and development in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| So we are very sensitive and willing to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| the concerns of gentlemen such as that he just spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| as well as some of the other people that we spoke with who are concerned about noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| light pollution, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| But, of course, the first thing that we have to go through with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| is find out if we can rezone it to make that possibility even possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| So that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| But we are certainly more than willing to work with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| to make sure this project does not become a burden on anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| The issues of traffic I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I live in a different area of town that has some similar issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| but for better or for worse, development and the commercial enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| that spur on business and job creation and things like that I think are a good thing overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| But we do notice or acknowledge that they must be balanced with the needs of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| and this would be a commercial neighborhood, neighborhood commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| which the neighborhood part of it definitely implies that being neighbors, good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| So that's really all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| We just wanted to reiterate we do have a commitment to make sure this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| if it goes forward in the form that we would like it to eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| we will definitely listen to feedback from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| As far as the widening of streets down the road, I'll be honest, I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| But certainly we've had some initial conversations with TDOT about this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| just gauging their reactions as to whether this would be a problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| And so far they have not let us know of any A, problems with it, or B, any plans to widen North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| Perhaps they didn't feel that they needed to tell me about that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| But in any case, that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| And we'll open it up to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I wanted to call you something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| You know, a lot of people want to call me a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I know the area well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| I visit that area quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I think given the recommendations by staff, both in their comments and recommendations on the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| and existing land use, I think it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and I will make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Commissioner Phillips made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Commissioner Higgins with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| I just wanted to make the comment that I think I agree with staff's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| for the same reasons that you expressed, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| The only regret I have is around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| There's one property that's sort of left outside of that neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| which is just a little awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| But I don't think anything can be done about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| I just wanted to express that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Seeing no other lights, we've got a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to NC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| neighborhood commercial, because it is consistent with the adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1552)|

| 0:25:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| The ayes carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| We have another action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Recommend, approve CN neighborhood commercial zoning because it is consistent with the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| development, per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| We have a second by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| Any other further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| If not, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Moving on to item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| File number 7C22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| The applicant is Candora Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| The location is north of Candora Avenue, west of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Approximate size of tract, 6.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Present zoning, IMU, industrial mixed use, and floodplain overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| Zoning requested, IH, heavy industrial, and floodplain overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| Existing land use is industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Staff recommendation, deny the rezoning to IH heavy industrial because it is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| with surrounding development since this area has been transitioning to light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| and other less intensive uses since the late 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Opposition, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1660)|

| 0:28:41| I also serve on the Mayor's Neighborhood Advisory Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| and as a Vestal representative with the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| The Vestal Community Organization has made substantial improvements to Goose Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| and the Mary Vestal Park and Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| The Vestal Community Organization agrees with the staff recommendation denying the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| We maintain that the zoning to a heavy commercial is heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| is not consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| We are a residential community with an identity connected with the history and character of Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1754)|
| 0:29:24| The Candoro Marble Building and surrounding areas define Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| We wish to see the area preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| The Vestal Community Organization has taken on a project to help us maintain our identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| We constructed an historical exhibit at the Mary Vestal Park Pavilion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| to recognize the Candoro Marble Building and the Vestal Lumber Manufacturing Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| along with history of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| In addition, we have serious environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| due to the property located on a flood plain with Goose Creek running through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| The Vestal Community Organization has invested in protecting Goose Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| along with creating Goose Creek to be enjoyed by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| We took on removing invasive vegetation along Goose Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and we created a riparian zone to allow for protection for public enjoyment of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| We also have concerns that the current property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| has not served the best interests of the Vestal Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| We do not believe that proper consideration will be given to the Vestal Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| should this zoning request be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| And finally, I'm sorry to have to report that Vestal residents have lost trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| in the necessary monitoring and protection of the environment in the Vestal Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| We continue to experience eye and throat irritation during the nighttime hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| when we hear and smell the production of what we believe is asphalt in the manufacturing stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you for allowing me to express the concerns of the Vestal Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| representing the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Do we have Joan Monica?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Is Ms. Monica here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Please remember we have looks like maybe three or four others and we're down to a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| I'd like to cede my time to the other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Let's go down to Ms. Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I'm the Chief Policy Officer for American Cannon here at 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you for the time today and for consideration of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| We, as the city of Knoxville, also agree with the planning staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| to deny the request to leave the zoning as is with industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| That lighter industrial mixed use zoning is more consistent with the trend we have seen in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| toward a lighter and less intensive commercial and industrial presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| and away from that historical heavy industrial use, which would now additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| adding to that would be out of character with the trend that we have seen this area shift toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| over the last few years, which includes, of course, accommodating neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| as well as lighter intensive commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Again, recognizing that historical industrial zoning would no longer fit the fabric of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| and it's not the direction this area needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| We saw that through extensive public and neighborhood interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and a desire to see that shift continue during our recode process several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| and the community input that was received during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| And that, of course, included a multiyear conversation that involved rezoning of multiple properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| across the cities that were notified and public process was made very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| during those multiyear conversations that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| So again, in summary, just really acknowledging staff's analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| that this would be a shift away from the trend that we have seen toward lighter, less intensive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| and would appreciate your support of their recommendation to deny the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| to hopefully maintain that trend in this important south Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Are there any others to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2014)|
| 0:33:45| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I'm Trudy Monaco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I live at 202 East Redbud Road in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| I'm the founder and former president and former executive director of the Candoro Arts and Heritage Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2035)|
| 0:34:04| that was housed in the Candoro building for almost 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| I feel like I have a pulse on the neighborhood there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| because the community worked so hard to preserve that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| During that 14 years, we stabilized the building and we renovated the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| Mr. David Witherspoon was very, very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| In fact, he sold the building for $75,000 less than he had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| Ms. Monaco, I'll give you about 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| I support retaining the current zoning because it best supports the creative reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| the community has worked towards that honors the history of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| and the cultural heritage of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| and because I'm concerned that across from it is the Superfund site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| which may also have impacted that site that you're talking about rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| Until some kind of testing is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| nothing more than is happening right now should be happening on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Monaco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| So I'll add 30 seconds to the applicant's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| so you'll have five minutes and 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Mr. Witherspoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you all for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| I'm not a very good public speaker, so please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| What we would like, as Kandor property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| is have the property rezoned back to what it was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| and always has been since Knoxville has done zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| and that is the I-4 or the I-H of the heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| We were never notified that the property was going to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| We never got mailings, no signs in the yard or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| I have talked to Ms. Liz about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| The only reason we found out is we had leased part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| and the tenant went in front of the city to get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| to store some aggregate material, and the city said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| you're not zoned for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And they came back to us and were like, yes, it's heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| And they're wanting to store some aggregate for some city projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| that are coming up, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| That's why we're here is we're just trying to get it zoned back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| to what the history has always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| As you can see on the map, you have that long stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| that is all heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| You have Rogers Group, their office, their asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| You have the concrete plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| You actually have five plots that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| Why did this one only get rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| I'm still trying to find that out, who initiated to get it rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and ask more questions that I'm not getting answers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| Also, it goes down to Alpha Industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| so it's about a mile of the heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| I've read the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I agree with some of it, and I disagree with a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| People talk about history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Back in the early 90s, no one was going to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| It was held by the banks forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| We finally decided to take a gamble, and we purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| As Ms. Trudy said, we did sell the office building to Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| to have it restored to its previous glory for history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Kandora Properties, we donated the sculpture that is there at Mary Vestal Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| We donated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| We donated the labor and the equipment to have it moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| We've donated to Dogwood Elementary to their outdoor learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| We took a truckload of granite and marble over there last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| We're in the process of doing some more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| We're trying to get some of the vegetation gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| We've also donated to Sequoia Elementary some of the Tennessee pink marble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| for a monument that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| We've also donated a lot of the marble to UT and the surrounding artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| We had probably a week that they came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| and we probably helped load probably 30, 40 pickup trucks, trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| you name it, of marble to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| Also, I've read the concerns of the trash and this and that and the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2369)|
| 0:39:38| Our company, we have donated our own time and labor of taking the homeless camps down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| that are by the creek that run through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| No telling how much tonnage of trash we've hauled out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| The grocery carts that align Candora Avenue from the homeless people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| we take them back to Kroger's and the grocery stores and Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| We've probably, over the last year, I'd say at least 50 grocery carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| And that's taking our time, our energy to do that to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| We also, about three times a year, we go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| and we take all the trash from the railroad track all the way to Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| I've been in discussions with Carson Daily of how to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| even also the Merry Festival that they have every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| We donate time and the land to park excess cars for the vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| So that's all I'm asking for is just, if we want to keep history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| put it back to the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Witherspoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Ms. Albertson, maybe you could add something to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| Sure, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| So we were reviewing this item, looking particularly at the trends in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| In your packets that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I believe we have some aerial photography from the 1950s on to the present day in the early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2473)|
| 0:41:22| Or, sorry, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And you can see that there is a bit of a shift that is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| at least based on vegetated land cover in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| You can see less cleared and graded areas for heavy industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| You see more vegetated land cover coming back into this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| And generally, this whole swath, I would say the east to west, not the north to south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| but the east to west, has really transitioned down to lesser intensive industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| And under the IMU zoning, there are also 25 uses that are permitted in that zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| that are not permitted in the IH zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| all of which have substantial opportunities for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| And that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Would you care to speak to what he said about it being rezoned without his consent or awareness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| Is that during recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| So my understanding, we checked in with the city clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| on all the returned letters that were received by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| They sent out a certified or a letter to all property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| and we couldn't find any evidence that there were any returned from this address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| or from the associated addresses with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| That was during recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Yes, during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| So the city had sent out letters to all property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| notifying them that this process was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| and to be sure to take a look at the map before it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| So the city council's office keeps record of all of those returned to sender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2599)|
| 0:43:29| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Again, comments similar to what Commissioner Higgins had to say about the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| So this property was actually downzoned during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| We don't have any evidence that the owner knew it was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| And they have the right to ask for it to be put back, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| In the equivalent zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Yeah, and I can speak to all the notification that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| If you'd like for me to give you a summary, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay, so between 2017 and 2019, there was a number of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| in terms of all of the information about this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| there were 13 press releases, two KUB billing inserts to all property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| so that happened in July 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| In July 2018, nine newsletters, 21 articles that included media coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| different community surveys, a number of public stakeholder meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| a number of city council workshops, stakeholder interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and, of course, over 50 community neighborhood meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| In addition to the letters that were sent out to all property owners by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and then our staff set up a dedicated line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| which had a number that was on that letter that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| And so that was staffed for anybody who had any questions, concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| and so they could call us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| All that was routed through Director Green, my predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| So quite a large effort to undertake to notify folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| So there was made, but we don't necessarily know that there was no acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| from the owner in this case, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Because I know of a case similar to that that happened around where my plant is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| They had no idea, and then one day somebody walked in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| You can't use this property for what you're using it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| One other comment, and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| You talk about a trend, but there's IH to the south, there's IH to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| or there's IH to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| And somebody made the comment Tuesday, and I'll make it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| There's not a whole lot of places in Knoxville that anybody's going to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| any heavy industrial use, and other places are not making any more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| And this has obviously been used for industrial use and was before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| so I'm kind of leaning towards thinking it's not that bad an idea to put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2767)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I also want to reflect on some of the comments and some of the packet presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| that Ms. Albertson made in agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| and also want to refer to the starting point of the early 90s, as the applicant did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| because 30 years has happened since the early 90s, and a lot has changed in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| When you were shown the packet information by Ms. Albertson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| she showed the permits that had been pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and the number of residential permits and business permits far exceeded the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| of industrial permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| There were merely a handful of industrial permits that had been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| So you really do see this transition having happened in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| And to top that off, and I spoke about this at review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| there have been significant investments made in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Kandoro, Marble, the arts that are now housed there, and Log Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| These are significant gems in Knoxville's landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| and for that reason I would like to make a motion to support staff's denial of this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| Okay, we have a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| First staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I'll second that, but I also have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| We've got a second from Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| We will now open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| And I see that we still have lights on, so I'm going to go to Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| I was trying to load the, I guess the recode website doesn't all work anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| there is a process where people commented specifically on properties with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| they were proposed to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| and I don't know what was commented on this neighborhood specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| but having been there personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| and been to the TriStar Arts Museum in the Kandoro building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| I just don't think that maintaining heavy industrial makes sense for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| specifically because it's along this road as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| even though the one to the north may still be heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| so I support denying the rezone request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I just wanted to add to Commissioner Roth's comments about the surrounding heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| One thing that I see looking at that is a lot of that is vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| and a big difference there is if you were to build a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| or use heavy industrial in a structure now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| you would build it to different standards than what this building was built to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| So using the structure that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| if someone were to come in and use that structure as is, as heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| there's a lot more opportunities for damage to life safety and environmental damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| So I definitely think that specifically looking at this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| IMU does make a lot more sense than the heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| even though there is other heavy industrial around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| A question for Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Liz, how is the sector plan shown on this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| I believe the sector plan for this area was completed in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| but there's also the one-year plan that shows this as heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| and I would argue that if these long-range plans were to be comprehensively updated for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| that that light industrial would actually extend across through that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| where all of the IMU zoning currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, new chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| I was the one that brought up the question about the industrial inventory that we have in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| and was curious as to what the city's position would be with that answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| and obviously the city is here today to say that they support or re-support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| what had been done through recode and reaffirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Obvious to all of us now that that community is making a lot of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| I really do hate on the flip side that we've got a piece that's bordered by heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3068)|
| 0:51:20| that's not going to be used, but it sounds like we've got enough vacant ground out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| that this company owns more property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| and they can continue to do some sort of heavy industrial operations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| Can I ask the city to come back up and just reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| that they think they've got plenty of heavy industrial zone properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| inside the city boundaries to accommodate any future needs and growth for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Planning staff could probably regurgitate off the top of their head the number of acreage that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| but I want to really specify that we see opportunities for industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| across different areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| and in particular one of the largest infrastructure investments that we have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| $5.5 million in the I-275 industrial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| is a very intentional effort to make sure that we are not ignoring the need for new industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| and industrial growth in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| but rather making sure that we are placing that additional industrial activity in places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| that can accommodate it both from an infrastructure perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| and in areas that are compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| and making sure that we're also leaving room for that type of light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| the industrial mixed use, for example, being places where you can see not heavy industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| but as Ms. Albertson pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| a quite diverse array of activities that can fall within those industrial mixed use areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| and again, pointing toward the I-275 investment as a place that we really hope to see additional growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Yes, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| So the notification from Recode was released around 2017, correct, or 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| No, it was a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| It started in 2017 and extended all the way through adoption in late 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| So there was several months, maybe a year, that he could have came and discussed this with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| Yes, I would say two solid years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion to deny the rezoning to IH per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| Motion made by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| And we have one in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| Moving on to Item 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3240)|
| 0:54:11| File number 7E22RZ and 7B22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| Applicant is Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Location, east of Tazewell Pike and west of Old Tazewell Pike near the intersection with Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| Tract information, two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Present plan designation and zoning, LDR, Low Density Residential, RA, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| Proposed plan designation and zoning, MDR, Medium Density Residential, and Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| Existing land use, Rural Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Density proposed, seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Staff recommendation, there are two motions to deny the sector plan amendment to MDR, Medium Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| because it is not compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Motion two, approve PR, Planned Residential, zoning up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| Is the applicant here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| I am, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| I'll let Mr. Murphy go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Mr. Murphy, you know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| In your invocation today, you expressed a desire to work for fair decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| and fairness and integrity is why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| I ask you to support the staff recommendation of Planned Residential up to three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| and I'd like to establish five points of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| First, this subject property is in the rural area of the Knox County growth plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Yes, the urban boundary is across Murphy Road from this, but it is, in fact, in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| Secondly, the growth plan, policy 3.5, has limits on density and low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| one to three units per acre in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| and the county mayor's office has stated that they view the policies in effect until advanced Knox wraps up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| and I believe there will be probably a new growth plan map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| and possible amendments to the growth plan proposed at the tail end of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| So we're in the process of looking at that and updating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Third, the Knoxville-Knox County general plan, development policy 11.2, which is in effect today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| deals with density for residential developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| It states that low-density, one to three dwelling units per acre in rural areas with infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| So that's what the general plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| So we've got the growth plan and then the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| The sector plan, fourth point, sector plan is the north city sector land plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| and that's actually silent on low-density residential in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| because it actually expects LDR to be over in planned growth or urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| The reason this is LDR is I was there in 2007 when it was updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| and they thought, well, we should just push, this is city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| we should just push the LDR all the way out to the edge of the city sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| which, strangely enough, means my farm is actually low-density residential on the sector plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| Finally, fifth fact, the county zoning ordinance 6.30.01.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| regarding text and map amendments to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| clearly states the proposed amendment shall be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| and not in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville-Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| including all of its major elements, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| So these facts clearly show that rezoning above three dwelling units an acre in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| is in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| and the elements of its sector plans as well as the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| So if you read the plans, follow the policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| and kind of connect the dots and follow A to B to C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| that says the conclusion is that the maximum should be three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| But the applicant's asking you to deviate from those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| and they're asking for an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Of course, you can ask for something, and in a lot of cases in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| there's not really a cost to asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| You can go up to the counter at the airport and you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| well, will you put me in first class today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| They'll probably say no, but hey, if they ask for it and you get it, that's a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| But in this case, if you grant this request, there's a cost to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| It costs all applicants and property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| because they don't know if they should follow what's set out in all of our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and our recommendations and our regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| or if they should be asking for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| It costs the integrity of the planning process with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| who's no longer confident that the policies and regulations will be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| It even costs the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| They have to work with more requests that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| and they're asking for things that are outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| And then I know our staff works really hard with the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| to try and get them as close to compliance and everything as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| And finally, it costs our elected bodies who get the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| And I do sit down with elected officials after you send the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| and they say, well, why did the Planning Commission recommend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| when the plan and the ordinance says this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| So we advocate for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| KCPA advocates for improving our land use processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| so that they're fair, simple, repeatable, and dependable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| And that's what we're asking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I hear the argument that it's a nice-looking proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| We want to do a little bit denser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| We want to maybe do some over 55 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| It's economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| But I don't see economic viability listed as a reason in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| to authorize an exception to a development policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| I do think that these are good arguments for us to change our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| KCPA was advocating to changes in the growth plan in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| when the growth plan amendment was being suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| And we are doing that now as part of Advanced NOCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| and we should be really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| And that's being done with robust public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| and input from experienced staff and consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| It's a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| So we ask you to update the plan, the Advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| That's the right way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Uphold the existing plans because the other thing that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| is if you approve an exception to our general plan and growth plan today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| well, once you have a new general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| are you going to then start approving exceptions immediately to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| That's the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| So we ask you to do something that's fair for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| I'm the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I'm here for the owner of 127 Properties, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Mr. Estes, he is one of the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| He is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| And I want to be clear, when I filed the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| we made a request for a sector plan amendment along with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| We are no longer seeking that sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and we are reducing our request from seven dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| to five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| which is consistent with the LDR sector plan that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Mr. Murphy educated me on one point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I did not realize that they, in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| decided to extend the LDR into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| And I find that very interesting to note because in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| that was the expiration date for the growth policy plan in the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| and the city's ordinance that adopted the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| They say, and I set forth this in my letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| that the growth policy plan shall be in effect until December 31 of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| In 2019, when they tried to amend and reinstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| and that was the language of the proposal, the ordinance at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| to reinstate the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| they recognized that it had been expired since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| Now, the general plan came along after the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| and adopted it by its terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| but it adopted it as it was adopted by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| which had an expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| And I understand the confusion behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| I understand the county law director's office has come out and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| it's no longer in force and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I know since it's advanced NOx, they have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| well, let's let this process play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| And I do understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| but they can't change the ordinance that adopted it had an expiration date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| and that is in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| And when they passed their amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and the only reason that's not where the growth policy plan is now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| because the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| which is completely on the other side of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| voted to deny the growth policy plan because they wanted to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| density around their municipal limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| But here, you know, this is right against the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| The growth policy plan was supposed to be reviewed every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Typically, there is a step down between urban growth, planned growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| and then rural area, but here there isn't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| And you would think one time in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| had they ever did their job and reviewed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| that this area would have been included in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| which, as Mr. Murphy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| that's typically what the LDR sector plan has intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| When the county commission looked at this in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| their amendment to the growth policy plan was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| let's just let the sector plans control what the density is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| which is what we're asking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| This is a small two-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Staff mentioned that we had this conversation last year about the Jenkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| property there, which is right there to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| which was ultimately approved at three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| This body recommended four dwelling units an acre for that piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| property based upon these same arguments for the growth policy plan I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| making today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| And it was the district commissioner, Richie Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| who said he thinks that's too far away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| and that area across old Tazewell Pike was still in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Mr. Beeler is not of that opinion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Mr. Estes and I have talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| and he's in support of this area being right beside Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| which is in the city, being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| included a density up to five dwelling units an acre to encourage this 55-plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| townhome development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| We asked initially for seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| We really hadn't penned a paper on what that could be laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Once we looked at it, there's a single-family residence there that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| going to keep, and we're looking at putting nine units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| So that would be ten total, nine new single-story townhomes to cater to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| fastest-growing age demographic in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| So I wish we could speed up time and we could get to the point where we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| have to be talking about some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| We had the advance knocks in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| We had updates, but it does take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| But in the meantime, we have an application here that is consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| the sector plan, is consistent with the policies that were adopted in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| and the expiration dates that were adopted in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| and makes sense for the needs of the community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| I know Old Tazewell Pike is being considered to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| and they're actually looking at maybe terminating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| It won't affect our access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| TDOT's studying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| So this area is changing, and we think that it is appropriate at this time to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| you can deny the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| but to pass the planned residential zoning at five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Staff agrees this planned residential zoning is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| We're just talking about a difference of four dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I see Commissioner Adams, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I agree that this area is changing quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| I'm out there very frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| and there are houses popping up everywhere you can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| The reference to the fastest-growing demographic for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| and the attractive idea of 55-plus housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| I just want to remind everyone that's really not what we're supposed to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| It's just a flat-out rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| And do we feel like three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| which appears to be what is contiguous to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| is that appropriate or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I am in agreement with staff's recommendation on that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| and support the three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| Oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Vice Chair Aden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Chairman, do we need to go ahead and just deal with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| and make a motion that we deny the sector plan amendment from LDR to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| per staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| I want to talk about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| We can go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| So we've got a motion to deny the sector plan for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| And then, Chairman, while I still have my light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| is it okay to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| On my package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| it does not bring in the attached planned residential product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| a little further south from this particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Can somebody scroll down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Yeah, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| And does anybody have any idea how long that's been out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| Understanding this is a different piece and there's boundary lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| but we all, I think, know that a lot's happened since that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It looks like that property was platted in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| You know, about every month we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| we hear recommendations that we need to increase our availability of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| and we talk about density and we talk about the need for more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| Properties, way more expensive than it was 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| It might have made sense to have three dwelling units breakers 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| but today it probably doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I know we're not supposed to make decisions based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| but that's something that comes into everyone's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| when we're looking at development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| We know there's no inventory of houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| and I wouldn't be opposed to five dwelling units an acre on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| We approve planned residential five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| We have a motion to approve PR up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Yeah, I was just going to say in the comment where the applicant submitted the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| that had a potential site plan, that kind of helped me get comfortable with five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| seeing how it could be laid out and not so crammed as I might have thought it was otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| If anyone wants to look at that, it's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| We've got three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Okay, let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4233)|

| 1:13:41| Nevertheless, good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| I'm Elliot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| As mentioned, long-time planning and development admirer, first-time participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| So, thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| A little bit about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| I'm a newlywed small business owner in the West Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| I care deeply about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| My goal in being here is to make an impactful improvement to a very difficult property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| I've submitted for a general commercial sector plan designation with the zoning of CB to my property at Zero Level Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| This property is presently a designated sinkhole by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| My development of the property would make use of an otherwise barely usable 1.82 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| located off of what soon will be a more heavily trafficked arterial road, level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4464)|
| 1:14:33| The development will provide more vibrant economic opportunity for businesses in the greater Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| and more effectively make use of land for the community and business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| The land being located on a road that is one of the primary routes to the soon-to-open family entertainment center, Topgolf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| located one mile away and also directly across from the U.S. cellular soccer fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| The current plan potentially includes cutting down trees, excavation, landscaping, building a billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| building a professional-use structure, and building a retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| for which I commissioned a geotechnical material sciences engineering firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| to collect six 20-foot deep boring samples of land and perform analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| Their findings include soil analysis and firm approval of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| within Knox County's 50-foot buffer zone to any designated sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| While next steps do include submitting the work for approval to build within that buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| ultimately, when approved, the development will create much more suitable land to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| and more opportunities therefrom for our business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| If I'm not mistaken, we received a letter, like, right before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| that was saying something about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Can Ms. Albertson or legal counsel speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Ms. Bleckney, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| So, I'm happy to speak to that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I don't know if you all, members of the commission, received that because it was received by us just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| It's a letter from counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| As I understand it, and the applicant may have more information than I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| because we've only just been made aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| so we wanted to make you aware in abundance of caution that we received that correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| As I understand it, it appears to be a dispute or perhaps the beginnings of a dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| concerning actual ownership or the appropriateness of the transfer of the ownership of that property that is issued here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| There has been nothing, at least as I understand it, for the purposes of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| It would probably be helpful for the applicant to clarify that what I've seen is only a piece of correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| and that there is no litigation that's currently pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Would you mind to answer that question for us for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| It's the children are upset that the father sold the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| Ultimately, the owner of the title insurance company was there at location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| and deemed the individual entirely competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Sir, I'm sure you're probably represented by counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| and I'm not going to ask you to talk in detail about something that is in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| My question is a really simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Is there litigation pending, or is it just that there was a demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| letting you know that there's a dispute about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| No litigation whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Then in that case, I'm not aware of anything that's pending that would prohibit the commission today from acting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| Staff has done their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| They've verified what needed to be verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| The applicant has met the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| There's no injunction or other court action that has prohibited the action by the commission that we have been advised of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| So this is essentially a land use decision at this point and apparently a dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| that I won't ask the applicant to address any further in detail for your benefit, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| But I don't think that it needs to stop the process today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| We shared it just to make you aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Any other questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Tasha, if there were something that we didn't know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| and they didn't know about that was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| obviously the court would make a ruling either in favor or against what our ruling is today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| And it may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| The short answer to that, Commissioner Roth, is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| It's a more fundamental question at issue right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| is whether there was an appropriate transfer of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| So that would really get to the bottom line of going back to look at the details of that transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| whether it was appropriately done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Did that help answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Chairman Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I'd like to make a motion to approve the Sector Plan Amendment to GC General Commercial per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4745)|

| 1:19:14| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| If not, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4759)|

| 1:19:25| Chairman Hill, I'd like to make a motion to approve CB Business and Manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| because it is consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4773)|

| 1:19:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4782)|

| 1:21:05| Thank you, and I appreciate being deferred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Doug Campbell, EVP, General Counsel, Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| 244 Fort Sanders West Boulevard, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| We are here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| On behalf of Covenant Health and affiliates who are property owners in Dowell Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| that would include Dowell Springs Behavioral Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| which is a project currently under construction in the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| for a much needed inpatient behavioral health hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| here with the support of our partner, Acadia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Peninsula Medical, Park West Medical Center, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| and Peninsula Behavioral Health, who own an outpatient center in Dowell Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| and the Thompson Cancer Survival Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| who is acquiring the proton therapy center as of Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| So Covenant Health's presence in Dowell Springs is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Also folks here from Knoxville Orthopedic Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| gastrointestinal associates, but all owners of property in Dowell Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| To be clear, Dowell Springs is a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| Dowell Springs was sold as a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Dowell Springs was marketed for probably 20 years as a medical park by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| That developer is here today as a property owner in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| seeking to expand into a medical park, sold and marketed as a medical park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| and as office park, the technical designation for zoning, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| and office under the one-year plan sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| He's now decided it would be good to be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| That property shown at the very tip, northern tip, northwestern tip of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| about 22 acres, the developer owns a piece of property up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| About 10 acres of that is zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| That's the only residential property in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| And to be clear, it is a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| And the uses in there are very consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| The uses in there are very compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| No part of the park has a sector plan or zoning designation that is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| So our view is that, and I often deal with this on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| where a company that I might be representing or involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| is trying to do something needed in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Perhaps it's health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| And the residents say, no, we don't want that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| It's not compatible with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| We hear a lot of that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I've dealt with that, and I've had counsel to represent us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| But, again, the important thing to understand is that for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| this has been a neighborhood and it is a neighborhood that has very specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| They're very consistent, one with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Expanding residential into this neighborhood is not compatible with what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| We don't think it's compatible with existing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| We don't think it's appropriate, given the additional traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| that 22 acres of medium-density residential development could bring along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| So we would ask that the applicant be denied the requested amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Mr. Boddy, just before you start, I want to – oh, I'm sorry, we have another opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Jennifer Pearson Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| I'm Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel of Ortho Tennessee PC-256,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Fort Sanders West Boulevard, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| We're here in opposition today on behalf of Ortho Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| which is the largest orthopedic physician practice in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| We do business in the Dow Springs Business Park as Knoxville Orthopedic Clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| and have been there since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| The building was completed in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| The Dow Springs location is the largest of the KOC office clinic locations in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| It was marketed throughout the early 2000s as a medical office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| We purchased and moved into that location, transferring our clinic location from another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| into Dow Springs to be part of a medical business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Currently, the most concerning of ours, our property is just down the hill from the proposed subject parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| and there are only two access ways in and out of the subject parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| and they have to go through the medical and business development to get up to the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| There's no other access back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| which would create an undue burden of the traffic flow on some fairly –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| they're small roads that are intended for medical business office use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| adding 22 acres of residential development would overly burden those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| where our patients are trying to come in and out of the medical office complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| That would increase potential for traffic accidents, need additional road signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| stop signs in order to help develop that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| So, therefore, we are asking respectfully that this application be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| so that this property can maintain its current and consistent use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Commissioners, I failed to read the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| and so I'll go ahead and read that before Mr. Bodie comes before the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| The motion is to approve the sector plan to MDRO, Medium Density Residential Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| and hillside protection because it provides a transitional land use between the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| and industrial uses in the adjacent residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| Do we have any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Chairman Hill, we also have a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5193)|
| 1:26:49| The one-year plan amendment is to approve the one-year plan amendment to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| Medium Density Residential Office, and HP hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| because it provides a transitional land use between the office and industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| in the adjacent residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Mr. Forrester, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| here on behalf of Covenant Health in opposition to these requested amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| As noted in the staff report, and as everyone knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| there are certain requirements that must be first established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| before the sector plan or one-year plan can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| We submit that they must show that there is material change in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| If you've been to this park, it's, I think, been developed ongoing for the past 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| and has been developed continuously as an office park, primarily a medical office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| Furthermore, there have been no new roads or utilities that have been constructed in this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| This is the same infrastructure that's been there for the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| As noted in the staff report, staff admits that there is no obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| or significant error or omission to the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| Again, another factor or condition that is not established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| for amending the sector plan or the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Furthermore, the lack of trends, the trends in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| we submit that the trend has been consistent throughout this office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| with office development, with primarily being medical office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| With that being said, we request that you deny the applicants' application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| and requested sector plan and one-year plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Mr. Bode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| One thing I want to say, we're not going to add 22 acres of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| We want to add 12 acres of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| The 10 acres, it's zoned there, and that was zoned when every property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| in Dowell Springs bought their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| We did a declaration in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| There's a living document that provided for some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| As I mentioned, every buyer knew there was already 10 acres of residential in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| We thought this parcel would be the very last parcel to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| We have two others that haven't been developed yet, but that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| We're just requesting that the rest of this one parcel conform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| to the zoning that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| There were some public comments about a slide at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| I want to be very clear that I was very transparent with all the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| in the park about what we were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| I met with Ms. Albertson to get her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I met with Councilwoman Singh, who is the councilwoman for this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| After that, I started contacting every single owner in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| I talked with several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| They told me they wanted to meet with their doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| I said, sure, that's why I'm letting you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I was very clear about what we were going to be asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| The ones who were in opposition said that, of course, the big reason was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| the doctors did not want all that additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| They'd had some problems in other areas with traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| and they just were not interested in adding more traffic to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| There's two signalized intersections serving the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| It would be logical that any traffic generated by the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| is going to be leaving the park in the morning when the doctors are arriving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| and, of course, just the opposite in the afternoon when they're leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| so when the residential would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| Regardless of whatever gets developed back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| the City of Knoxville will have to approve any development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| including traffic impact, stormwater, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| existing easements, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| In closing, I respectfully ask that you approve these applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| and follow your staff's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| and what a majority of the owners in Dow Springs Park have agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| I'm going to start with a motion to approve following staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| and I also think that this is actually a really great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| This development has sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| and I think a mix of use would be really great here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| so with that I've made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| And I'd also like to add that there's also a bus route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| that runs through this development as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| and gives access to a lot of people to get in and out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| and maybe not have as much bad traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| We have a motion on the sector plan by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| We have a second by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| I see other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I concur with what the applicant said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| that the traffic patterns ostensibly would be working in a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| that wouldn't congest things for patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| Dwellers would be leaving as patients were arriving and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| I have a clarification question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| because where is the residential that this is providing a buffer for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| And I just need someone to point it out on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Ms. Albertson, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| It's fairly sparse residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| It is fairly sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Fairly sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| If you would turn on the aerial, I think you might see a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| just some of the residential properties that are back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| There are some large lot agricultural zoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| but they all have single family residential on them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| The only other question I have, because I, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| I felt like I was reading this case and seeing the ups and downs of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| is the commitment that was or wasn't made for this to always be a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5567)|
| 1:32:58| park and only a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| That's the only thing that kind of bugs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| If there was some commitment made at some point that it would only ever be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| a medical park, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| There was never a commitment that it would be totally a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| As I said, the 10 acres on the rear residential was already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| and zoned when the property was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| Was it rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Was half of that property rezoned before to become the medical park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| When RECODE came through, the residential was already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| and then RECODE assigned RN-5 to it, which we're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| Well, I'm talking about the part that's actually not residential right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| Was it residential before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| No, that was under the old zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| I think it was OP-3 or OP-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| It was office park was the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| There was also retail zoning in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| It was PC-1 back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Some of you all may remember PC-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| We had retail zoning, in fact, right behind where the GIA is on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| and then, of course, that ended up becoming the proton center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Yeah, what I was getting at was I'm assuming and I don't know all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| No, it wasn't just medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| We had retail planned for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| It never materialized, and so it started shifting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| And like I said, that's why the document was a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| We didn't know how this was going to turn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Mr. Campbell, I'll give you an opportunity to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| I'd only point out, I mean, at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| and this is not something I know this body gets into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| and probably doesn't want to hear a lot about private restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| but until about a week ago, there was a clear private restriction put down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| by this developer that said there'd be no residential development in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| That was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| We'll be talking to Mr. Bodie in another forum about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| the process by which it was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| but there was essentially a commitment made through the private restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| that this was an office park, this was a medical park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| Everyone you've heard from today bought property on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| I'd like to hear from Mr. Bodie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Campbell's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| That amendment was just recorded last week, but we followed the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| We started in May notifying property owners of what we intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| These are all laid out in the declaration of how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| So, again, no sleight of hand was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| We followed the procedures in the guidelines, and it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| All right, commissioners, we have, let's see, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5730)|

| 1:35:45| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5745)|

| 1:38:26| We got the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| My realtor got a call that they wanted to back out of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| Today was the first I knew of the opposition to rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| We will proceed on doing a subdivision next to this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| without the 1.31 acres if that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| It's just that the value of this piece of land will be greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5929)|

| 1:39:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=5982)|

| 1:40:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| I just wish to withdraw only because the contract fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| So I don't really have a need in proceeding with that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| Are you the owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6019)|

| 1:40:40| Maybe I should have paid better attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| So we have the owner of the property on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| The contract has not had anything sent from the property owner saying that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| anything official sent from the property owner saying that they didn't want to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6052)|

| 1:41:08| I may need to refer to staff a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Based on this, I am concerned about the applicant's authorization to proceed with this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6071)|

| 1:41:23| It may be that this one is no longer appropriate for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Well, what I would say is if we have the owner on Zoom who is saying that they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| to move forward, I would recommend postponement, and then it can be withdrawn at a later meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| At another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| I'd make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6108)|

| 1:51:46| And I wanted to thank the developer, Ron Worldly, for accepting the staff recommendation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| up to three units per acre, which is consistent with the recent rezoning property on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| side of our property next to the Jacksons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| My immediate family and I have occupied the property adjacent to this development for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| And because of my dad's serious health issues, my parents have moved in for us to care for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| And for the record, my family and I are not in agreement with up to three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| but we cannot purchase the property ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| And we understand that we cannot stand in the way of the property being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| The side of our home of over 30 years is located very close to the common property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6750)|

| 1:52:40| And we just have two requests to be attached to the rezoning approval today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| And they are, one, that the peripheral building setback would be a minimum of 50 feet adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6766)|
| 1:52:54| to our common property line, and that we also request a minimum eight-foot-tall green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| giant arborvitae be placed along our common property line within 150 feet of our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6781)|

| 1:53:13| So I'm just asking Mr. Worldly if he would agree to our two conditions for rezoning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| Thank you. Mr. Worldly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| Could you please state your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6813)|

| 1:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Well, I was on the consent agenda, I think, until just a while ago, so having not had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6824)|
| 1:53:54| much time to process opposition, I guess at this point I've got two things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6834)|
| 1:54:03| One is I would be more than happy to sit down and talk to you, but not being privy to exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6843)|
| 1:54:10| what this entails, I think I can see their house and I think I know which property it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| is, and it does appear that it's close to the property line, maybe even on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| line. I'm not sure the exacts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| So the first thing I'd like to say is, yes, I'd be more than happy to sit down and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| with you. I can't promise you that I could agree or disagree with your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| My second question is, is this the proper forum to address these items, or is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| thing to address is, can we get the property rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6881)|

| 1:54:49| I would say that you all should focus on the rezoning. If approved for planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6889)|

| 1:55:11| be more than happy to meet with the neighbors and to see if I could accommodate. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6911)|

| 1:55:26| know, the higher density and the more homes that you can put on a piece of property, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| you can reduce the cost of the home. We all know that we have an affordability crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| going on in the world today, and so my desire would have been to have gotten five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=6936)|

| 2:10:42| rezoning, we had a concept plan very, very similar to this already proposed. We worked hard with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=7842)|
| 2:10:49| staff on working through some of the complexities. It's a gorgeous piece of property. There's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=7849)|

| 2:14:44| Would you like to defer to Mr. Murphy? No, I'll go first on this. I think we have an agreement worked out with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| opposition on it. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street. Mr. Murphy was concerned about connectivity and the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| there was a lack of a stub out street to the adjoining property on the south, which we don't have ownership or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| control of. We weren't in agreement with a stub out. I know that's something that's discretionary. Staff can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| recommend that. It's may, not shall. It's not required to comply with the subdivision regulations, and staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| recommending approval of this. But what we worked with Mr. Murphy, instead of having vehicular access, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| some trails on the property in the common area there to the southwest. We're going to extend those out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8124)|
| 2:15:33| adjoining property along the back of those lots there in the south to allow there to be future pedestrian greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8133)|
| 2:15:40| connectivity. It's something that the adjoining property owner could connect to if they want to, and I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8140)|
| 2:15:48| that should address the opposition's concerns on that. I'll let Mr. Murphy speak for that as well. If there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| questions, we're here to answer them. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Murphy. Thank you, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8154)|
| 2:16:05| I do appreciate the applicant providing the pedestrian access. I want to call out, this is something that's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| little bit more than two years ago. Those of you that were on Planning Commission, on that Zoom meeting in May of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| 2020, the parcel to the north had a development plan and concept plan approved, and I spoke and I asked for a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| or something there, and the commission did not put that in place, and now you've got the parcel immediately adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| the south that could be using that stub out, but that's not there. And in those comments, and this was in the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8191)|
| 2:16:40| that I posted, I put a map that shows some of the subdivisions in that general area, and if you look at that, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| see that across the street on Beeler Road, you've got a subdivision, and then you've got some more development that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| over towards the west. I took two houses that had their backyards next to each other, I think on like Springer Drive and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8212)|
| 2:17:00| Brock Boulevard, so a little bit, if you move the mouse down and just a little bit to the left. But yeah, you have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8220)|
| 2:17:06| those neighborhoods there are not connected at all. And I said, well, if I've got, you know, a kid in one house and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8226)|
| 2:17:12| across the street in the backyard, how long is the walking distance? Well, it's 2.5 miles, 49 minutes, and that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8232)|
| 2:17:20| that's what our design patterns are doing when we don't do neighborhood connectivity. So in this area, we're continuing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8240)|
| 2:17:28| you know, we've got a subdivision, a large one, a couple to the north of this parcel, we've got another one, and one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| friends was like, no more thermometer subdivisions, and, you know, but we're building thermometers with the cul-de-sac bulbs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| So I'm excited, you know, that the applicant's going to, you know, provide, you know, a walking trail, you know, along the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| That helps with pedestrian, which is one of the biggest things. You know, if you're in a car, maybe it's a little easier to get around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| but if you're a pedestrian and there's not connectivity, you can't do it. So I appreciate the applicant making this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| That's a start, but I just want to use it as an example of we really do need connectivity and there's a benefit, and right in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| again, you know, this is astounding to me, 2.5 miles, 49 minutes. If I can dig it up, I'll send you, but I think a lot of you have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8286)|
| 2:18:15| there's a Strongtown's post and an article that shows subdivisions in Orlando that are back-to-back, and by car, it is more than 13 miles to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8295)|
| 2:18:25| from one house to the other, you know, because there is no connectivity. So we have opportunities to improve our game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| and perhaps we should look at some updates to the subdivision regulations to strengthen or maybe make that a shall requirement instead of an optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8311)|
| 2:18:40| hey, it's kind of nice. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8320)|

| 2:18:45| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the requested variances based on justification provided by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| recommendations of Knox County Junior Public Works, and the proposal will not create a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth. I see we have some lights on. Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| Yes, I wanted to say thank you for working on that and getting the pedestrian access, because I concur, I feel like that's a very important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8347)|
| 2:19:17| and anything that can help minimize the number of car trips that have to be taken and increase the ability of walkability is a positive thing for our community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8357)|
| 2:19:27| and for the communities of those specific neighborhoods. I did want to ask just one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8367)|
| 2:19:33| The applicant is saying that they would not be willing to put a stub out as was recommended in addition to that pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8373)|
| 2:19:43| The stub out wasn't recommended by planning staff. That was something that Mr. Murphy asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| No, no, I meant that was recommended by the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| No, no, and we've often run into when there is a stub out on an existing neighborhood to a vacant piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8389)|
| 2:19:59| there was a big controversy on some property in Carnes that Smithville had developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| There was an existing stub out in a development that had a boulevard access entrance that had a stub out on Patriot Way to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8405)|
| 2:20:12| The neighborhood was completely opposed to allowing the new development to have access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| and that was their main opposition was we don't want this traffic to come through our existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| One of the reasons to deny a use on review for the PR zone is it unnecessarily draws traffic through an existing neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8423)|
| 2:20:32| so the developers don't necessarily like it unless they control the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| and the existing neighborhoods typically don't like it either because it's introducing an unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| So that was our concerns about that, and I think that's why it's discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| You need to look at it on a case-by-case basis and see if it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| So the applicant is not willing to put a vehicular stub out, but we are willing to increase the pedestrian connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| And if I could add to it, David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| The grades in that area right there, it's pretty steep, and in order to get a road that would work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| I'd probably have to start going down pretty quickly to make that work because it's falling off about 10 percent there on our property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| So from a grade perspective, it would be really quite difficult to put in a stub road at that point that would work with the adjacent property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8476)|
| 2:21:25| I appreciate the answers from both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| And then just to the body, I would like to say that I feel like those answers reflect where the development is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8488)|
| 2:21:39| The concept plan is there, and it's a conversation that needs to happen earlier in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8499)|
| 2:21:47| and I think behooves all the planners and developers to really think about that connectivity and making a difference as they're working that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8507)|
| 2:21:56| So it's not that grade just doesn't work or we don't want that for such and such reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| but thinking about the community at large and what good that can do further down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8521)|
| 2:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| What I was going to do is make a motion to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| I was going to add an additional condition, make it ten conditions instead of nine, to do pedestrian access to the property to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8535)|
| 2:22:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| Have we voted on the first one yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| Yeah, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| You just amended your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| No, we dealt with variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| We didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| I don't think we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| Right, but I just wanted to be clear that I was going to add that pedestrian access next, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8562)|
| 2:22:50| Mumbling over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| So where on this site plan was that discussed that pedestrian access would go to the south property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8575)|
| 2:23:09| It's on the southwest side right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| If you can zoom in, my eyes aren't good enough now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| I can't see the lot numbers in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| Yeah, we'll change the rear lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| I think that's lot 70 and 71 right there to add additional common area in that area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8600)|
| 2:23:27| We have a walking trail shown around the pond, so we'll just include a stub going to the adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| I think it's the major's property over there up in that area where the arrow is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| Is this around lot 70, 71?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| I think we need to be specific with that in the condition because you can provide access on a completely different part than it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| No good on the intent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8634)|
| 2:24:03| Vice Chair, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| Let's vote on the variances and then I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8648)|
| 2:24:26| We have a motion and a second, and I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| The ayes carry 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| What concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| I'll make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| adding a pedestrian access from the property off of the current proposed walking trail system to the south around lots 70 and 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8685)|
| 2:25:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| Is that a sufficient description for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| Seeing no lights, no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| The ayes carry 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan for a residential subdivision with up to 83 attached dwellings and three detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8731)|
| 2:25:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| On motion three, we've got Vice Chair Uten making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| We've got Commissioner Roth seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| Seeing no lights, no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| The ayes carry 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| Item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| Require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| File 7SB22C, 7B22UR, subdivision Leonard Development, Jenkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8777)|
| 2:26:25| Applicant developer David Harbin, Batson Hines, Norvell & Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| Location, south side of Jenkins Road, east of Springwood Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| Approximate acreage, 6.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Zoning, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| Existing land use, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Number of lots, 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| Subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Looks like we have two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| We have an alternative design standards requiring Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| We have one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| And then we have one item under the alternative design standards requiring Knox County Engineering and Public Works approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8823)|
| 2:27:12| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| Approve the requested variances and alternative design standard based on the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8834)|
| 2:27:24| And the proposal will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| Motion two would be approve the concept plans subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| And then motion three would be approve the development plan for a detached residential subdivision with up to 22 lots and reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8852)|
| 2:27:49| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8869)|

| 2:27:52| Please state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8872)|
| 2:27:53| Frank Leonard, 119 Westville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| Mr. Leonard, would you like for the opposition to go first or would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| They can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| My name is Paul Lauterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| I'm here with 1517 Meeting House Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| I sent in some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| I hope you received those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| There were major mistakes made in this instance resulting in trespass on our property, West Knoxville Friends Meeting property, and essentially desecration of our burial grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8905)|
| 2:28:44| I don't need to do finger pointing, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| I don't know if it would do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| Who did this, what not, how it was done, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| We don't want that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Can this body act to stop that and ensure that it doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8937)|
| 2:29:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| So we would oppose this development unless the developer can meet the conditions of putting up a substantial barrier on our mutual property line, a fence, to ensure that no one, contractors, whoever else it might be, come onto our property, damage our property now or in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8950)|
| 2:29:39| put up a fence, maintain that fence, and probably put covenants on all the properties that would adjoin ours ensuring that the property owners maintain that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8979)|
| 2:29:59| If the developer can agree to those conditions, I guess we don't really oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=8999)|
| 2:30:06| Otherwise, we oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| Mr. Leonard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| I want to thank you all for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| I certainly respect and appreciate their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| I do want to say the only work that we've done so far was in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| There was some bush hogging done on this property for survey purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| On June 26th, I received an email from Alex Curley, who represented as a member of the West Knoxville family meeting organization, and we met together on June 27th on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9031)|
| 2:30:45| He was concerned for the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| We walked it together, and he showed me where the cemetery was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| He told me at that point it appeared that we had not done any damage from the bush hogging and asked that I would contact him if we did any further development work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9052)|
| 2:31:00| I assured him that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| He gave me his contact information, and we had communicated and followed up over email as well to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| As far as I know, he is the only person who's reached out to me as part of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| We walked the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| He said we were not on the cemetery, but by all means, we want to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9074)|
| 2:31:20| We see in the staff recommendation that there is a construction fencing that is required and certainly agree to that and all other terms of the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9080)|
| 2:31:29| We'll look at what options we can do during our final design plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| Thank you, Mr. Leonard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9096)|

| 2:40:54| I think we addressed many of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| and I think that given, and when we look at the comments on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| pretty much ever since we went to 77 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| I don't see barely one or two negative comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| and I think the fact that I'm just very pleased and encouraged that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9671)|
| 2:41:19| process of collaboration can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| So often in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| we're at loggerheads between the developer and the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| and so I just want to take my hat off to the neighborhood, to Tommy Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| to Gail Atherton, and to Dave Cockrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| Everybody really put their all into getting to where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| and that's thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Yes, thank you for the comment that just came from the Zoom fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9710)|
| 2:41:59| Mr. Case, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| I wanted to share as well that the tenor in terms of the comments that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9721)|
| 2:42:08| received from the neighborhood, ostensibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| because we've had the item on the agenda and it keeps being postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| so we had a lot of time to get comments from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| and the tenor completely changed this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| The number of persons who were saying that they were in favor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| project and really appreciated the collaboration and the adjustments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| the dialogue was really high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| So I, too, express positive words for the way the process is being handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| and especially since this is we don't have plan development very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| I hope we have more of them, but this seems very positive for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| I had one question, and that is about the walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| That was an item that was on an earlier iteration of the plan and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9770)|
| 2:42:54| is not there, and I brought this up at the agenda review and was encouraged to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| ask you about it, if it might be coming back or the potential for it to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| back still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| This is David Cockrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| Through the course of our half dozen neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| there was not consensus among the neighbors supporting that walking trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9794)|
| 2:43:21| that would connect through our property to the Mary Evers Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| So we tabled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| We, that is David Case and I, are still amenable to working with both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| Neighborhood Association and the city to make that a reality if that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| will of the majority and to the benefit of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| So that is something we're still open to in regards to the use of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| property and participation with our finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| A final plan has to come back here to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to approve the plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| I'd like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| For staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Did you get that, Miss Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9870)|

| 2:44:32| Ayes carry 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9876)|

| 2:44:44| The vice chair and I would like to announce the executive committee for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220714?start=9884)|
