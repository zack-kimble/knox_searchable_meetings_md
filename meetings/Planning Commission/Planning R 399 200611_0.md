| 0:08:02| and Withdrawal Lists. I will read these lists separately. If you'll hold just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=482)|
| 0:08:21| Okay. There are no automatic postponements. Items to be voted on to be postponed until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=501)|
| 0:08:37| there are no items voted to be voted on to be postponed. There are no 30-day postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=517)|
| 0:08:46| There are no postponements at all. Excuse me. I think we do have one. Didn't we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| a letter on Woodbury Crossing? Yes. Thank you, Commissioner Phillips, Vice-Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=533)|
| 0:09:02| That item was received too late to be included in the vote. However, I was getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| to ask for if there was anyone that had anything they'd like to add, and I see that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| first, Garrett. We've got several hands raised. Let's go with Garrett Tucker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| Yes, this is Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane. We would like to request a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| of item 24. We had sent in a request for postponement, but that was a little bit late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| So we want to postpone it 60 days to the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Okay. Postpone for 60 days, item number 24. Ben Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Yes, Commissioner. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street. I would like to request a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=595)|
| 0:10:07| for item number 11. We have already informed Commissioner Green and Ms. Fortier that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| were intending to postpone this to give us an opportunity to speak to the neighbors about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| some of their concerns and see if there is another avenue we can address those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| while still trying to offset some of the operating expenses of this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=628)|

| 0:20:31| but I did post a sign on the front. Okay, that was my only concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| regarding that agenda item. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1235)|

| 0:22:57| At this meeting, first, we're going to go with the hellos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| We'd like to welcome Sandra Korbelik to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1382)|

| 0:23:16| It's a nice blend of planning and anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| She's a member of the Urban Design and Preservation Division of the American Planning Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| She told us at our agenda review meeting that her passion are plants, planning, and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| It's going to make an interesting perspective on many of the agenda items that come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1415)|

| 0:23:42| questions and providing valuable insight into the items that the commission will be reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1422)|

| 0:23:54| Tom Breschko, who's part of the planning staff, will be retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1434)|

| 0:24:05| of knowledge about all aspects of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| For most of the time I've been on commission, much of his input has been on subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| regulations and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1453)|

| 0:24:20| cases, and his reports are always impeccable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1460)|

| 0:24:30| excellent retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Art has served the community and commission over the past 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| In that 16 years, I would be willing to bet that he has made at least 2,976 motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| I may be underestimating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| While I haven't always agreed with this vote, Art has a great sense of planning and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| taken his position on commission seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| He oftentimes not only gives a different perspective, but good feedback with regards to the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1504)|

| 0:25:09| case and exactly why he voted the way he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| A certain commission will miss his interaction and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| This is my last Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| You're welcome, Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| This is my last Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Mayor Rojero appointed me eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Much to my surprise, I have learned so much on planning, and it's been a great honor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I'm going to miss planning, but I will be watching at least maybe the next one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| And also, I know now how my input into an item can be considered by planning and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| input can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I have selected a nominating committee to present a slate of candidates for replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1562)|
| 0:26:13| of chair and, if necessary, vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| The nominating committee is Commissioner Eason as chair, also Commissioner Smith and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| Commissioner Graf, and I wish you all very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| So, getting on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| The first item is agenda number six, rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| The applicant is Jennifer Reynolds, Baxter Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| The location is the intersection of Adair Drive and Sanders Drive, west of Tazewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| The approximate size of the tract is .28 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| The present zoning is RN4, General Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| The zoning requested is CG2, General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| The existing land use is vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| The density proposed, not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Staff recommendation is to deny CG zoning because it allows commercial uses too intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| to be located at an interior intersection at the entry of a stable single family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| and would be incompatible with the adjacent single family residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1660)|

| 0:27:48| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I do not see any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| So, Mr. Mullins, that's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you, Commissioner Toker, and I will miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1679)|

| 0:28:06| this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| This application has been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| It was initially filed back in, I believe, August of 2019 to be heard on the October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| agenda under the old city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| It was the initial recommendation from staff at that time was to approve C3 zoning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1705)|
| 0:28:35| this parcel as well as the parcel immediately to the south, the 220 Adair parcel subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Subsequent to that recommendation, there was quite a bit of neighborhood opposition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| the application with the consent of the applicant was postponed for 60 days until the January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| 2020 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| At that time, then, we were considering not C3 zoning, but CG2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| I became involved about this time and began working with the neighbors and trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| out a plan that would alleviate their concerns with what could go on to this property versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| the plan at that time was to combine both of these parcels into a single parcel for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| the Fountain City Beer Garden, is what it was going to be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| In working with the neighbors, we amended our application to get to change it from CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| to neighborhood commercial, limiting some of the uses that could be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| We were also discussing certain deed restrictions that might further alleviate the neighbors'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| One of the biggest concerns the neighborhood had was the encroachment into their residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| neighborhood, specifically with regard to the property at 220 Adair, which is part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| their historical overlay, but was owned by Baxter Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| Ultimately, the concept of the Beer Garden, because of the ongoing delays, fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And at that time, we decided it was in our best interest to leave 220 Adair as a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| buffer, not to try to change the zoning for that parcel and just focus on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| on Zero Sanders Drive, which is the RN4 zone property immediately adjacent to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| Now, the property to the east is currently zoned CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1845)|
| 0:30:54| It is owned by Baxter Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| It is the same owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| That property is under lease as soon as we get through, I guess, more of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| with the pandemic to Sweet Peas for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| The current plan for the subject property, Zero Sanders Drive, is to combine that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| the property adjacent to it under a single zone and use that as accessory parking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| our tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I've had quite a bit of conversation the last few days with staff and some emails back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| forth with staff and codes about whether this rezoning would be necessary for our intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| And it is code's interpretation that it would be that if we left it RN4 or even change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| zoning to a less intensive use, such as an office zoning, which I believe, as Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Eason or maybe Commissioner Korbelik mentioned at the pre-agenda review, might be an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| zoning for this parcel, whether or not we could then use it as an accessory parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| for the tenant on the CG2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| And it's the opinion of codes that you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| So we are still asking for the CG2 zoning for the potential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| I understand the concerns about the potential intensive uses a CG2 zone may allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| I would point out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| The sector plan in this area specifically calls for this zone to be general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1953)|
| 0:32:42| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Staff pointed out in its recommendation that the sector plan for the north city is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1963)|
| 0:32:53| of the older sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| I believe it was adopted in 2007 and is subject to be revised soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| And I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| But I'd also something the staff did not mention is that the one-year plan for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| also calls for it to be general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| And that is amended every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| You can look at the sector plan, which is actually was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| The charter of the city charter was amended in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And it states that the one-year development plan shall be the basis for zoning of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| properties within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| There were 14 amendments to the one-year plan for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| It did not include this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I think the size of this parcel limits many of the intensive uses that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| might be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| I'd point out that we haven't really had a lot of neighborhood opposition since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| withdrew our prior application and are leaving 220 Adair as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| I think Fountain City Town Hall, Ms. Malone did send in a letter that's part of your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| asking that the staff's recommendation be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| But considering the fact the one-year plan and the sector plan call for this to be CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| considering that we can't use the property as an accessory parking structure, parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| lot, excuse me, without the CG2 zoning, I would ask that you approve our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| for CG2 zoning under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| The condition that was initially, there were conditions initially placed on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| when it was recommended to be approved back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Most of those conditions related to the 220 Adair parcel and did not relate to the 0 Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| Drive parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| There was a condition for sidewalks, and there was a condition for landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| along the frontage of Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I understand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| If I could just have a couple more minutes, this is a long history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| A couple more minutes or a couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I just have one more thought to finish, Ms. Stoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2100)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I do appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| There's just a lot more history on this one than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Those, the two conditions that would still potentially apply to Sanders would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| landscaping buffer and the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I know you cannot condition rezoning at this point because of the change in the text of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| But those are things we are still agreeable to and would consider, and we would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| work with the community on making that part of this parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I think it would actually improve the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| So, we would ask with those considerations in mind that you approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| We're going to go to Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2144)|
| 0:35:54| Commissioner Corbelic, we're going to go with Mr. Green first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I caution, once again, my usual, I think, monthly caution is that when a property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| rezoned, that any use permitted in that zoning district is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| So, facing a decision on the consideration of this being a parking area only is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2170)|
| 0:36:21| entirely realistic or appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| The commission must consider all uses permitted in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And that's my monthly update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Yes, the map in my memory indicates that the houses across the street are also single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| And even if it's simply a parking lot, which, as Mr. Green said, we don't have the guarantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| for, but even if it were, you've got lighting and parked car noise and doors slamming, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| talking, I just think that a parking lot, if indeed that's what he puts in, would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| have commercial impacts on the neighborhood and also establish the entryway of that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| as kind of being a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| I appreciate the difficulty with this unusual sized lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| And I still maintain that office plan development, plan development for office, where the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2242)|
| 0:37:33| is designed to be residential in character, might be a hybrid that the owner could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2262)|
| 0:37:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| A couple of questions, and then just so I'm really clear on what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| Parcel 22, which is the one that fronts a dare, is not part of what we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| We're only considering parcel 22.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| That's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| So our GIS staff and I talked to them about amending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| They said that they prefer for it to be part of the whole record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| So if somebody goes to try to find this and planning pieces, it's got the history of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| So in this case, it's a little bit misleading for us to be looking at right now, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| is just the northernmost parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| That's the RN4, excuse me, that we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And so we're going to be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| We're going to be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| We're going to be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Okay, and my second question is, why, since the sector plan and the one-year plan both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2306)|
| 0:38:42| seem to accommodate the zoning request, why would we not consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| I mean, why is that not a good reason to consider it with the conditions that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| says he's willing to go with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Well, as he was stating, it's a really old sector plan, one-year plan, or sorry, sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2341)|
| 0:39:01| So it was updated in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| When we do the yearly updates, we basically are trying to get both plans to be in conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| with each other so that they're not in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| And so part of the sector plan update that we go through, we do that every five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| is that's when we start getting specific and looking at parcels and areas that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| changing based on trends or conditions, growth in the area, things like that, public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Their meetings have a lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| And so we gather all of those comments and things from people and kind of make it part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| of the sector plan amendment because the sector plan dives a little bit deeper and allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| us to go deeper into the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| And so the one-year plan, really, we just kind of use it to make sure that there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| conflicts and so that it can guide it in the same way that the sector plan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| It kind of helps us to avoid those conflicts in the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| So are you saying you think this sector plan zoning on this property is an error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| To me, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| I think that because it sort of rounds the corner into the neighborhood and because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| is directly across the street from residential properties, I just don't feel like a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| zoning would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I think office is a much better use because especially when you look at the intent behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| the office zone, it talks about being a transition between commercial areas and residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| And to Commissioner Korbelik's point, the parking lot with the car slamming, car doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| shutting and people talking, things like that, restaurant business largely peaks at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| and that's when people are at home and they're trying to have a peaceful evening, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| like that in their house, whereas in office, the peak time is during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| And so those noises and potential things that happen in parking lots wouldn't be as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| of a nuisance during the day if they are at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| So for those reasons, I think whenever we're looking at the sector plan to do the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| amendment, we would be looking at properties like this to see, okay, where is there some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| zoning that's not really compatible with the area around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I just think that just because the plan says that doesn't necessarily mean the plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2470)|
| 0:41:10| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Commissioner Hill, I saw your hand up and now it's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2478)|
| 0:41:18| I just, Commissioner Smith asked all the questions that were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| So I guess the staff is saying there's an error in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I definitely recognize the complexity and I see both sides to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I think that the plan for it to be a parking lot could lead to future development under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| CG2 that would be more intense than a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| So this is not a snapshot in time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| There is future precedent set for something more intense than a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Any other commissioners that care to comment or ask questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2521)|
| 0:42:11| I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So, I mean, it's this 22.01 is on Jacksboro and it actually is a piece of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2537)|
| 0:42:27| Commercial property, there are pieces adjacent to it that are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| It was a restaurant at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| Do they still have that reasonable use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Ms. Poirier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Are you talking about the property adjacent to the east on the corner of Tazewell and Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| The one in RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2573)|
| 0:42:53| So the RN4 is the one that's on, I can't see it because my participant screen's in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2573)|
| 0:43:04| That one, is that one the one that's on Adair or is that, I can't see the street numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| It's, that is the one that is, part of it is on Adair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Well, no, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Well, it's technically on Sanders and then it rounds the corners where Adair actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| starts right where the parcel ends, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| There's a building there now that used to be a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Actually, the building has been demolished and I believe it was an office before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2619)|
| 0:43:39| It was an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| I believe a dentist's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2624)|
| 0:43:44| That's the question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Okay, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| Does anyone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I'd like to make a motion to deny CGS zoning because it allows commercial uses to intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| be located at an interior intersection at the entry of a stable single-family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| and would be incompatible with the adjacent single-family residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Buston to deny CGS zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2658)|

| 0:45:03| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Moving on to agenda item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| The applicant is Taylor D. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| The location, it's the east side of North Broadway, north of Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| Approximate size of the tract is 0.79 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Present plan and zoning designation is LBR, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| RN1, Single-Family Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| The proposed plan designation is O, Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| Existing land use is vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Staff recommendation is to deny the O, Office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| since it does not meet the criteria for sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2757)|

| 0:46:56| with one beneath the corner of Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| This matter was before you in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| requesting a certain amendment sector plan, one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And a rezoning to office that was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Mr. Whaley has owned these properties for right at 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| During that time, there have been some substantial changes to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| One thing I'd like to point out is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| in relation to these changes is if you pan out on this aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| one thing you'll notice, and even if you go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| that these tracks are the only remaining residential tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| for as far as you can see, that abut Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| And that is because a residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| is no longer a viable and marketable track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| when it abuts Broadway in such a densely commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| You have a four-plus, five-plus highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| that runs through there with intense commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Mr. Whaley has tried to sell his property, his residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| but even for discounted values, and nobody will buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| The property was subdivided a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| And with this, that parcel, Mr. Whaley is requesting an office zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| which is considered to be a transition zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| in between more intensive commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| It is kind of a buffer zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Obviously, when you look at the sector plan map or the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| a strong argument could be made that even a more intensive zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| such as the CG2, would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| When you look to the south of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| we have the recent development there, that is south of Gibbs Drive there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| that is part of the same subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| That property was recently developed a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| with an office and planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Those two lots are positioned exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| They're both at Broadway at the front of the Gibbs Drive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| There's nothing different about Mr. Whaley's track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| other than there's a house on the southernmost parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| which we are not asking anything to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| We are willing to leave that residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Mr. Whaley has put in substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| over $200,000 plus to $400,000 to preserve and repair that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| to get it back to what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| So, when you look at this, in my letter dated June 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| the commissioner and I attached a staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| from the Smith-Lindsay development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| And on the top of page two of that, which is that development to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| staff noted that residential and recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| that the property is not desirable for residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Again, based on that is based on where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Staff's overall reason for this denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| comes to kind of unsupported fear and speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Whether it's the sector plan, the one-year plan or the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| the goal of Texas could cause adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Again, we would submit that the evidence is to the contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| when you consider the recent development to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| That has had no negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| and in fact has been a positive for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| In staff's site concerns that they raised in relation to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| they addressed the 100-year flood plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| and that the property, the previously approved plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| doesn't provide direct access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| As far as the access, I submitted correspondence yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| that shows a conceptually approved access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| As I explained, TDOT will not grant access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| until it has a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| What TDOT will do is they will review something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| and say this meets what are the front-end stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| that the applicant, the property has to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| to eventually gain access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| That's what we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Likewise, with the 100-year flood or the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| these things are going to be rectified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| and have to be addressed during permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| The concerns with the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| the fact that the stream separates this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| from other commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| to me, in my opinion, that we have streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| that are continuously throughout this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| that are separating commercial developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| And the fact that the property is adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| to a single-family home, this is the same owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| Mr. Whaley's idea was to offer this as a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| in a sense to maybe offer some appeasement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| to the Gibbs Drive residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| If I may just have a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Like I said, Mr. Whaley's idea was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| that this would hopefully offer some appeasement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| that this would remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| that residential access would be to Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| just for this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| There is some argument to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| that it would make sense for this more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| you know, for the entirety to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| But again, Mr. Whaley is not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Ms. Murphy, I see your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I'm assuming that you are with opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| That's correct, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Okay, before we go to the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| I'd like to hear from Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I had to unmute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Two points that Mrs. Forreston made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I'd like to address before we go to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| I'd like to address one that was the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| for the property to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Keeping in mind that those of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| who were on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| when that property was rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| there were extensive conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| placed on that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| There was a private agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| between the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| and the historic neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| addressing concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Those conditions could not be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| on rezoning now as noted by Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| in the previous request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| that the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| does not allow conditions to be placed on rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| There is another tool to address that approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| to development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So those concerns and the limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| on development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| do justify the denial of the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Also, I believe the access to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| is approved by TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| crosses a portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| to remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| It was also noted on the previous case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| parking is not permitted in a zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| which does not allow the principal use being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| There's a question that comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| is the access to parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| also considered parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| and that question needs to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| So there are a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| that still need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| to make development of this property feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| And those questions can best be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| as noted at the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| through a plan development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| And we would encourage the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| to accept staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and to direct staff to work with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| to investigate the plan development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3285)|
| 0:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Okay, we do have two in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Kevin Murphy and Steve Muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| Do you folks want to split the five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Yes, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Mr. Muffler, if you'll go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| I'll just take any remaining things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| to just address the historical district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| My name is Steve Muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| 3017 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I am a resident of the Gibbs Drive Historic Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| and also a co-chair for its Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Just as a refresher for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| that might've been on MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| when the property was split apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| the parcel that Mr. Whaley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| through the attorney, Mr. Forster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| is trying to get rezoned now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| was highly debated during that partialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| It was our contention that it was a prelude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| to Mr. Whaley wanting to try to carve out a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| and rezone it as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| And council said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| we will address that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| So now is that exact time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| And so our stance from a historic neighborhood perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| is several fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I won't repeat a lot of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| that were in planning staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| We do recommend that you deny rezoning this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| There are several salient points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| that I want to make before I turn over my time, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| So one is this home is a former Dempster mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| It is an iconic home along Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| and the gateway to not only our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| but also the Fountain City Dogwood Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| So it is very iconic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| People driving up and down Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| people turning onto the Dogwood Trail all see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| To say that it wouldn't be adversely impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| by yet another commercial development along Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I think is erroneous and it does not hold true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| And additionally, carving out this back parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| while it's allowed by right, rezoning it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| And the adverse impacts likely for yet another development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| along a tributary that leads into First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I think putting more pavement along that tributary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| in the hundred year flood would be again, short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| And wouldn't take into account the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| that there are already probably too much commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| within that flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| Also to bring up an extremely important item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| related to this property and Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| is the fact that Mr. Forrester and Mr. Whaley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| are quite aware of the court's judgment against them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| in rezoning and allowing use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| or anything other than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| All the property along Gibbs Drive with the exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| of course, those two commercial lots now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| that our office and seeing along Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| the court has upheld our deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| which were put in place in 1917| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| when this neighborhood was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| The court affirmed those residential only restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| particularly because Mr. Whaley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| and Mr. Forrester should remember this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| because he was co-counsel of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| on that decision by the appeals court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| that Mr. Whaley not be relieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| of his residential only restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| as he bought the property in only 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| knowing very well that the property was residential only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| and had other covenants assigned to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| So the fact that now he is coming full circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| we feel as though is a purposeful end run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| around the court's decision to restrict that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and allow the covenants to stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| The property across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| was also in that same lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| but because it had never had any home built on it ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| it was seen as a different circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| to release those residential only restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| So with all those considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| we would ask that you deny rezoning this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Thank you, Mr. Muffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Let's see, and I've requested to share screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| The name is Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| I'm also a former chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| of the Knox Heritage Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| And on this, I just think it's really important to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| that this property is within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| the Gibbs Drive National Register Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| The property to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| that's office and CN is outside of that historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| So it's important to consider the impact of rezoning this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| and the uses that would happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| on the integrity of the National Register Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| And then also very specifically on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| the integrity as it would spill over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| to the adjacent lot number 11 on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| So I'll just ask you, there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| and I wish I could, I can't share my screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| while somebody else is sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| but the, thank you, but the KGIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| I think is very useful to be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Now this is the Gibbs Drive National Register nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| with talks about 2805 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| The original map of the Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| National Register Historic District is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| You can see, well, this is lot number one was carved out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| and so that is within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| You can see on the other side, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Finally, just looking at KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| you know, you can see Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| the historic district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| what the boundaries are in this parcel here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| is within those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| So I just want to call your attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I do see a couple of commissioners with their hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| but we're going to go to Ms. Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Hi, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| I just had a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| There was a plat that came through yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| in a letter from Mr. Forrester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| that's different from the plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| that was part of your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| And so that shows an access point proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| that straddles the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| And as Mr. Forrester mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| TDOT wouldn't approve, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| until they get an actual project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| So anything that have to come through for access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| should the rezoning be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| would have to go through TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| But one of TDOT's points that they had asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| going back and forth with females| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I believe it was the engineer working on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| was for the access point to be 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| off of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| So the access point that's shown in that plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| wouldn't be where the access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| would likely be allowed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| It would have to be further north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| just in case anyone was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| where that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| and how that would impact properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| Unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3730)|
| 1:02:26| We still have Commissioner Clancy on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| We're gonna go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| We'll come back to you, Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| I wanted to kind of make a couple of points, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| You know, in making decisions about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| and looking at properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| and deciding what's an appropriate zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I mean, without potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I don't know the impact of restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| and the lawsuit on the other piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| but it does, it's obvious that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| when we look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| is more suited to be commercial or office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| than it is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| It's, I mean, it just screams that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| all other issues aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| The creek, I don't think the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| is much of an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| because once you have a zoning in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| you do a design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| and you can work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| and that's what the engineers do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| is they evaluate hydrology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| and how much can be filled and not filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| And that's really their purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| The driveway situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I know with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| they're gonna approve a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| based on a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| can have a plan without a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| Deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| unless this particular case is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I've always understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| that we are not to consider deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| in our land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| But maybe this is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| And the last point I would make is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| regardless of what happens today on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| that is a beautiful home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| and it's a historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| And I think the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| and the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| need to find a new use for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| if anything, to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| To me, an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| converting that into an office use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| it could be a real estate office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| or insurance office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| it could be maintained landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| And preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| But, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| major rentals on Bearden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| that beautiful historic home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| that has been converted to an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| it's kind of a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3882)|
| 1:04:42| for these historic structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| to have a next 50 years of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| But it seems that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| if you leave it residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| they just, they languish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| and they do what this is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| This one's come back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| and this guy's struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3897)|
| 1:04:57| to try to find a way to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| So I would advise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| no matter what happens today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| it would be great to look at a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| maybe an office use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| for that whole parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| to preserve the house, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Going back to Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| I apologize, I had a pop-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| I couldn't get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| That's basically what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| My biggest problem with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| is the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| my access to Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Like Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| this piece of property would be great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| I mean, for an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| But in order to preserve the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| it's a beautiful house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| I just, and without having access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| off of Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I just don't see that this is doable for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| And I'll let other commissioners speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| I actually agree with the fundamental analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| But the difficulty is the sensitivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| that this particular lot has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| in relation to the historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| And I just would like to ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| to work very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| with the planning department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| to see what use can be made of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| and work intensively with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| May I also add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| I believe we got a letter from a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| who stated that because the CG2 was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| that that represented a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| And I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I want to just take for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| because the property has four sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| and only one side was converted to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Nothing else has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| And I don't consider that a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| I just wanted to get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| So I'm feeling that it's a difficult piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| and they need to work closely with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| and the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| I wanted to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| when this came before us a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| with the discussion of splitting into two parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| I realized there's not much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| we don't have much room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| to make that decision as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| but there was much discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| because of the importance of having this say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| it's an entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| and the importance of the size of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| And I think it's for the historic perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| from the floodplain perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| from the entrance to Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| that the house and rest of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| be used in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| For something that preserves the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| rather than putting commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| right at the back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| Thank you, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Yes, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| that we deny the O office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Second by Commissioner Eason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| to deny the office designate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| Yes, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| would maybe tabling be a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| than to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| and give the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| and any owner and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| opportunity to see if they can't come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| with something that would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| work on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| Rather than postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| or deny when they'd have to reapply again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| I think maybe the table would be a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| We do have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Is there any, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| This is in response to Commissioner Graf's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Tabling or postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| especially postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| would just bring us back to the same point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| that there's the issues that have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| by the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Preservation of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| protection of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| the resolution of the access question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| are not addressed at a rezoning level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| The plan development approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| is a tool that would enable all those to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| So if the owner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| desirous of developing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| and addressing the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| expressed by the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| bringing back something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| that does indeed address those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| and presents an avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| for development of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| the plan development process is a way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| not a postponement or tabling of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| I hope that answers Commissioner Graf's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Commissioner Graf, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| It was just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Yes, I would like to go on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| that I would really support the office zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| I mean, everything Commissioner Smith said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| makes perfect sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| You know, when you do have properties like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| and we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| there's commercial all around this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| they do tend to languish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| especially if there can be something put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| to make a nice development around preserving that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| But, you know, the trend around that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| And I think we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I think we do the community really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| I know there's a lot of opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| but the community of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| by zoning this property office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| and allowing progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| you know, to a nicer looking development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I think that one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Ms. Green has been emphasizing a couple of times here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| is with the newly adopted ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| there is other options for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| with the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| And I would hope that the applicant may look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| should this not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| I would hope that the applicant would look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| because there are a lot of opportunities within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Yeah, you're going right down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| I was going to recommend the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| And I don't know if Beth mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I'd like to see both the house and this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| and it's more of an application for a plan zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| and overall way to save the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| and do both those lots as one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| I think would be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| unless anybody thinks I'm out of line on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I just wanted to tell Commissioner Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| that I totally agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Smith, totally agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| You could get an extremely attractive office use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| if you combine the two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| and look at the relationship to the historic housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| You could come up with something really swell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| It will take some thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Clancy, you still have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| I just want to make sure that you don't have anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| to add to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| And you're muted and maybe you've got a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I've got my hand up to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| So we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| a second by Commissioner Eason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| to deny the office designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Roll call, please, Mr. Weiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4409)|

| 1:14:12| A whole bunch of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Okay, a whole bunch of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| We do have two other votes on this plan amendment and rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| I'm sorry, I should have read both of those into the record at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| But this is also agenda item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| And the location is, again, this is the plan amendment and rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| Location is east side of North Broadway, north of Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Track information, 0.79 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Present plan designation and zoning is LDR, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| RN1, single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| Proposed plan designation and zoning is O office, O office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Existing land use is vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| Staff recommendation is there will be two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| Mr. Wise, could we combine both of these since the, since we denied the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Could we combine these both into one motion or does it have to be two motions, two votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| You can combine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| If the motion comes forward to deny both elements, then you can vote on that appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4528)|
| 1:15:28| So, yes, should the motion come forward to deny both elements, we can vote as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| But the staff recommendation is to deny the O office designation since it does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| the criteria for the one year plan amendments and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| And the second recommendation is to deny O office zoning because it is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| with the North City sector plan designation and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Since we've already voted on the office designation for the sector plan, I guess we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4563)|
| 1:16:12| a motion to deny the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| And we can, we can combine that into two to design, to deny both the plan amendment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| We have a motion by Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| The plan amendment and rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4595)|

| 1:17:32| of this and for this, something to work out for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| Appreciate all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4661)|

| 1:17:47| Two motions is a plan amendment and rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4667)|

| 1:18:02| Track information is two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| The proposed plan designation and zoning is NC Neighborhood Commercial, CN Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| The proposed plan designation and zoning is MDR Medium Density Residential, PR Planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| The existing land use is single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| The density proposed is 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| There will be two motions, two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4712)|

| 1:18:51| types of residential housing are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| And MDR is a transitional land use classification between commercial development and low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Also, the second recommendation is to approve PR Planned Residential zoning up to 12 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| units per acre because the northwest county sector continues to need additional opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| for a variety of residential housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4756)|

| 1:19:50| aimed at, you know, first time workers, basically a workforce housing type project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| Similar to what's being done up in Pigeon Forge and a couple of other areas around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| region for this area and felt like this would be a good use for this property at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4803)|

| 1:20:40| Sector Plan to MDR medium density residential because the additional opportunities for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| variety of types of residential housing are needed and MDR is a transitional land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4845)|

| 1:21:00| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I'm just struggling to get comfortable with the density as I look around the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| excluding the trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| I just, I don't see where, you know, where this fits within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| So I, you know, I could even get more comfortable with a little bit less density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| which would be more than, you know, the LDR, but I just struggle with the 12 breakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4885)|
| 1:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4893)|

| 1:21:36| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| We talked about that at the preliminary agenda meeting and one thought that was floated out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| for discussion was that by providing them the ability for maximum density doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| they're necessarily coming in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| It might give them some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| But my question was, I think we received quite a few letters regarding flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Dutchtown flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| Does staff have a response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| Sorry, this is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4934)|

| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| So we've reached out to county engineering regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| Send an email to county stormwater engineering staff to kind of get their opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| And I believe if they're on this call, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| defer to them for any issues regarding stormwater in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Yeah, this is Leo Kammerer with Knox County Engineering, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4961)|

| 1:23:00| but I don't see any issues with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| Sorry, any other questions for staff regarding this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=4997)|
| 1:23:30| Yeah, I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Is there public transit out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| So there isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| We looked at what the nearest stop would be, and it seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| out at the intersection with Cedar Bluff and Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| And that is about 1.2 miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| So a little bit further out of the realm of what a walkable distance is to a transit stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5033)|
| 1:24:01| But given the growth in Northwest County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| and the adjacency to the urban growth area for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| I mean, you know, if we continue to see trends the way they are in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| you know, I could see a potential extension in the future of a transit line down Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5054)|
| 1:24:26| Any other questions of staff before Mr. Green speaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| Mr. Green, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Yeah, I'm unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| This is in response to our answer to Commissioner Hill's question regarding the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| Keep in mind that this is a two-part request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| with the next part setting the zoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| And so the zoning does not have to be 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| If the commission feels more comfortable with a lesser density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| but still in that medium density range of 6 to 12 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| you have the opportunity to address the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| when establishing or approving the zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Yeah, I've got some problems with this, some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| first of all, and then a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| But for the applicant, 24 units or 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| what kind of building do you anticipate being able to fit on this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| How many stories would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| What are you planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| There would be, currently, we're looking at two-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| two, possibly three smaller buildings to kind of reduce the overall perceived density of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| But we are looking at doing 24 units in probably two to three buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| and pushing it off to one side or separating them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| leaves us plenty of room for any detentions of landscaping buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| or anything like that to make it not look like a gigantic apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| And then you can park 24 units on the remainder of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Okay, my second, my concern is just the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| I don't, you know, this zone is a transitional zone between commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| I don't really see any commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Secondly, I don't see justification for a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| I mean, if it's just the area is growing, then that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| all over West Knoxville should be changed because when you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| But I just don't see, I don't see a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Leo said it was 12 to 15 years since it was improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| I just feel like this is a little out of place where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| So I'm still kind of struggling to get a handle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| But I know there's a house right behind this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| And I just, I'm just not sure how compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| this high density or medium density is in this area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5232)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Similarly to Mr. Smith and Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| I'm a little uncomfortable with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I think 12 units per acre is a little bit high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| especially when you look around and you see density in the four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| four and a half to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| Then we jump up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| It's, that's a little stretch, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Okay, Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Sorry, this is staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| This is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I just have a point of information to provide related to the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| The Dutch Town Villas, which are relatively nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| that was a use on review that came through back in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| It was for a 5.7 acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| And for that use on review application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| they were looking at building at 10 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| Their actual build out though is 7.36 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| They have 42 units and nine structures on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| The Eagles Landing Mobile Home Park is 8.76 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| and they have approximately 44 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| So that gives them about five and a half dwelling units an acre for their density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5313)|
| 1:28:40| So just a point of information for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| since it's not clear from the zoning what the build outs are at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| I'm in agreement with Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| I believe this is a large density for this neighborhood, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| Number two, like Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| I just don't see the trend from this neighborhood into that large a complex, that many units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5353)|
| 1:29:24| Because there's no commercial around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| So I'm having a problem with it because of the transition for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5368)|
| 1:29:37| It just looks out of place to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5383)|
| 1:29:43| Commissioner Rockhurst and then Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| One of the things I was listening to Commissioner Buston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| it is zone neighborhood commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| And I think we were talking the other day about it being used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| But I think the development that's happened along Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| which is not too far from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| really negates this property from being used for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| Because people can drive right down to Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and there's all kinds of shops and stores and restaurants that they can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| So I think this is a good use for this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| And I don't see it ever getting developed into a neighborhood commercial type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5439)|
| 1:30:39| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I have to agree with Commissioner Buston and Hill and Smith and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| And just to point out, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| with regard to the two pieces of property, the mobile home park in orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| that is down in a valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| It's not easily seen by the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| And then when you go up to the top of the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| I forget the name of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| That one is highly covered in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| Pretty entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5472)|
| 1:31:12| And it's all hidden back in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| Everything else along there is just single residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| So those two, while they are there, they're just sort of tucked away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| This one is just right on the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| And it's just quite an intense density, in my opinion, for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5489)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| And again, as Mr. Green pointed out, we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| the first motion is with regards to the motion that's on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| is with regards to amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| Commissioner Kulbelic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Yes, with your permission, I'd like to direct a question to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Oh, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| It's two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| I was wondering how close it is to the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| And I was wondering if there was a density that staff might recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| that might be less than 12, but not single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Lois has pulled up the map that shows the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| a bit to the south of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Which one's the urban growth boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| I see all kinds of dotted lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| So just immediately to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| If we can turn on, if you go down to where zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| and you click on the gray base map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| you can see the urban growth boundary more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| And it's just the other side of Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| And density, given the numbers that Les pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| for the Dutchtown Villas and the mobile home park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| eight, seven to nine, eight units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| If that makes, if that is comfortable for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| and the commissioners feel that makes a good transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| from the existing development to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| and the urban growth boundary and points away to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| and allows a reasonable development at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Yes. Did that answer your question, Commissioner Kerbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5628)|
| 1:33:48| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| I realize we'll probably be discussing this in the next motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| but I could get much more comfortable around that seven per acre number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5642)|
| 1:34:02| We do have a motion on the floor, second by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| second by Commissioner Roth to adopt resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| And Commissioner Clancy did give a reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| the amend, amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| I think that, Commissioner Kerbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| So the motion is to approve the sector plan or to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| The motion is to approve the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| So, so we will, there'll be two motions, two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| One is with regards to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| And then the other is with regards to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| So that'll be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Remind, what was the justification on sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| It was as is in the staff recommendation, which is because additional opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| for a variety of types of residential housing are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| And MDR is a transitional land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| between commercial development and low density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| No other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| Mr. Wise, call the vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5726)|

| 1:35:48| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5751)|

| 1:36:00| Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5760)|

| 1:36:03| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Mr. Kerbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5774)|
| 1:36:14| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5774)|

| 1:36:17| Mr. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| Eight five passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Okay. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| We're moving on to the next staff recommendation with regards to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| up to 10 dwelling units per acre because the northwest county sector plan continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| need additional opportunities for a variety of residential housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| And this area is adjacent to the urban area growth area for Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| to approve planned residential up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Yes, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| When we're voting on density, we need to be very careful because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| if we vote for 10, they'll come back and ask up to doesn't hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5844)|
| 1:37:32| If we vote for 10, they're going to come back for 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| If we vote for seven, they'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Maybe they won't want seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| But, you know, when we say up to, we're really saying this is about what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5862)|
| 1:37:53| It is not going to be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| It's not going to be seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| It'll be up to 10 or 12 or wherever we put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| So we just need to be careful that might be voting on 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5882)|
| 1:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| We're going to get seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| Unmute Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| You're still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Yeah, I can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| I just want to encourage other commissioners to consider maybe a lower number if this fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| like seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5926)|
| 1:38:46| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5932)|
| 1:38:52| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| Yeah, I just wanted to add that this is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| So to come back to us, and I think that 10 dwelling units per acre with one bedroom units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| will look very different than seven dwelling units with two or three bedrooms per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5943)|
| 1:39:11| So I think we have a chance to consider that when it comes back to us as planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| to see what it really looks like and how large are those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5963)|
| 1:39:23| Commissioner Corbelic, you turned off your hand or you lowered your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I just want to do a backup Commissioner Hill on the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| I like that number better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I see no, Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| Yes, I'd like to amend Mr. Smith's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| So number of units would be eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| You cannot amend someone else's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Commissioner, you can either vote for the motion that's on the table or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| If the motion fails, then another motion can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| But currently, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| to approve up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6009)|

| 1:41:14| Okay, the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| And so that is up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| As Commissioner Eason said, you guys will see this again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| That's 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6087)|

| 1:41:38| Before we continue on, we have made it through three agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| We've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6103)|

| 1:41:59| Let's say an 8-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| We'll re-adjourn at 3.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6121)|

| 1:42:13| Okay, are we all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6133)|

| 1:42:29| I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| We're moving on to agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| This is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| The applicant is Benjamin C. Mullins, OVO Villa Colina, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6158)|
| 1:42:46| The location is the southeast side of Lyons View Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| northeast of its intersection with Harley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| The approximate size of the tract is 8.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| The present zoning is RN1, Single-Family Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| HP Hillside Protection Overlay and F Floodway Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| The zoning requested is AG Agricultural, HP Hillside Overlay and F Floodway Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| Existing land use is rural residential and water, the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| The staff recommendation is to approve AG Agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| because it's consistent with the West City Sector Plan's LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| Low Density Residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6218)|

| 1:43:59| Mr. Mullins, do you want to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| I'll let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Okay, so we're going to start with you, Ms. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Thank you for allowing me and a few other neighbors the opportunity today to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| about a rezoning effort on our scenic and historic Lyons View Pike neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| I believe around 22 emails were sent and 10 calls made against a rezoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| from residential to agriculture in reference to Mr. Eric Barton's residence and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6265)|

| 1:44:44| I think you have to look at how many ways people on Lyons View said, no, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6284)|

| 1:46:13| I vehemently oppose, 5804 Lyons View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| Mr. Barton has told me personally on several occasions that he bought Villa Colina with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| the intention of reselling the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Unfortunately, it has been on the market for over a year and has not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| Opening the opportunity to have an agricultural zoning allows for what Mr. Barton has also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| discussed doing with several people, which is hosting special events in order to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| the cost of maintaining the largest house in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| Having a possible reception facility completely goes against the character of our residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| We are not a revenue-producing neighborhood utilizing our homes or property for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| Agriculture zoning would allow this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| There are nine taxpaying residents, which are direct neighbors of Villa Colina versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| having a neighbor on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6425)|

| 1:47:26| There are actually seven driveways within this particular area servicing 11 residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| including Mr. Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| The report also states there is ample room for guest parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| No, there is not ample room for parking for special events or events that would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| than 50 people or 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| The report also states there for this guest parking, Mr. Barton has to use other sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| for parking cars during his events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| The report also says the proposed amendment to ag zoning is intended for a wide range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6473)|
| 1:48:01| of agricultural and related uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6481)|

| 1:48:11| The report also states the uses allowed in the agricultural zone are compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| This is a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| With agriculture zoning, Mr. Barton or the next owner would not need to get permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6501)|

| 1:49:00| I know that you had your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| I'd like to give you two minutes, so could you please add two minutes to the applicant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| time as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Mr. Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| I assume you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| I won't take two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Ms. Ford has stated it very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| I'm at 5617 Lion's View Pike and my wife and I are opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| The reasons have been stated in the many emails and phone messages, excuse me, that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| I think the overall thing is, as somebody has already said, you have to consider all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| the uses under agricultural, despite what the applicant says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| He's only going to use it for, we know it's for sale and who knows what the next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| will do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| And agricultural, if there's one place it doesn't fit whatsoever, it's on Lion's View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| Pike and as all the neighbors unanimously have objected to having this rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| So we ask that you please do not rezone it to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6602)|
| 1:50:08| That's a scenic route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| It's been a scenic route for almost 50 years, I believe, back in the 70s when that became,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| early 70s, and that became a scenic route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| It is a, one of, I think, of course, I'm prejudiced, a premier road, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6618)|
| 1:50:25| Lion's View Pike, and it should remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| And that's what we want it to do, is to remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6634)|
| 1:50:34| I appreciate, Madam Chair, your service and also Commissioner Clancy for your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| long service and all the rest of you for what you do for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6644)|
| 1:50:44| I appreciate your consideration of our request that this application be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| Thank you very much, Mr. Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Thank you, and thank you, Ms. Ford and Mr. Stair for your comments and all the emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| We are very sensitive to those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| I'll remind the commission that presently I had asked that this be postponed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| because of the comments I've received from the neighbors and the conversations I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| with Mr. Stair and others so that those concerns can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| This is a very unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| It is, has been advertised, the largest home in Tennessee at over 40,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| It has eight bedrooms in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| Mr. Barton, who purchased it in 2016, has invested over $11 million into this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6697)|
| 1:51:45| and has held several private events and several fundraising events over the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6705)|
| 1:51:54| In fact, I believe at least 26 fundraising events have been held on the property for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| Maryville College, the Opera Guild, Marine Corps Ball, Second Harvest Food Bank, Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6721)|
| 1:52:10| He has opened his home up to the community to allow the unique nature of this property to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| used to help raise money for charities and causes within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| His request, it goes back into when he first purchased the property in 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| under the old zoning ordinance when Mr. Seymour explored options of ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| he could have limited commercial events to go along with his already private events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| to help offset the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| There was not an option or a tool available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| Last year when the new zoning ordinance was making its way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| the City Council and the Planning Commission, the concept of a planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| tool became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| And at that time, before the zoning ordinance was adopted, I had conversations with Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| about that tool being a way where we could have limited commercial events where the scope and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6783)|
| 1:53:12| intensity of those events are no greater than what is already happening there on a private level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| but also address potential concerns with the impact to the community and what could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| if the property sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Once the zoning passed and the planned development approval process was actually part of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| I went back to the Planning Department and actually met with them several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| ultimately met with them, the legal department and codes about a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| At that time, looking at what we intended to do, it was suggested that perhaps a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| would be something we could do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| I know Mr. Green has expressed some concerns with our ability to meet the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| I have expressed my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| I think that we could meet those elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| But we thought we'd try the rezoning process first since that was actually suggested to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| We have not been trying to do an end around of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| I think Mr. Barton has been very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| As Ms. Ford said, he has indicated he would like to be able to offset some of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| A home this large, his utility costs are over $6,000 a month alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| That's not to mention the other areas that maintenance, taxes, his annual budget is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6876)|
| 1:54:47| half a million dollars just for the upkeep of this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| So he would like to at least offset some of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| Otherwise, a piece of property like this, it's difficult to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| It's difficult for anyone to afford to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| We would like to avoid it not being used at all, such as the Eugenia Williams Manor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| So that was the concept behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| We want to be sensitive to the neighbor's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| I think Mr. Barton has been very open with them and speaking with them about what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| We would like to have an opportunity to talk to them, to talk to them more, to see if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| are ways we can address their present concerns and their concerns moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| We don't want this to become a giant event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| We don't want this to change the neighborhood, the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| There are lots of uses in the agricultural zone that are potential, but that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| drastically changing this lot and practically no one can envision that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| So at this stage, I think there is a lot of conversation that needs to be had moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| so we can come up with something that makes sense for both the property owner and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6963)|
| 1:56:03| And that's why we're asking for a postponement of at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| As I look at this case here, one, I'm glad it's not postponed because I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| anything changing that would create a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| So as I look at the land use classification, the very first part has location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6987)|
| 1:56:36| with three bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Farms and large tracts of undeveloped land, land where the U.S. Department of Agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=6997)|
| 1:56:46| important and rural areas prime for conservation such as forests, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| I don't see any of that fitting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| And then I look at the purpose under the zoning district and it's for agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| I understand why lodging and meeting halls are allowed on large tracts of land in rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7021)|
| 1:57:10| areas or farm settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Uh, this feels like we're trying to reverse it and then retrofit it and it just doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7033)|
| 1:57:21| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| The argument about Cherokee Country Club, they've been there since 1907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| So everybody that came after them knew what they were getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| I've heard three references to operating offsetting operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| I'm sure the homeowner knew what his operating costs were going into the purchase of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| and it shouldn't be a factor in which we should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| So I just, I just think the intent doesn't fit and I don't see anywhere in our land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| or purpose of the zoning district that would give us any reason to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| I hear a motion coming out of that statement or just a thank you for prompting me and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| would make a motion to deny the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Hill, a second by Commissioner Phillips jumped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| there first to deny the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| Commissioner Buston, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| I just wanted to echo Commissioner Hill's all of his points that he made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| I think this is just, I agree, Mr. Barton must have known what he was getting into when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7109)|
| 1:58:38| he bought this large home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| And I don't think the neighborhood should have to suffer for him to be able to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| an event center or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| I've been to several fundraisers there and I was shuttled in to that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| So what worries me is parking, more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| I just, I just am totally against this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7141)|

| 2:07:06| Mr. Tipton, is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| And Mr. Ambrose, also opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7631)|
| 2:07:18| Mr. Ambrose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| You are also in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Yes, can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Okay, Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| I'll let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7657)|
| 2:07:37| Okay, so you folks want to share the five minutes of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| Do you want me to prompt you when we're at two minutes, 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| I'd like to have adequate time to finish my talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| I'm not willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7672)|
| 2:07:52| I think neither of us should have to split our time unless it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| That is the guidelines for our commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| At any time, any commissioner can request that you be provided additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7684)|
| 2:08:13| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Could you please give them an additional two minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| Okay, so you'll have seven minutes total to split between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| And I will alert you when we're at three minutes, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| So Mr. Tipton, if you would like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7724)|
| 2:08:44| Thank you, Madam Chair and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| My name is Hanson Tipton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| I live at 1515 Dunwoody Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| My property shares a border with the parcel that is the subject of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| Our neighborhood is called Dunbarton Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| It's uphill and upstream from the subject parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| Last week, several of my neighbors and I and Dr. Ambrose met with Mr. Smith and Mr. Mosley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| along with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| And at the meeting, the developers told us about their general plans for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| but told us there was not a concept plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| We understand that without a concept plan, some of our concerns are theoretical at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| but we want the commission to be aware of them at every step of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| During the meeting, we informed Commissioner Smith and his team about environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| we were aware of on both the property that he was planning to develop and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| These issues include sinkholes, caves, and regular flooding problems, as well as a stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| that crosses the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| And we relayed this information not only for Commissioner Smith's benefit, but also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| protect our own property as development downhill and downstream from us could adversely impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| The subject parcel is riddled with sinkholes, as well as a flowing stream across the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| This network of sinkholes has served for decades as a natural stormwater drainage system for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| the entire valley south of North Shore that our neighborhood and the subject parcel sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| Our neighborhood was built on top of similar land with its own sinkholes, and when our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| neighborhood was built by developer Steve Williams, it caused considerable flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| problems and damage to surrounding properties, including that of Mrs. Hunter, who was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| owner of this property at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| In fact, she was forced to sue Mr. Williams in 1995 because of the flooding effects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| the development of Dunbarton Oaks had on her adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| Since its construction, our neighborhood has consistently suffered problems caused by building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| on this land, from sinkhole damage to foundation problems to severe flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| I personally have spent approximately $16,000 on my own property to combat these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| and many of my neighbors have spent considerable money on similar crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| If we ignore the mistakes that were made by Steve Williams and repeat them, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| development of this land is not done responsibly with careful attention paid to its effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| on stormwater drainage, it will directly harm my property and that of my neighbors, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| it will create an entire new neighborhood full of sinkholes and flooding problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| It will cost the county significant money to address these problems that it did when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| a culvert had to be constructed under North Shore to address Mrs. Hunter's flooding problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| when Dunbarton Oaks was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| I note that in Mr. Smith's June 9 letter to the commission, he states that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| none of these issues are caused by or could be contributed to from the development of our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| Surely Mr. Smith is aware that development of this land could disrupt the natural flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| of stormwater from our land and cause us to address issues when that flow is disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| My neighbors and I suggest it would be appropriate to perform a geotechnical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| survey of this land so that we have an opportunity to review its results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| and consult with our own engineers regarding the impact that developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| this land will have on our own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| I realize I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| I also want to note that the staff recommendation notes that the area around this parcel is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| out at well under the density that it is zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| Dunbarton Oaks, in fact, is built out at a density of 2.26 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| And as Commissioner Graf said earlier in this meeting, voting for, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| up to a number is just as good as voting for that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Based on, I realize I'm out of time here, so I would ask, I would request of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| for me and my neighbors in Dunbarton Oaks that if this property is rezoned that it be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| so at a lower density than four dwelling units per acre and also that it be rezoned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| conditions requiring investigation and accommodation of drainage issues that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| are already suffering that would be made worse by development of this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Before we go to you, Mr. Ambrose, I'd like to get some information from County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| with regards to the flooding issues that Mr. Tickton referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=7994)|
| 2:13:31| Somebody from County Engineering available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| And Madam Chair, I would add that this property was, there was an application for rezoning two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| years ago in 2018 and that case file, it was my impression that that case file was available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| all of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| If that's not the case, we would like to provide a lot of the photographs and video and description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| of the problems we've had because those were submitted back in 2018 when there was a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| application filed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| While we're waiting for, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| Yeah, this is Lee Elder Cam with County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| I lost control of the remote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Was aware of, was aware there was drainage issues in Dunbarton Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| The developer of this property would obviously have to have a drainage system sized adequately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8066)|
| 2:14:33| you know, to convey that water through the site and then it goes under North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| to the north side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| So that would be part of the concept plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| Yes, and your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8091)|

| 2:14:59| I sent an email to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| I hope they have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8102)|

| 2:15:16| As you drive west on North Shore Drive after the Rocky Hill intersection, you come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| top of the hill where there is Arrowwood subdivision and Aldenwood subdivision, Aldenwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| These were built in 1950 with no stormwater consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| The water was just pumped to the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| That involved Dunbarton Oaks when it was built in the mid-1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| Unfortunately, there were some terrible engineering mistakes with Dunbarton Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8141)|

| 2:15:59| water that's coming down from the higher elevations of Arrowwood and Aldenwood, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| did not get to the retention ponds because the pipes to the retention ponds went uphill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| This was documented by the city engineering in about mid-2000, and they came up with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Their answer was to take a big concrete pipes from the street drains at Dunwood and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| them run perpendicular down to the west property line of Dunbarton Oaks and dump all that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8188)|
| 2:16:37| onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| So when you start from the top of Arrowwood and Aldenwood, there is no retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| The engineer that just talked, he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| There was so much water that drained onto the front of this property that they had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| drill a stormwater drain under North Shore Drive that went over to Lines Crossing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| dumped the water into a creek there, which increased the runoff down to our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| So the point of all this is that we are not, I am not objecting to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8230)|
| 2:17:17| I am just concerned that the buck is going to continually be passed down to the lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| property owners, which I am a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| And the engineering has not adequately addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| There's going to have to be some retention ponds in this piece of property that can handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| all that water that's coming down that was not handled in Dunbarton Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| So we're not objecting to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| I'm not here as an opposition to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| I'm here to an opposition to irresponsible development with engineering inadequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| or engineering that does not recognize the severity of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| The situation at the current time is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| It's terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| We're flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| We have water that comes down in a rain from way up here through Dunbarton Oaks, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| this property and goes above our road at Ashland Springs and makes it impassable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| This water continues to run all the way down to Bluegrass Lake and is part of the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| at Whittington Creek and Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| The way the water runs in this situation is everything from Wrights Ferry back goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8303)|
| 2:18:32| to the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| Once you pass Rutter Lane coming west on North Shore, everything goes to Bluegrass Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| Thank you, Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| I know that from what Knox County Engineering just said that at the time of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8322)|
| 2:18:52| concept plan that there will be adequate review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| And I know since 1990, there's been quite a bit of change to the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8337)|
| 2:19:09| what happens with the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| And Leo, could you kind of reiterate what the stormwater ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8351)|
| 2:19:23| Yeah, there's a range of storms for the one year to the 100 year that has to be released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| at no more than the pre-development rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| If there is a lot of offsite drainage, that's something that they'll have to contend with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| during the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Well, I'm just worried that we'll have to, I just hope that we'll have attention paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8385)|
| 2:19:45| I don't want to get on record as opposing the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| I have great admiration for Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| And we're actually pleased that he may be developing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| And hopefully in a responsible way where the people down below who are damaged at the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| time, the water will not be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| So my consideration is a stormwater problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| And I'd like to, if possible, just echo what Dr. Ambrose just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| When we met with Commissioner Smith and Mr. Mosley, who were planning to develop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| we were encouraged by our meeting with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| They seemed receptive to our concerns and willing to work with us to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| We hope to be able to continue that good relationship as this project goes forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| in whatever form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| We just wanted to urge the commission to protect our rights as property owners and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| of the county and ensure that any development is done in a manner that does not compound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| the issues we are already having with our stormwater problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| I'm sorry, who was just talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| That was Mr. Tifton again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Your square did not light up for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| Okay, we have heard from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Let's hear from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| Mr. Smith and Mr. Mosley did meet with Mr. Ambrose, Mr. Tipton, and others about these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| Mr. Tipton mentioned there are other people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| That person was actually the engineer that will be working on the concept plan for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| as it moves forward, if it moves forward on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| That was David Harbin with Batson, Hines, Norvell, and Poe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| They brought him so he could specifically hear the concerns that the neighbors upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| and downstream were having, so those can be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| This is a request for a planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| The planned residential zone is intended to encourage imaginative solutions to environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| design problems, which is what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| No doubt there's been stormwater issues with developments that occurred in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| It is our aim not to repeat those mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| The developers have learned a lot from past development mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| The county engineers have learned a lot from past mistakes, and the stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| in place now are significantly more robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| These are all issues that we will continue to work with the neighborhood on as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| forward, when we move forward with the concept plan, when we work with our engineers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| county engineering with regard to exactly how this property can be developed with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| of these concerns in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| The request is for four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| The request in 2018 was for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| That was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| Staff's recommendation after looking at the hillside protection analysis, they came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8570)|
| 2:22:57| with 4.06 dwelling units an acre, so this is right in line with the guidelines the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| has in what to recommend as far as density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| It may or may not be built out at four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| We don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| There are certainly several things that are going to have to occur moving forward at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| planned residential stage and use on review stage to see exactly how it can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| and how we can address these concerns, but we're aware of them, and we are committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| to continuing to work with Mr. Tipton, Mr. Ambrose, and others to address them moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| We would ask that this commission follow staff's recommendation and approve the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| at four dwelling units an acre, and let us get to work on addressing these issues moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Mr. Harbin, you've got your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8626)|
| 2:23:53| Mr. Harbin, did you have something you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| Sir Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8641)|
| 2:24:01| Yes, I've been engaged by Estimate Properties here to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| We did show up at the community meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| We're aware of the problems that are in Dunbarton Oaks and being downstream, but again, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| assure those residents that we will not exacerbate any of their drainage problems that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| currently having in their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| We'll have free flow from their property to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| And as Ms. Gillicamera said, we'll have to make stormwater ordinances to cause a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| of different storms and different events that we would have to meet before passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| it on to the downstream neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| So with the current regulations and what's out there right now, we're aware of the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| problems, and we can assure the Dunbarton Oaks crowd that nothing there that we do will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| affect their stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| Thank you very much for adding that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| That's valuable for us as we are making our deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| I'm going to go to Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| Yes, thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| I'm very familiar with Dunbarton Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| To call that a fiasco is probably generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| I don't see how it ever got through Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| It's been horrible since it was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| That being said, I don't think anything done on the adjacent park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| property is going to exacerbate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| But I do want to say to Mr. Tipton and Dr. Ambrose, this is to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8735)|
| 2:25:43| They have to come back with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| And to be honest with you, if I was in your situation, and I had Scott Smith and David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| Harbin working on that piece of property, I think you're going to find that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| to do a lot better job and probably help the situation that you're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR planned residential zoning with up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| dwelling units per acre because it's consistent with the southwest county sector plans, low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| density residential designation, and it's compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| to approve the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| Commissioner Kobelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| Yes, if I may, I'd like to raise a question to the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8793)|
| 2:26:41| Yes, that's Leo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Yes, I understand from the testimony that the county engineering standards will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8802)|
| 2:26:52| that runoff does not exceed pre-development levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| My question, though, is are you going, do the county standards require that any runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8816)|
| 2:27:05| crossing their property onto the property to the south or other adjacent property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| Can the county require that that also be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| The total flow from their site can't exceed that pre-development rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| I had anticipated that the flow probably would be directed to the culvert under North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| Drive and into where Brenton Boulevard is there, that drainage way that goes that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8849)|
| 2:27:36| But that would be, you know, David Harburn would have to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| I'm no engineer, and I just wanted to make sure that if there was an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| this development to correct a neighborhood or regional problem, you know, within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| confines of their work, that they address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8872)|
| 2:27:57| Well, they have to deal with any runoff that enters the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| They have to deal with their own runoff and any runoff that comes from above them, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| know, would obviously have to be dealt with as part of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| Even though that runoff is occurring at pre-development levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| they can bypass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| But yeah, they have to treat the site, their site has to be released at the pre-development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| Well, I just hope the applicant understands my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| I'm just, my point is that the pre-development rate sounds like it could be a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| And I was hoping that we could actually correct the problems at the pre-development rate if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| they are occurring on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| Correcting the problems at the pre-development rate if they are occurring on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Engineering, is this something that is currently, I have not been out to this property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8931)|
| 2:28:59| based on all the discussion, it sounds like the development with Dunwoody Boulevard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8939)|
| 2:29:11| that there still is issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| Are there still issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| I know that because that was done in 1990, that was before all the stormwater ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8956)|
| 2:29:23| and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| So is there additional water that is coming off that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| Is there still, is there issues with that development ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| This development shouldn't exacerbate anything because it's downstream of Dunwoody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| And Dunwoody is kind of complicated too because the front half is in the city and the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| half is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| So that doesn't answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| I think that what Commissioner Kobelik is asking is right now, there seems to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| issues with the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9002)|
| 2:30:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9009)|
| 2:30:16| Right now, there is currently issues with stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| Yes, I think there's some undersized drainage pipes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| And I think that Commissioner Kobelik is asking with this development, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9027)|
| 2:30:36| that issue be taken into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| And I understand that you're saying that because this is downstream, that it's not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9041)|
| 2:30:48| But I'm just wondering if there's some opportunities for fixing what's wrong now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9048)|
| 2:30:58| It's something that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| And I don't know if most of the problems are in the city portion or the county portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| Is it possible for me to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| Is this Mr. Ambrose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| Yes, this is Mr. Ambrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| We got a motion on the floor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| Janice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| Yes, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| I think with David Harbin and that engineering firm and Scott Smith, I think that they're known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9091)|
| 2:31:44| for doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| I don't have any problem voting for this, although we thought that the water couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9112)|
| 2:32:03| be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| But if David Harbin and the county engineers think it can be handled, I think that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| The people involved will do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| And again, this will be coming back before commission once the concept plan is put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9137)|
| 2:32:24| So we do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| planned residential with up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9149)|

| 2:32:53| Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Mr. Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Mr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Mr. Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9180)|

| 2:33:02| Mr. Talker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9184)|
| 2:33:04| Okay, so that motion passed unanimously, and I'm letting Commissioner Smith know to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9184)|
| 2:33:17| back to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| And we are on to agenda item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9201)|
| 2:33:35| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9215)|

| 2:34:34| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| Yes, Marnie Bailey is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9279)|
| 2:34:39| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| Ms. Bailey, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| This is Marnie Bailey, address 9629 Stone Canyon Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| The reason for my application is that I originally had a zone of C-4, and I'm just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9293)|
| 2:35:01| get back to my, get back closely to what C-4 allowed to have at that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| I'm a little surprised that there might be a denial because this property is flanked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| by Crow's Alignment and then also a, if we want to white van, the farmers that are fixing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9313)|
| 2:35:22| vans on the property right next door to me as well too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| So again, I am trying to get closer to a C-4 designation from what I had when, on December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9325)|
| 2:35:32| 31st, and it all changed on January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| I also want to just do a quick shout out to Liz Albertson and Mark Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9334)|
| 2:35:39| They were very instrumental in helping me work through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| This is my first time coming to the Planning Commission, and they did this all during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| So I really appreciate all the help that they provided as they were working from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| Awesome, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9350)|
