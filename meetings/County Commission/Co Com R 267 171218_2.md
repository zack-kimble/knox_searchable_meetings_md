| 4:01:09| on the capital plan for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| County? No, sir. It wouldn't jump ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| The other major projects that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14473)|
| 4:01:15| going to have underway would be, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| and the Ball Camp Extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| and both of those are funded and underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| so it wouldn't supersede any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14483)|
| 4:01:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14485)|
| 4:01:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14489)|
| 4:01:31| Dwight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| really start looking at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| areas about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| road extension and road expansion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| road development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| when the demand for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14503)|
| 4:01:45| and to live in that area starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| and it starts a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| you react to them very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| well, and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| nothing would happen out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| you're saying is right now you see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| and you're developing a road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| for the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| that area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| I don't know how you pronounce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| I'm out in Powell. We have three and four letter words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| out there. Emory Road. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14535)|
| 4:02:17| we're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| in situations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| expanding in all different areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14541)|
| 4:02:25| We don't build a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14545)|
| 4:02:27| to somewhere unless there's a demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| to be there, and since that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| demand's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| that's why you're putting this in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| correct? It is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| and if I could speak to that for just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14557)|
| 4:02:39| Mr. Chairman, what I wouldn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| this body to think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| that we aren't constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| considering what the long-range needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| of Knox County are. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14567)|
| 4:02:49| tell this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| in all candor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| that Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| particularly with the addition of the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14577)|
| 4:02:59| has experienced a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14579)|
| 4:03:01| pace of development that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| it'd be fair to say, has caught even us by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| surprise. I think I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| mentioned this body. I was speaking to a civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| group out at the Carnes Fire Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| some months back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| and when they asked me what kept me awake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| at night, I mentioned the Hardin Valley corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| West of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| Pellissippi Parkway, the pace of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| development out Hardin Valley and Hickory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14601)|
| 4:03:23| Creek is just breathtaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| We'll be back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14605)|
| 4:03:27| at some point in the not-too-distant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14607)|
| 4:03:29| future with capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14609)|
| 4:03:31| plans to address that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| But I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| want to recognize the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| the staff, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| Cindy, John Sexton, Aaron Fritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| they are constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14621)|
| 4:03:43| looking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14623)|
| 4:03:45| So I wouldn't want you to think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| is an area that we hadn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| considering, but the pace of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| and the amount of traffic that's in the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| area has been exponentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| increased, I think, probably by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| construction of the three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14639)|
| 4:04:03| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| I wanted to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14645)|
| 4:04:07| having a conversation with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14647)|
| 4:04:11| not the director of the East Region, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14653)|
| 4:04:15| right down from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| that they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| the gas tax has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14659)|
| 4:04:21| the reason some of this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14661)|
| 4:04:23| is moving forward is because the gas tax has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14663)|
| 4:04:25| moved some of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| and they're using safety money all the way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14667)|
| 4:04:29| Dutchtown Road to Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| in design and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| And part of that discussion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14673)|
| 4:04:35| you know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| Chair of HALO Extension has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| discussed since 2012 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14679)|
| 4:04:41| 2011, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| it's fast-tracked because TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| is adamant about closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| Carmichael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| and Schaefer off the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| of Schaefer on Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| Coward Mill. It wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14693)|
| 4:04:55| surprise me if George Light found another direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| I don't know that for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| but there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| conversation that's going on with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| and everybody else that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| wanting to close these little side streets that should have never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| connected to Pellissippi to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| My question would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14711)|
| 4:05:13| everybody in the room is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| about the traffic load on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14715)|
| 4:05:17| Coward Mill, and I drive Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| not as frequently as those that live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| Reagan Road, but some, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| on the traffic on Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| Dwight, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| or Jim, either one, if this were, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| it was approved and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| couldn't make them wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| the road was underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| or completed, where would their access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| be off of Coward Mill to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| access this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| on the design of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| Or anybody can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14743)|
| 4:05:47| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| I guess, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14749)|
| 4:05:51| rephrase, I guess, state the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14751)|
| 4:05:53| so I understand it correctly. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| absence of the road, where would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| their access be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14757)|
| 4:05:59| the development? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| If Coward Mill was not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| Cherry Island was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| what would their access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14767)|
| 4:06:09| look like? I think the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14769)|
| 4:06:11| access that they would be allowed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14771)|
| 4:06:13| state, I don't think the state would allow them to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14773)|
| 4:06:15| Pellissippi, so they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14775)|
| 4:06:17| to access Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| Yeah, Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14779)|
| 4:06:21| Coward Mill. Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| I'm sorry. Other side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14783)|
| 4:06:25| So they would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| access Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| Near the gas plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| Correct. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| Billy wanted to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| I guess, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14795)|
| 4:06:41| I'm Billy Fulgen with Fulgen-McIndoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| 10330 Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14803)|
| 4:06:45| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| So right now, the layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| that we have, if it's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| for the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| we'll have three access points. One would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| the future access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| to the Cherry Island extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| One would be to Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| and one would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| Faith Promise Church to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14823)|
| 4:07:05| access road that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| So we'd have three points of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| I have a figure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| Why would you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| Coward Mill and Cherry Halo? What benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| would you have for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14835)|
| 4:07:17| So if you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14837)|
| 4:07:19| Cherry Halo, why would you need a Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| access as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14841)|
| 4:07:27| He said future access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| Right. Well, I mean, but if you said that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| built the road, if we built the road, you'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14851)|
| 4:07:33| three access points, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14853)|
| 4:07:37| The Coward Mill would close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| once the extension was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| Name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| Rusty Vettel 10784 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| connection to Coward Mill would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| interim connection only. Once the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| extension was done, that road would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| be closed off. There would be no use for that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14873)|
| 4:07:57| We also have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| agreement, and we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| with the county engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| the adjacent property, which is Faith Promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| Church, that is basically designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| as a joint permanent easement, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14887)|
| 4:08:09| we would currently have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14889)|
| 4:08:11| go into Faith Promise Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| make a U-turn, and go into the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| and I've got some drawings here that show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| Yeah, I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14897)|
| 4:08:21| So, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| some discussion, myself and Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14903)|
| 4:08:27| about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14907)|
| 4:08:29| the timing of all this, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| Coward Mill really can't handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| a whole lot more traffic than what it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14913)|
| 4:08:37| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14917)|
| 4:08:47| yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14927)|
| 4:08:49| the drawing makes me struggle more, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14929)|
| 4:08:57| Faith Promise is to your left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14937)|
| 4:09:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14949)|
| 4:09:11| Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| Under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14953)|
| 4:09:15| proposal that you have at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| three-and-a-half per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| what is the traffic count addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| Coward Mill if there's no chair of HALO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14961)|
| 4:09:23| being built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| That's about a hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14965)|
| 4:09:27| Let me use a hundred homes. It's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14969)|
| 4:09:31| A hundred and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14971)|
| 4:09:35| A hundred and ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| something like that. Let's use a hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| I think the book says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| you get ten trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14981)|
| 4:09:43| per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14983)|
| 4:09:45| out of a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14985)|
| 4:09:47| That's an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14987)|
| 4:09:49| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| with the plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14991)|
| 4:09:53| Mr. Snowden and Mr. VanderVeet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14993)|
| 4:09:55| have discussed, it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| like the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14997)|
| 4:09:59| for this will tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| right into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| There's some image that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| if you all approve this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| suddenly homes will start being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| out there. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| incorrect. First, you would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15011)|
| 4:10:13| have a use-own-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15013)|
| 4:10:15| approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15015)|
| 4:10:17| And the earliest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15017)|
| 4:10:19| could be presented to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| is February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| and I doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15023)|
| 4:10:25| that's with the filing deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15025)|
| 4:10:27| Friday. So let's assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| the earliest that can go is in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15029)|
| 4:10:31| If that use-own-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| then the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15035)|
| 4:10:37| has to go to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15037)|
| 4:10:39| review stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15041)|
| 4:10:43| He lays out his roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15043)|
| 4:10:45| he shows his drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15045)|
| 4:10:47| facilities, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| That's a several-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15049)|
| 4:10:51| project. Then you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15051)|
| 4:10:53| build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15053)|
| 4:10:55| The roads would certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15055)|
| 4:10:57| not be in until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15057)|
| 4:10:59| probably late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15059)|
| 4:11:01| 18 or early 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15061)|
| 4:11:03| You can't build a hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15063)|
| 4:11:05| homes at one time. You basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15065)|
| 4:11:07| go through and build them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15067)|
| 4:11:09| one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15069)|
| 4:11:11| So, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15071)|
| 4:11:13| probably by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15073)|
| 4:11:15| the end of 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| or sometime in 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15077)|
| 4:11:19| you could start getting homes in there, but you aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15079)|
| 4:11:21| going to have this subdivision built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| until 21 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| 22, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| beyond Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15087)|
| 4:11:29| timeline here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15089)|
| 4:11:31| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15091)|

| 4:11:35| day per home, so you're at 1,000 trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| That's what the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| that's what the Uniform Traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| Manual says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| So, would Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15105)|
| 4:11:47| be approved by County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| for 1,000 trips a day, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| based on what you know now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| Do we have that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| We would have to do a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| certainly, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| would be looking at an entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| on Cherahola. There might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| a temporary entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| for construction traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| to Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| Does a hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| houses trigger a traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15135)|
| 4:12:17| I just don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| we could get through County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15139)|
| 4:12:21| at 1,000 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| I certainly don't think TDOT would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| Without the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| If this had the new road and we had it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| planned and functioned, there would be no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| to me, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| I'm questioning the timing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| discussion and the temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| entrance on Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| Because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| I mean, it depends on how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| time Mr. Biddle is willing to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| to build a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| because it could take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| looking at the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15173)|
| 4:12:55| that went around here, the best plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15175)|
| 4:12:57| for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| would eliminate several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| homes here on the Pellissippi side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| So, I mean, we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| Well, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15187)|
| 4:13:09| Knox County Engineering is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| exploring that. They've engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| an engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| That's the old Wilbur Smith firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| which has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| hundreds or thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| of highway projects around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| Have you seen the drawings? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| Mr. Biddle is willing to give up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15207)|
| 4:13:29| right-of-way for... He said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| he would give 30 feet of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| to Knox County. Did he say where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| Frontage Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| that's... We agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| with them that that won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| be good for 50 years. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15227)|
| 4:13:49| there ought to be a reasonable time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| if Knox County, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15231)|
| 4:13:53| doesn't do anything within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| three or four years, which it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| sound like they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| That offer is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| And we would be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| to make that part of any resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| There's some other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15249)|
| 4:14:11| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| Back a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| I asked Todd Napier, Development Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| if he had any opinion. He had no opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| one way or the other. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| weighed importantly on my decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| a forthcoming decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15267)|
| 4:14:29| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| question was asked, you know, I've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| look for a reason to do a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15273)|
| 4:14:35| plan change. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| introduction of new significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| new roads, utilities that were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| We are going to get a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| road. It may be two years before we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15285)|
| 4:14:47| a new road. That's a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| that the sector plan can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| Trends in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15291)|
| 4:14:53| is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15293)|
| 4:14:55| The trend there is not technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| That trend there is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15297)|
| 4:14:59| in Hardin Valley is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15303)|
| 4:15:05| Unless you're on Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| they run into some commercial off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| Hardin Valley, which we had previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| So, yeah, there are some reasons, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| that we could change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| You know, the concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| you know, I have e-mails that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| the opposition says they're satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| with three. They could live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| with three. Then you say 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| So we've got to have a happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| meeting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| A little happy meeting once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15329)|
| 4:15:31| you're a dead number, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15331)|
| 4:15:33| If you talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| about any builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15335)|
| 4:15:37| he wants a little leeway in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| because we don't have a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15339)|
| 4:15:41| up-to-date survey of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15341)|
| 4:15:43| We're saying we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15343)|
| 4:15:45| 3.5 to give them flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| I am not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| of any subdivisions involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| substantial number of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| that are built out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| exact density permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| The developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15357)|
| 4:15:59| here have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| we may end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| with 3.3 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| 3.4, but we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15365)|
| 4:16:07| that cushion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15367)|
| 4:16:09| to be able to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| and develop a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| 3.5 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15375)|
| 4:16:17| certainly a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| from what they had of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15379)|

| 4:16:25| And it's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| comparable with the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15389)|
| 4:16:31| in Hardin Valley and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15391)|
| 4:16:33| that area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| We are in the planned growth area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| We're not in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15397)|
| 4:16:39| residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| which is unusual because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| most of the ones on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15403)|

| 4:16:49| Are these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| I guess Mr. Biddle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| if he can answer, single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15413)|
| 4:16:55| dwelling units or are they going to be condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| Single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| homes, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15419)|
| 4:17:01| Well, 3.5 is 33 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| 34 acres. You're looking at 110| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15423)|
| 4:17:05| to 117 homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| That's if you max out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| If you max out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15429)|
| 4:17:11| And engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| you've got detention ponds and all that other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| I'm looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| yeah, the demand has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15439)|
| 4:17:21| Demand's not, and the TT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15441)|
| 4:17:23| help me out, CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15443)|
| 4:17:25| or that alphabet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15445)|
| 4:17:27| they approved it unanimously, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| And they had two lengthy hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15449)|
| 4:17:31| just like you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15451)|
| 4:17:33| on this issue, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| And the Development Corp has no opinion on one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| or the other that they can live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| We're going to have a road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| It's residential down there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| It's not technology. It's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15463)|
| 4:17:45| We're seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| you know where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| I appreciate Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| bringing up some of the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| and if I could have the spokesperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| from the homeowners associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15481)|
| 4:18:03| in the area, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15483)|
| 4:18:05| run something by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15485)|
| 4:18:09| I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| very apparent that everybody agrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| should be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| for residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| Correct, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| And the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| out there said two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| and the developer said 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| dwelling units per acre, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| at 3.5, that's 118| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| homes. You guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15511)|
| 4:18:33| looking at 68 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| If it's two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| per acre, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| okay? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| And as Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| said, most of the projects that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| approve, the magic number is three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| units an acre. So at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| three units, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| 101 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15531)|
| 4:18:53| So if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15533)|
| 4:18:55| reading Mr. Daley's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15535)|
| 4:18:57| if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15537)|
| 4:18:59| commission agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| to have 100 home sites on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| property, is that something that you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15543)|
| 4:19:05| could live with? And if you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| to take a minute to talk to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| people, that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| help to move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15551)|
| 4:19:13| All the established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15553)|
| 4:19:15| subdivisions are around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| 2.5. Is that built out, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| is that zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15559)|
| 4:19:21| Built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15561)|
| 4:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| Because I think they're zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| Hannah Fields is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15567)|
| 4:19:29| three, Reagan Landing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15569)|
| 4:19:31| 3.5, and Magnolia Point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| is three. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15573)|
| 4:19:35| build-out you're saying is closer to 2.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| Magnolia Point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| closer to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15579)|
| 4:19:41| Dan, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| know the actual zoning? But my point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15583)|
| 4:19:45| I think you need to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15585)|
| 4:19:47| the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15587)|
| 4:19:49| and we can hold on for a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15589)|
| 4:19:51| or so if you want to ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| what their opinion is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15593)|
| 4:19:55| set your foot in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| Okay. And the other one thing I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15597)|
| 4:19:59| though, is are we talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15599)|
| 4:20:01| about the road being developed first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| No. We're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| that this gentleman can go for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| with a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| of 100 homes on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15609)|
| 4:20:11| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15611)|
| 4:20:13| I'm not speaking for the other nine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| I'm just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| would you consider that? I'm throwing that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| because we're not getting anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| Because the road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| long ways off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15625)|
| 4:20:27| Hi. Joyce McGee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15627)|
| 4:20:29| 10457 Laurel Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15629)|
| 4:20:31| My question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15631)|
| 4:20:33| is we keep talking about future expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15633)|
| 4:20:35| of the road, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15635)|
| 4:20:37| Mr. Biddle and the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15637)|
| 4:20:39| or the property owners are willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15639)|
| 4:20:41| how much land they're willing to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| for an access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| I'm not opposed to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15645)|
| 4:20:47| There's my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| I'm not opposed to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15649)|
| 4:20:51| I'm opposed to high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| and medium density. I like the smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15653)|
| 4:20:55| amount per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| My question is if immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15657)|
| 4:20:59| this is changed, the zoning is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15659)|
| 4:21:01| it's going low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15661)|
| 4:21:03| three properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| they immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| go into the development stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| and the planning stage before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15669)|

| 4:21:15| If they plan it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15675)|
| 4:21:17| and they start building it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15677)|
| 4:21:19| before we plan for the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15679)|
| 4:21:21| and before a decision is made with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15681)|
| 4:21:23| Knox County which direction the road's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15683)|
| 4:21:25| there's no guarantee the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15685)|
| 4:21:27| is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15689)|
| 4:21:31| There's no guarantee that the land will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15691)|
| 4:21:33| there for the right-of-way road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15693)|
| 4:21:35| We can stipulate in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15695)|
| 4:21:37| I believe, and correct me, Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| if I'm wrong, we can stipulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15699)|
| 4:21:41| in the motion that the right-of-way must be given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15701)|
| 4:21:43| the 30-foot right-of-way must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15703)|
| 4:21:45| given to the county in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15705)|
| 4:21:47| I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15707)|
| 4:21:49| agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15709)|
| 4:21:51| Is that a stipulation we can add legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| Okay. So we can add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15713)|
| 4:21:55| that in there for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15715)|
| 4:21:57| We can say there's 30 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15717)|
| 4:21:59| for 10 years and then after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15719)|
| 4:22:01| 10 years if the county don't move their feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| then he can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| his 30 feet back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15725)|
| 4:22:07| I think, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15727)|
| 4:22:09| I'll tell you right now, I've tried to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15729)|
| 4:22:11| Cherry Hill Extension since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15731)|
| 4:22:13| There's no question I'll vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15733)|
| 4:22:15| I think the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| that I've gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15737)|
| 4:22:19| from tonight, and TDOT's going to be a partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15739)|
| 4:22:21| in this because they want Coward Mill closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| That can be stipulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15745)|
| 4:22:27| in the motion that the 30-feet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15747)|
| 4:22:29| to be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15749)|
| 4:22:31| They have to agree, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| I wouldn't take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15753)|
| 4:22:35| without making that a stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15755)|
| 4:22:37| but they have to agree to that. I think they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15757)|
| 4:22:39| so far. If that answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15759)|
| 4:22:41| your question. It does. I guess Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15761)|
| 4:22:43| Snowden would say, is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| Is 30 feet enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| Yeah, it's a 22 or 24-foot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| The state has quite a bit of right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15769)|
| 4:22:51| They may be able to use TDOT right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15771)|
| 4:22:53| Right, as well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15773)|
| 4:22:55| We've got to work that out with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15775)|
| 4:22:57| The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15777)|
| 4:22:59| ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15779)|
| 4:23:01| She's talking. I don't want to hurt her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15781)|
| 4:23:03| The other stipulation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15783)|
| 4:23:05| you talk about them, okay, if they get a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| I don't think the county is going to let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| have a plan if they know there are roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15789)|
| 4:23:11| I think that's going to be a mutual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| timing discussion. I don't think the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15793)|
| 4:23:15| going to say, we're going to not build this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15795)|
| 4:23:17| so you can go ahead and do that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15797)|
| 4:23:19| some discussion to be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15799)|
| 4:23:21| Can I ask, how does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15801)|
| 4:23:23| impact the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15803)|
| 4:23:25| parcel of land that's 30 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15805)|
| 4:23:27| in between Reagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15807)|
| 4:23:29| Road and Coward Mill that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15809)|
| 4:23:31| wants to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| 3 to 5 acres of land on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15813)|
| 4:23:35| And I know that's the future, but how could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| you tell them no? Which property are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| Well, it's not anything in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15819)|
| 4:23:41| There's a lot of land there. There's not 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| The county owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| everything over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15825)|
| 4:23:47| the right side. The county owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15827)|
| 4:23:49| everything over to Hardin Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15829)|
| 4:23:51| and Wild Fern, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15831)|
| 4:23:53| Reagan's Landing, maybe, or Reagan Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| The county already owns that for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| The county is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15839)|
| 4:24:01| going to give up. And part of the problem that they can't sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| this is the county can offer this land cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| than what they can sell their land for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| It handicaps them a little bit. And I do. I know it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| like we're not sympathizing. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| sympathize. If I own the land, would I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15851)|
| 4:24:13| sell it? Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| I actually think the community discussion has been really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15855)|
| 4:24:17| I don't think there's any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| Everybody has a vested interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15859)|
| 4:24:21| It's been a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15861)|
| 4:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15863)|
| 4:24:25| Could I add one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| A previous speaker talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15869)|
| 4:24:31| In Knox County and, likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15871)|
| 4:24:33| in the city of Knoxville, low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15873)|
| 4:24:35| is, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| let's see, Knox County is five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15877)|
| 4:24:39| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| I gave away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| our bottom line, 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| units per acre. Perhaps I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| would have been a better negotiator if I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| come here tonight and said we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| four or five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| and then let you back me down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15893)|
| 4:24:55| 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15895)|
| 4:24:57| 3.5 is really what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15897)|
| 4:24:59| we need. Now, we are going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15899)|
| 4:25:01| to build it out to 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15901)|
| 4:25:03| but you need that cushion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15903)|
| 4:25:05| because you've got road dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15907)|
| 4:25:09| And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| basically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| I think, Dan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15913)|
| 4:25:15| what can you get on the RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15915)|
| 4:25:17| property? About three...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| Minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15921)|
| 4:25:23| Theoretically, you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15923)|
| 4:25:25| over three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| on RA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15927)|
| 4:25:31| So that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| I would have done a better job if I'd come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| in here and said four, four and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15935)|
| 4:25:37| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15937)|
| 4:25:39| Charge them less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| Bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15941)|
| 4:25:43| Charge them less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15943)|
| 4:25:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15945)|
| 4:25:47| I've been filibustered here by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| At some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| point in time, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15953)|

| 4:25:59| about a capitalistic society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| at some point when you get the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15961)|

| 4:26:15| expensive property. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15975)|
| 4:26:17| is you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| below 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| you're getting in the area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15981)|
| 4:26:23| just killing the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15983)|

| 4:26:27| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15987)|
| 4:26:29| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15989)|
| 4:26:31| that's what we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15991)|
| 4:26:33| I mean, you know, I guess you go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15993)|
| 4:26:35| 3.25 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15995)|
| 4:26:37| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15997)|
| 4:26:39| I'm pretty sure that once you get below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=15999)|
| 4:26:41| 3.5, you're starting to get into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16001)|

| 4:26:45| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16005)|

| 4:26:55| if Chair Holland didn't go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| and they gave approval for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16017)|
| 4:26:59| subdivision, where would the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16019)|
| 4:27:01| come out onto Coward Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16021)|
| 4:27:03| There's only one place that I could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| It's a 90 degree angle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16025)|

| 4:27:11| If there's accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16031)|
| 4:27:13| now and there's no road coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16033)|
| 4:27:15| out, where would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| this road come out? There's only one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| because of the propane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16039)|

| 4:27:23| answered that. Could we have an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16043)|
| 4:27:25| to where that road comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| if Chair Holland is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16047)|

| 4:27:35| anticipate changing anybody's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16055)|
| 4:27:37| here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| a little bit of a history lesson in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16059)|
| 4:27:41| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16061)|

| 4:27:51| and that was done after a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| extensive planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| effort that was done in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16077)|
| 4:27:59| the decision, looking back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16079)|
| 4:28:01| you know, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| broad idea. The idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16083)|
| 4:28:05| was you've got Oak Ridge to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16085)|

| 4:28:11| take advantage of the brainpower that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16091)|
| 4:28:13| in Oak Ridge, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| the idea of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| Technology Park came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16097)|
| 4:28:19| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16099)|
| 4:28:21| The property got rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| The county commission at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16105)|
| 4:28:27| it wasn't done in the dark. The county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| commission at that time is the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| rezoned that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16111)|
| 4:28:33| to BPTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| There was a decision made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16115)|
| 4:28:37| the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16117)|
| 4:28:39| at that time that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16119)|
| 4:28:41| BPTO Technology Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| idea was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16123)|
| 4:28:45| idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16125)|
| 4:28:47| Since that time, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16127)|
| 4:28:49| I will reiterate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| the sector plan was re-adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16131)|
| 4:28:53| this past, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16133)|
| 4:28:55| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16135)|
| 4:28:57| I think if there is a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16137)|
| 4:28:59| to move away from the Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16139)|
| 4:29:01| Park idea, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16141)|
| 4:29:03| we ought to look at it in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| way that we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16145)|
| 4:29:07| the area when the Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16147)|
| 4:29:09| Park was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16149)|
| 4:29:11| We need to look at it on a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16151)|
| 4:29:13| broader scale than looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16153)|
| 4:29:15| at one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| because what could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16157)|
| 4:29:19| happen is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| I've said it earlier, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| I probably glossed over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16163)|
| 4:29:25| changing to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| zoning for property fronting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16167)|
| 4:29:29| Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16169)|
| 4:29:31| At that point, I think that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16171)|
| 4:29:33| significant precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| that the commission is going to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16175)|
| 4:29:37| I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16177)|
| 4:29:39| that if the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16179)|
| 4:29:41| is getting ready to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| money in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16183)|
| 4:29:45| they would get a much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16185)|
| 4:29:47| return for their dollar if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16187)|
| 4:29:49| was a successful business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16189)|
| 4:29:51| park as opposed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| subdivision out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16193)|
| 4:29:55| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| it was said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16197)|
| 4:30:01| about concern about the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16201)|
| 4:30:03| on Coward Mill. The traffic on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| Coward Mill is not the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16205)|
| 4:30:07| The concern is the traffic on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16207)|
| 4:30:09| Pellissippi Parkway. It operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16209)|
| 4:30:11| as an interstate highway. It's carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| interstate levels of traffic right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16213)|
| 4:30:15| and unless the improvements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16215)|
| 4:30:17| in place when this subdivision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16217)|
| 4:30:19| developed, you're going to have a thousand people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16219)|
| 4:30:21| that are either going to come out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16221)|
| 4:30:23| this end and try to get out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16223)|
| 4:30:25| the parkway. Hopefully, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16225)|
| 4:30:27| they'll be turning right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| Can you imagine trying to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16229)|
| 4:30:31| left on I-40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16231)|
| 4:30:33| Trying to come out and turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16233)|
| 4:30:35| left across I-40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16235)|
| 4:30:37| Well, that's about what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16237)|
| 4:30:39| These people, if they develop a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| in there, that they would be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| say, here's your access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16243)|
| 4:30:45| If you want to go to town, you turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16245)|
| 4:30:47| So, from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16247)|
| 4:30:49| I think the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16249)|
| 4:30:53| that you're making tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| you need to realize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16255)|
| 4:30:57| potential impact that it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16257)|
| 4:30:59| on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16259)|
| 4:31:01| Local Motors, some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16261)|
| 4:31:03| other businesses that have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16263)|
| 4:31:05| out there, there have been hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16265)|
| 4:31:07| of thousands of square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16267)|
| 4:31:09| developed in the BP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16269)|
| 4:31:11| It's not an abject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16271)|
| 4:31:13| failure. There has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16273)|
| 4:31:15| been a lot of development that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16275)|
| 4:31:17| occurred out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16277)|
| 4:31:19| Granted, it is slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| and I think Mr. Fain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| Kemp Fain, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16283)|
| 4:31:25| last time this thing came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16285)|
| 4:31:27| said that they've had people look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| the property for BP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16289)|
| 4:31:31| commercial-type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16291)|
| 4:31:33| The problem is their access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Well, the county's getting ready to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| them potentially access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16297)|
| 4:31:39| so it would appear that he may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| have a very attractive piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16301)|
| 4:31:43| sitting there once the access is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| Again, it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16307)|
| 4:31:51| planning is trying to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16311)|
| 4:31:53| markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16313)|
| 4:31:55| That property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16315)|
| 4:31:57| has sat there a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| and there has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| plenty of other property that fronts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16321)|
| 4:32:03| Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16323)|
| 4:32:05| and the technology overlay that's been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16325)|
| 4:32:07| for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16327)|
| 4:32:09| What is so special about this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| one? It's the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16331)|
| 4:32:13| I don't think you'll find frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| property that's been used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16335)|
| 4:32:17| The properties that have been zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16337)|
| 4:32:19| away from that are back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16339)|
| 4:32:21| The Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16341)|
| 4:32:23| when it was first developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16343)|
| 4:32:25| it was probably four miles wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| and it's been narrowed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16347)|
| 4:32:29| considerably ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| But the frontage, if the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| to Calor Mills cut off, what good is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| the frontage other than exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16355)|
| 4:32:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| What I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16361)|
| 4:32:43| if there's going to be an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16363)|
| 4:32:45| made by the county or the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| or whoever's going to make that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| improved access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| the return would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| better if it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| developed for a BP use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| as opposed to a detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| single-family residential subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16381)|
| 4:33:03| My guess is the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16383)|
| 4:33:06| I'm not going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16386)|
| 4:33:08| I just feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16388)|
| 4:33:10| retailing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16390)|
| 4:33:12| along the frontage of the Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16392)|
| 4:33:14| to residential use needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16394)|
| 4:33:16| to be looked at in the context of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16396)|
| 4:33:18| entire Parkway as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16398)|
| 4:33:20| one individual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16400)|
| 4:33:24| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16404)|
| 4:33:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16406)|
| 4:33:28| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16408)|
| 4:33:31| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16411)|
| 4:33:33| The question was asked about Calor Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16413)|
| 4:33:35| If it was not widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16415)|
| 4:33:37| the traffic would not hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16417)|
| 4:33:39| 1,000 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16419)|
| 4:33:41| So I don't think, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16421)|
| 4:33:43| would it be approved for 1,000 trips a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16423)|
| 4:33:45| if it's not improved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16425)|
| 4:33:49| I don't think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16429)|
| 4:33:51| As I was sitting here thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16431)|
| 4:33:53| about that exact question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16433)|
| 4:33:55| I was trying to think of a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16435)|
| 4:33:57| that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16437)|
| 4:34:00| appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16440)|
| 4:34:02| And I'm not sure if I know that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16442)|
| 4:34:04| But it is definitely less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16444)|
| 4:34:06| 1,000 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16446)|
| 4:34:08| That's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16448)|
| 4:34:10| from an engineering and operational standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16450)|
| 4:34:12| we would not want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16452)|
| 4:34:14| we wouldn't prefer to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16454)|
| 4:34:16| I hope that answers your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16456)|
| 4:34:18| a little bit as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16458)|
| 4:34:20| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16460)|
| 4:34:22| and when the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16462)|
| 4:34:24| I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16464)|
| 4:34:26| Commissioner Bussler over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16466)|
| 4:34:29| if the road is not extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16469)|
| 4:34:31| Calor Mill Road will not hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16471)|
| 4:34:33| that 118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16473)|
| 4:34:35| So it won't be 118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16475)|
| 4:34:37| It may be 60 or 70 or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16477)|
| 4:34:39| the traffic count may come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16479)|
| 4:34:41| I guess, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16481)|
| 4:34:43| can we stipulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16483)|
| 4:34:45| that any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16485)|
| 4:34:47| construction be started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16489)|
| 4:34:51| road is extended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16491)|
| 4:34:53| Or is that beyond what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16493)|
| 4:34:55| Or improve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16495)|
| 4:34:58| I have never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16498)|
| 4:35:00| that condition imposed on a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16500)|
| 4:35:02| However, the body does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16502)|
| 4:35:04| authority to impose conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16504)|
| 4:35:06| unilateral conditions on rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16506)|
| 4:35:08| But I am not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16508)|
| 4:35:10| of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16510)|
| 4:35:12| condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16512)|
| 4:35:14| that has been posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16514)|
| 4:35:16| like that ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16516)|
| 4:35:18| So you'd be breaking new ground in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16518)|
| 4:35:20| But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16520)|
| 4:35:22| also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16522)|
| 4:35:24| potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16524)|
| 4:35:26| given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16526)|
| 4:35:28| engineering's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16528)|
| 4:35:30| testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16530)|
| 4:35:32| So we're putting the cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16532)|
| 4:35:34| as far as the conditions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16534)|
| 4:35:36| requirements of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16536)|
| 4:35:38| that utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16538)|
| 4:35:40| and roads and things be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16540)|
| 4:35:42| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16542)|
| 4:35:44| The zoning when it's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16544)|
| 4:35:46| is if you approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16546)|
| 4:35:48| at 3.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16548)|
| 4:35:50| that's up to 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16550)|
| 4:35:52| And through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16552)|

| 4:35:58| the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16558)|
| 4:36:00| if they can determine somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16560)|
| 4:36:02| that the impact is too great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16562)|
| 4:36:04| at 3.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16564)|
| 4:36:06| they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16566)|
| 4:36:08| approve something with fewer units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16568)|

| 4:36:12| if that's what you have in mind or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16572)|
| 4:36:14| or I don't know if Mr. Seymour's clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16574)|
| 4:36:16| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16576)|
| 4:36:18| if they showed up and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16578)|
| 4:36:20| we want 118 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16580)|
| 4:36:22| it hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16582)|
| 4:36:24| historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16584)|
| 4:36:26| reduced densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16586)|

| 4:36:30| of the roads. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16590)|
| 4:36:32| situations where we've had people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16592)|
| 4:36:34| to improve sections of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16594)|
| 4:36:36| but really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16596)|
| 4:36:38| subdivisions have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16598)|

| 4:36:42| the road is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16602)|
| 4:36:44| well, unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16604)|
| 4:36:46| they're excessively narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16606)|

| 4:36:54| excessively narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16614)|
| 4:36:56| given how close it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16616)|
| 4:36:58| to the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16618)|
| 4:37:00| So, it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16620)|
| 4:37:02| be an issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16622)|
| 4:37:04| if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16624)|
| 4:37:06| you know, if this commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16626)|
| 4:37:08| sitting here going, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16628)|
| 4:37:10| you all need to look at that and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16630)|
| 4:37:12| the road isn't there, then you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16632)|
| 4:37:14| consider approving less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16634)|
| 4:37:16| If that's your charge, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16636)|
| 4:37:18| I'll be glad to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16638)|
| 4:37:20| and run with it, but most of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16640)|
| 4:37:22| when these things are approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16642)|
| 4:37:24| at these kind of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16644)|
| 4:37:26| you kind of, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16646)|
| 4:37:28| the elected officials for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16648)|
| 4:37:30| you kind of expect the development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16650)|
| 4:37:32| occur in line with what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16652)|
| 4:37:34| approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16654)|
| 4:37:36| We have had subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16656)|
| 4:37:38| and I think Mr. Snowden and I were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16658)|
| 4:37:40| discussing one three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16660)|
| 4:37:42| months ago, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16662)|
| 4:37:44| a condition has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16664)|
| 4:37:46| requested and put on it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16666)|
| 4:37:48| county engineering that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16668)|
| 4:37:50| no, only a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16670)|
| 4:37:52| of lots could be platted at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16672)|
| 4:37:54| a certain time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16674)|
| 4:37:56| until the road was completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16676)|
| 4:37:58| was this Ball Camp or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16678)|
| 4:38:00| Ball Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16680)|
| 4:38:02| Shod Road. Yeah, the Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16682)|
| 4:38:04| extension that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16684)|
| 4:38:06| the, although the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16686)|
| 4:38:08| plan approved a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16688)|
| 4:38:10| of lots, lots could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16690)|
| 4:38:12| be platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16692)|
| 4:38:14| until there was a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16694)|
| 4:38:16| of completion of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16696)|
| 4:38:18| And you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16698)|
| 4:38:20| offer lots for sale in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16700)|
| 4:38:22| until they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| have been platted. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16704)|
| 4:38:26| that effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16706)|
| 4:38:28| allowed a segment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16708)|
| 4:38:30| the subdivision to go forward, but most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16710)|
| 4:38:32| of it had to wait, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16712)|
| 4:38:34| that'll be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16714)|
| 4:38:36| this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16716)|
| 4:38:38| One day when you all finish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16718)|
| 4:38:41| Is that something you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| willing to agree to, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16723)|
| 4:38:45| Well, that was put on by county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16725)|
| 4:38:47| really, and if that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16727)|
| 4:38:49| situation, we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16729)|
| 4:38:51| to go ahead after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16731)|
| 4:38:53| the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16733)|
| 4:38:55| and county engineering approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| to start building the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16737)|
| 4:38:59| and start doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16739)|
| 4:39:01| detention ponds and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16741)|
| 4:39:03| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16743)|
| 4:39:05| What county engineering did in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16745)|
| 4:39:07| we were just talking about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16747)|
| 4:39:09| they said you cannot plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16749)|
| 4:39:11| a certain number of lots, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16751)|
| 4:39:13| was at the use on review stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16753)|
| 4:39:15| until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| road is finished. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| think that would be the best way to handle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16759)|
| 4:39:21| let the county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16761)|
| 4:39:23| department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| MPC work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16765)|
| 4:39:27| Mr. Snowden, do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16767)|
| 4:39:33| Mr. Wyandavate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16773)|

| 4:39:38| Well, I don't want to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16778)|
| 4:39:40| confusing discussion any more confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16780)|
| 4:39:42| but just as a follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16784)|
| 4:39:46| the record, this isn't to stipulate a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16786)|
| 4:39:48| but just to give this body some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| A traffic impact study is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16790)|
| 4:39:52| for any residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16792)|
| 4:39:54| at 75 lots or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16794)|
| 4:39:56| The applicant has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16796)|
| 4:39:58| provide a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16798)|
| 4:40:00| impact study completed by an engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16800)|
| 4:40:02| of record that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16802)|
| 4:40:04| provides projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16804)|
| 4:40:06| for trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16806)|
| 4:40:08| generation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16808)|
| 4:40:10| it has to be based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16810)|
| 4:40:12| conditions that exist at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16812)|
| 4:40:14| that that application is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16814)|
| 4:40:16| So, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16816)|
| 4:40:20| this is a complicated landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16820)|
| 4:40:22| because we have a road that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16822)|
| 4:40:24| theoretically be under construction, assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16824)|
| 4:40:26| this body approves the budget and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16826)|
| 4:40:28| move forward, but the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16828)|
| 4:40:30| impact study, and clearly a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16830)|
| 4:40:32| of this size is going to be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16832)|
| 4:40:34| to have one, is going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16834)|
| 4:40:36| have an engineer of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16836)|
| 4:40:38| that has stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16838)|
| 4:40:40| under seal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16840)|
| 4:40:42| facilities as they exist will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16842)|
| 4:40:44| accommodate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16844)|

| 4:40:50| In response to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16850)|

| 4:40:56| for lack of a better word, there is precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16856)|
| 4:40:58| for that. Another example that Cindy and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16858)|

| 4:41:12| when the applicant and the owner of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16872)|

| 4:41:24| that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16884)|

| 4:41:42| but that is later in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16902)|

| 4:41:46| that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16906)|
| 4:41:48| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16908)|
| 4:41:50| complicated discussion, but we aren't going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16910)|

| 4:42:02| I don't think anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16922)|
| 4:42:04| up here...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| I was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16926)|
| 4:42:08| to make sure we found a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16928)|
| 4:42:10| that these neighbors were not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16930)|
| 4:42:12| 1,000 trips a day before that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16932)|
| 4:42:14| was finished, and we have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16934)|
| 4:42:16| and that's the answer, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16936)|

| 4:42:24| I am familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16944)|

| 4:42:30| closing this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| onto Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16952)|
| 4:42:34| would the State be open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16954)|
| 4:42:36| cost-sharing with us if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16956)|
| 4:42:38| were going forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16958)|
| 4:42:40| Cherahala extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16960)|
| 4:42:42| I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16962)|
| 4:42:44| couldn't speak for the State in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16964)|
| 4:42:46| I will say that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16966)|
| 4:42:48| that the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16968)|
| 4:42:50| is our single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16970)|
| 4:42:52| important partner in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16972)|
| 4:42:54| kinds of projects. Also, a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16974)|
| 4:42:56| will recall that in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16976)|
| 4:42:58| year's budget that was approved, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16978)|
| 4:43:00| actually included a line item. It's either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16980)|
| 4:43:02| a million or a million and a half dollars. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16982)|
| 4:43:04| labeled TDOT partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16984)|
| 4:43:06| and those are funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16986)|
| 4:43:08| we use more often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16988)|
| 4:43:10| than not. We actually assist TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16990)|
| 4:43:12| but TDOT has certainly assisted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16992)|
| 4:43:14| I couldn't offer any assurance, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16994)|
| 4:43:16| I would say that they are our primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16996)|
| 4:43:18| professional partner in all matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=16998)|
| 4:43:20| transportation-related. Because I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17000)|
| 4:43:22| I heard something along that line, going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17002)|
| 4:43:24| several hours in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17004)|
| 4:43:26| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17006)|
| 4:43:28| they may be interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17008)|
| 4:43:30| their redesign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17010)|
| 4:43:32| of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17012)|
| 4:43:34| interchange, Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17014)|
| 4:43:36| and Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17016)|
| 4:43:38| that some of these entrances and exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17018)|
| 4:43:40| they may try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17020)|
| 4:43:42| rid of. And this is one that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17022)|
| 4:43:44| would offer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17024)|
| 4:43:46| an easy out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17026)|
| 4:43:48| They ought to help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17028)|
| 4:43:50| I certainly think they intend to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17030)|
| 4:43:52| If you would look, if commission would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17032)|
| 4:43:54| the Alcoa Highway improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17034)|
| 4:43:56| as an example of what TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| is intending to do, similarly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17038)|
| 4:44:00| you've got a high-speed four-lane facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17040)|
| 4:44:02| where you had at-grade intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17042)|
| 4:44:04| and the state is attempting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17044)|
| 4:44:06| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17046)|
| 4:44:08| retool the facility such that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17048)|
| 4:44:10| have no more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17050)|
| 4:44:12| left-turn opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17052)|
| 4:44:14| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17054)|
| 4:44:16| you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17056)|
| 4:44:18| essentially on-ramps and off-ramps and safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17058)|
| 4:44:20| conditions for the speeds that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17060)|
| 4:44:22| And that's certainly their intention long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17062)|
| 4:44:24| with Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17064)|
| 4:44:30| I had a question for you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17070)|
| 4:44:34| There are three subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17074)|
| 4:44:36| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17076)|
| 4:44:38| Two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17078)|
| 4:44:40| are off Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17080)|
| 4:44:42| Reagan Landing, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17082)|
| 4:44:44| you saw the Hardin Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17084)|
| 4:44:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17086)|
| 4:44:48| And then if you go to the end of Reagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17088)|
| 4:44:50| and make a right, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17090)|
| 4:44:52| Magnolia Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17092)|
| 4:44:54| This subdivision would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17094)|
| 4:44:56| to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17096)|
| 4:44:58| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17098)|
| 4:45:00| How do most of you guys travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17100)|
| 4:45:02| Do you all go down Reagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17102)|
| 4:45:04| to Pellissippi, or are you coming up Reagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17104)|
| 4:45:06| to Coward Mill and then over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17106)|
| 4:45:08| Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17108)|
| 4:45:10| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17110)|

| 4:45:22| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17122)|
| 4:45:24| we live between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17124)|
| 4:45:26| Reagan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17126)|
| 4:45:28| and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17128)|
| 4:45:30| You're that subdivision that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17130)|
| 4:45:32| a larger track subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17132)|
| 4:45:34| correct, or you live on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17134)|
| 4:45:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17136)|
| 4:45:38| I wanted to explain something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17138)|
| 4:45:40| and then I'll come back to your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17140)|
| 4:45:42| if you don't mind. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17142)|
| 4:45:44| He said something about that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17144)|
| 4:45:46| couldn't make any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17146)|

| 4:46:16| And we went to them, and we asked them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17176)|
| 4:46:18| if we could buy from the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17178)|

| 4:46:26| developing it, but we couldn't stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17186)|
| 4:46:28| that much because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17188)|

| 4:46:48| from Reagan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17208)|

| 4:46:52| there's at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17212)|
| 4:46:54| one to two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17214)|

| 4:47:06| Now they're saying three and a half per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17226)|
| 4:47:08| Even three and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17228)|
| 4:47:10| is setting a new precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17230)|
| 4:47:12| What's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17232)|
| 4:47:14| Sure, you'll have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17234)|
| 4:47:16| You'll have, if you get Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17236)|

| 4:47:20| Yeah. That'll help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17240)|
| 4:47:22| some people on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17242)|
| 4:47:24| But as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17244)|
| 4:47:26| all the other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17246)|
| 4:47:28| that are on there, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17248)|
| 4:47:30| giving them potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17250)|
| 4:47:32| for having another bottleneck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17252)|
| 4:47:34| going down the road for all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17254)|
| 4:47:36| other properties that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17256)|
| 4:47:38| come up for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17258)|
| 4:47:40| because there's acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17260)|
| 4:47:42| there. Okay, you're setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17262)|
| 4:47:44| a precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17264)|
| 4:47:46| Let's keep the precedence low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17266)|
| 4:47:48| until we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17268)|
| 4:47:50| some infrastructure in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17270)|
| 4:47:52| where we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17272)|
| 4:47:54| a way to maneuver around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17274)|
| 4:47:56| People bought land out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17276)|
| 4:47:58| to enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17278)|
| 4:48:00| their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17280)|
| 4:48:02| and not be a misery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17282)|
| 4:48:04| to them and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17284)|
| 4:48:06| live out their life there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17286)|
| 4:48:08| They have put a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17288)|
| 4:48:10| and a lot of money into their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17290)|
| 4:48:12| And if we could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17292)|
| 4:48:14| and we developed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17294)|
| 4:48:16| subdivision and we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17296)|
| 4:48:18| some money too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17298)|
| 4:48:20| and we didn't take off into the sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17300)|
| 4:48:24| we stayed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17304)|
| 4:48:26| and have made a beautiful community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17306)|
| 4:48:28| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17308)|
| 4:48:30| And that's all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17310)|
| 4:48:32| If they want to develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17312)|
| 4:48:34| that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17314)|
| 4:48:36| But let's don't go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17316)|
| 4:48:38| 3 per acre. Let's don't go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17318)|
| 4:48:40| 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17320)|
| 4:48:42| Let's give us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17322)|
| 4:48:44| chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| If they build houses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| the school's Karn's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17328)|

| 4:48:52| they're going to have to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17332)|
| 4:48:54| They're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17334)|

| 4:50:44| turning onto Coward Mill to get to Karis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17444)|
| 4:50:46| That's what happened this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17446)|
| 4:50:48| Lots of cars come up Reagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17448)|
| 4:50:50| turn left, and go to Karis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17450)|
| 4:50:52| So there's a lot of cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17452)|
| 4:50:54| that go down Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17454)|
| 4:50:58| Where does Karis go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17458)|
| 4:51:00| Karis is the health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17460)|
| 4:51:02| Right there. So I think people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17462)|
| 4:51:04| that they don't want to get on Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17464)|
| 4:51:06| and then turn off Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17466)|
| 4:51:08| to go into Karis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17468)|
| 4:51:10| now they come up Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17470)|
| 4:51:12| But most of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17472)|
| 4:51:14| from your divisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17474)|
| 4:51:16| go back to Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17476)|
| 4:51:18| I would say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17478)|
| 4:51:20| Back to Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17480)|
| 4:51:28| I would say a lot of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17488)|
| 4:51:30| goes to Coward Mill and goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17490)|
| 4:51:32| Pellissippi, depending on the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17492)|
| 4:51:40| I travel to work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17500)|
| 4:51:42| I've lived in the area. I've lived in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17502)|
| 4:51:44| Millia Point for almost 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17504)|
| 4:51:46| I think now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| I worked off Cedar Bluff for most of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17508)|
| 4:51:50| I would go because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17510)|
| 4:51:52| the traffic in the morning, if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17512)|
| 4:51:54| Reagan Road, it backs up from the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17514)|
| 4:51:56| developments, turning onto Middlebrook Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17516)|
| 4:51:58| and sometimes the Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17518)|
| 4:52:00| College, because you've got King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17520)|
| 4:52:02| you have Pellissippi, the several colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17522)|
| 4:52:04| and the school traffic, that backs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17524)|
| 4:52:06| So I would go down Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17526)|
| 4:52:08| Sometimes you're 10 and 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17528)|
| 4:52:10| waiting to turn left onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17530)|
| 4:52:12| Pellissippi Parkway, and kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17532)|
| 4:52:14| from, especially during the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17534)|
| 4:52:16| year, Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17536)|
| 4:52:18| they're coming down to Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17538)|
| 4:52:20| and they're doing a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17540)|
| 4:52:22| So you've got people turning right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17542)|
| 4:52:24| on Pellissippi Parkway, you've got people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17544)|
| 4:52:26| turning left off Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17546)|
| 4:52:28| onto Pellissippi Parkway, and you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17548)|
| 4:52:30| a line of cars on Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17550)|
| 4:52:32| trying to do a U-turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17552)|
| 4:52:34| at Coward Mill to get off to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17554)|
| 4:52:36| to Pellissippi State in time for school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17556)|
| 4:52:38| So we're compounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17558)|
| 4:52:40| that issue, but just to give you a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17560)|
| 4:52:42| perspective, because I do travel to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17562)|
| 4:52:44| every day. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17566)|
| 4:52:48| the road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17568)|
| 4:52:50| does go in, and Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17570)|
| 4:52:52| is close to Pellissippi, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17572)|
| 4:52:54| kind of reverse patterns on traffic there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17574)|
| 4:52:56| wouldn't it? What I think would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17576)|
| 4:52:58| is U-turns are going to have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17578)|
| 4:53:00| illegal on Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17580)|
| 4:53:02| The whole off-ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17582)|
| 4:53:04| on-ramp to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17584)|
| 4:53:06| Pellissippi students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17586)|
| 4:53:08| needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17588)|
| 4:53:10| The other issue that probably needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17590)|
| 4:53:12| is if Coward Mill is cut off, what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17592)|
| 4:53:14| the access to that access road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17594)|
| 4:53:16| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17596)|
| 4:53:18| will all the traffic in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17598)|
| 4:53:20| homes, as Betty said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17600)|
| 4:53:22| the homes that are on Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17602)|
| 4:53:24| we will turn on Cherahala| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17604)|
| 4:53:26| I guess, and come out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17606)|
| 4:53:28| business park, and then that's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17608)|
| 4:53:30| traffic on Middlebrook Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17610)|
| 4:53:32| Yeah, but you'd have a traffic lot regulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17612)|
| 4:53:34| that left turn. Yeah, it would definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17614)|
| 4:53:36| be better. It's just, it's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17616)|
| 4:53:38| interim two to three to four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17618)|
| 4:53:40| that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17620)|
| 4:53:42| in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17622)|

| 4:55:58| there's another 70 acres they'll bring online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17758)|

| 4:56:04| They have dozens of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17764)|
| 4:56:06| available, most, if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17766)|
| 4:56:08| in the BP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17768)|
| 4:56:12| I can recall conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17772)|
| 4:56:14| with former MPC officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| several county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17776)|
| 4:56:18| and utility district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17778)|
| 4:56:20| directors that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17780)|
| 4:56:22| if this project done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17782)|
| 4:56:24| would have purchased all the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17784)|
| 4:56:26| that was put in the SP zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17786)|
| 4:56:28| and put in all the roads and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17788)|
| 4:56:30| I've heard that multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17790)|
| 4:56:32| times over the last 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17792)|
| 4:56:34| that I've been involved, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17794)|
| 4:56:36| in conversation. This is the way it should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17796)|
| 4:56:38| been done. Well, it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17798)|
| 4:56:40| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17800)|
| 4:56:44| I think all the pieces for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17804)|
| 4:56:46| this to succeed and be a win-win for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17806)|
| 4:56:48| everybody in this room, that's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17808)|
| 4:56:50| saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17810)|
| 4:56:52| I just wanted to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17812)|
| 4:56:56| I think you could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17816)|
| 4:56:58| the road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17818)|
| 4:57:00| keep this in a BP zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17820)|
| 4:57:02| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17822)|
| 4:57:04| we'll still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17824)|
| 4:57:06| raising daffodils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17826)|
| 4:57:08| That's just not where market forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17828)|
| 4:57:10| are. People love the community, they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17830)|
| 4:57:12| to live in the community, and Mr. Biddle would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17832)|
| 4:57:14| the opportunity to develop in the community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17834)|
| 4:57:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17836)|
| 4:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17840)|
| 4:57:26| We've been talking about this for like an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17846)|
| 4:57:28| and a half, so I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17848)|
| 4:57:30| everybody's tired of it. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17850)|
| 4:57:32| we go along with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17852)|
| 4:57:34| the MPC has said all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17854)|
| 4:57:36| We go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17856)|
| 4:57:38| even what Mr. Fain was saying. If this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17858)|
| 4:57:40| property, if there was a road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17860)|
| 4:57:42| then maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17862)|
| 4:57:44| a business park would be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17864)|
| 4:57:46| But I think we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17866)|
| 4:57:48| hog-tied here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17868)|
| 4:57:50| so, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17870)|
| 4:57:52| would probably, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17872)|
| 4:57:54| a lot of duress, be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17874)|
| 4:57:56| to go to three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17876)|
| 4:57:58| That's a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17878)|
| 4:58:00| cars extra. We need access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17880)|
| 4:58:02| though, we need access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17882)|
| 4:58:04| We have cotton mills closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17884)|
| 4:58:10| Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17890)|
| 4:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17898)|
| 4:58:20| So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17900)|
| 4:58:22| think we'd be willing to go to three per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17902)|
| 4:58:24| so that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17904)|
| 4:58:26| They have to be willing to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17906)|
| 4:58:28| some land for an access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17908)|
| 4:58:30| available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17910)|
| 4:58:32| We don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17912)|
| 4:58:34| anything over a hundred, nothing even close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17914)|
| 4:58:36| that, because that'll put way, way too much cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17916)|
| 4:58:38| on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17918)|
| 4:58:44| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17924)|
| 4:58:46| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17926)|
| 4:58:48| Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17928)|
| 4:58:50| Since I brought it up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17930)|
| 4:58:52| homeowners association, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17932)|
| 4:58:54| neighbors, so in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17934)|
| 4:58:56| ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17936)|
| 4:58:58| ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17938)|
| 4:59:00| okay, just so I have this clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17940)|
| 4:59:02| so you were at two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17942)|
| 4:59:04| per acre, so now you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17944)|
| 4:59:06| increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17946)|
| 4:59:08| that 48%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17948)|
| 4:59:10| to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17950)|
| 4:59:12| So now what you're asking is the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17952)|
| 4:59:14| to drop his total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17954)|
| 4:59:16| by 15% and meet you at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17956)|
| 4:59:18| the hundred homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17958)|
| 4:59:20| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17960)|
| 4:59:22| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17962)|
| 4:59:26| Well, I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17966)|
| 4:59:28| Benavate has indicated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17968)|
| 4:59:30| I'm not a very good negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17970)|
| 4:59:32| I should have come in here with five and stood on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17972)|
| 4:59:34| that. Maybe I could have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17974)|
| 4:59:36| her up to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17976)|
| 4:59:38| But I was honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17978)|
| 4:59:40| I started out saying 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17980)|
| 4:59:42| and I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17982)|
| 4:59:44| I had started out with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17984)|
| 4:59:46| five and then you all had knocked me down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17986)|
| 4:59:48| to 3.5. We're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17988)|
| 4:59:50| about 12, 15 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17990)|
| 4:59:52| Difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17992)|
| 4:59:54| 100 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17994)|
| 4:59:56| maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17996)|
| 4:59:58| 112 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=17998)|
| 5:00:00| That's it. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18000)|
| 5:00:02| the sweet spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18002)|
| 5:00:04| You're profiting a deal like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18004)|
| 5:00:06| Developers are going to have to spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18006)|
| 5:00:08| Roads, drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18008)|
| 5:00:10| utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18010)|
| 5:00:12| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18012)|
| 5:00:18| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18018)|
| 5:00:22| So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18022)|
| 5:00:24| sticking at the 118 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18024)|
| 5:00:26| You're not willing to compromise to the 100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18026)|
| 5:00:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18028)|
| 5:00:30| Could I recommend we make a compromise and split it in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18030)|
| 5:00:32| at 3.25 or even 3.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18032)|
| 5:00:36| I want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18036)|
| 5:00:38| what the other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18038)|
| 5:00:40| were zoned at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18040)|
| 5:00:42| Everything is 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18042)|
| 5:00:44| is 3 and 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18044)|
| 5:00:46| and they build out a little bit lighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18046)|
| 5:00:48| Every subdivision builds out lighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18048)|
| 5:00:50| The three that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18050)|
| 5:00:52| currently on Coward Mill are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18052)|
| 5:00:54| 3 and 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18054)|
| 5:00:56| Those three subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18056)|
| 5:00:58| Reagan Landing I know is zoned at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18058)|
| 5:01:02| That's how it's zoned, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18062)|
| 5:01:04| It's on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18064)|
| 5:01:06| We're zoning on Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18066)|
| 5:01:08| Oh yeah, on Coward Mill, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| There's not three subdivisions that have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18070)|
| 5:01:12| No, the Magnolia Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18072)|

| 5:01:16| Magnolia Point is on the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18076)|
| 5:01:18| And it's at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18078)|
| 5:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18080)|
| 5:01:22| But the build out is always less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18082)|
| 5:01:24| what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18084)|
| 5:01:26| It just always yields less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18086)|
| 5:01:28| Go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18090)|
| 5:01:32| Now, from what I understand from the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18092)|
| 5:01:34| you're donating some right-of-way, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18094)|
| 5:01:38| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18098)|
| 5:01:40| We agreed to give 30 foot of right-of-way on the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18100)|
| 5:01:42| across there at Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18102)|
| 5:01:44| which would be on the western side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18104)|
| 5:01:46| And that's for a frontage road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18106)|
| 5:01:48| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18108)|
| 5:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18110)|
| 5:01:52| So you're absorbing the cost of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18112)|
| 5:01:54| just to give it back to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18114)|
| 5:01:56| We basically lost four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18116)|
| 5:01:58| when we redid the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18118)|
| 5:02:00| and put that road in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18120)|
| 5:02:02| Is that in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18122)|
| 5:02:04| to what the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18124)|
| 5:02:06| or the state requires you to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18126)|
| 5:02:08| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18128)|
| 5:02:10| he's giving...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18130)|
| 5:02:12| I can't require you to give anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18132)|
| 5:02:14| This is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18134)|
| 5:02:16| Yeah, this is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18136)|
| 5:02:18| No, but I know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18138)|
| 5:02:20| Can you talk into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18140)|
| 5:02:22| Ma'am, can you talk into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18142)|
| 5:02:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18144)|
| 5:02:26| The county requires you to give so many feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18146)|
| 5:02:28| from your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18148)|
| 5:02:30| to where they come over into your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18150)|
| 5:02:32| And I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18152)|
| 5:02:34| is that additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18154)|
| 5:02:36| to what is the state or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18156)|
| 5:02:38| That would be on any existing road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18158)|
| 5:02:40| This is non-existing road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18160)|
| 5:02:42| property that he's giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18162)|
| 5:02:44| This is for the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18164)|
| 5:02:46| I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18166)|
| 5:02:54| Okay, I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18174)|
| 5:02:56| We want to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18176)|
| 5:02:58| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18178)|
| 5:03:02| Are we on sector plan or are we on zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18182)|
| 5:03:12| Brad, you don't want to make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18192)|
| 5:03:16| I think he's going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18196)|
| 5:03:18| He had told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18198)|
| 5:03:26| Okay, I guess the only motion to make here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18206)|
| 5:03:28| is that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18208)|
| 5:03:30| the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18210)|

| 5:03:40| for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18220)|
| 5:03:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18222)|
| 5:03:44| That's not for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18224)|
| 5:03:46| Will it have to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18226)|
| 5:03:52| No, it already has gone back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18232)|
| 5:03:54| and so therefore it's back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18234)|
| 5:03:56| You can act on the LDL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18236)|
| 5:03:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18238)|
| 5:04:00| Okay, so I guess the motion is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18240)|
| 5:04:06| sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-171218?start=18246)|
