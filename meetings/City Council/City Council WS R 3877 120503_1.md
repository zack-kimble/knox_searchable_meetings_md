| 2:23:00| None of you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| You may not want to hear what we've got to say, but you won't wear us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| We do want to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| First off, I want to thank the Mayor, Mayor O'Hara, and her administration for their commitment to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| for the development and support of the Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution Plus Pension Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8592)|
| 2:23:19| and for the recommendation of the additional $10 million contribution from the Rainy Day Fund in the pension budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8599)|
| 2:23:28| or the budget address she gave at the luncheon last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| Again, we've slowly drifted away due to the late hour, but, as I said, we are still here and we will continue to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8613)|
| 2:23:41| I think it's been said a number of times that you can't impact the employees that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| You can't impact the ones that are vested without a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| You can impact the ones that are here that are not vested, and you've not taken a straw poll on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8631)|
| 2:23:58| So I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| You can still change your mind because you did the straw poll on the other, and I hope you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| I have good faith that some of you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| I think each of you received or I was told that you received this information from Pat Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| the employee that compiled all of this or gathered and put this in form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| I just want to call your attention that he looked at the four major cities in Tennessee and Lexington, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8661)|
| 2:24:29| and Atlanta, Georgia, and Memphis has no minimum age for retirement as long as you work there 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8669)|
| 2:24:38| So if you come here as an 18-year-old firefighter or policeman, you can leave when you're 43 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| That's not what the mayor proposed in her hybrid plan for any branch of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8684)|
| 2:24:51| The vesting ranges from five to ten years, and the calculation of benefits ranges from 24 months to 60 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| Exactly what we are now with what's proposed in the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| We've heard much said about the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| Well, one of those plans has a rule of 70 for uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| Employee contributions range from zero in Nashville for all employees to 11 percent in Lexington for uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| An accrual rate ranges from 1.7 to 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| So what does this say about the city of Knoxville pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| It says our current pension plan is in line with other major cities in Tennessee, Lexington, Kentucky, and Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8727)|
| 2:25:35| It says that any changes will have an impact on future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| And I don't care what you say, it will have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| Several workshops ago you heard Chief Roush and Chief Sharp get up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| and they talked about the fine men and women of the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| I don't disagree with the thing they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| That's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| We're all good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| Because if we weren't, we'd have gone home a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| But for just a second, I'd like to address with you two areas of general government where we're going to see an issue when we change the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8759)|
| 2:26:08| We contacted two local engineering firms here in town to get some salary and benefit information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8768)|
| 2:26:16| And when you compare an entry-level engineer with a BS degree at $50,000 yearly at a private company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8776)|
| 2:26:25| with 100 percent employee health care paid by the employer and a 4 percent match on defined contribution, that's for company one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8785)|
| 2:26:34| Company two pays beginning salary $45,000 to $48,000, 100 percent employee health care paid by the employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8794)|
| 2:26:43| and a 3 percent minimum match in bad years and more in good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| A city of Knoxville level one engineer with a degree that we refer to as a civil engineer one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| has a starting salary of $41,249 with various health care options, none of which are paid 100 percent by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8815)|
| 2:27:05| At best, our entry-level salary is $3,000 plus less than the two private firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| The benefits paid by the private companies are significantly more than paid by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| We also ask about their engineers three and engineer four comparable to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8839)|
| 2:27:26| Company one, their beginning salary is $80,000 to $90,000, and company two is $75,000 to $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8846)|
| 2:27:34| The city's $52,148 for a civil engineer three and an engineer four is $58,960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8854)|
| 2:27:47| Substantial discrepancies between private and public companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| We hear all about the private industry, all about the private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| We're not private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| I heard that my entire working career when my husband worked at TDOT and I worked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| Everybody thought we were rolling in the dough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| We weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| We came for the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| That's why we stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| He'd been there 41 years when he passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| I've been here 32 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Folks, it is not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| It's about the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| So the next place we looked was information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| Our help desk people, many of whom you all have met with already, city of Knoxville, starting salary $26,418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8904)|
| 2:28:36| The median range for that same employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| Ms. Cash, you're going to have to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| Median range for that employee is $32,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| We lag behind current surveys from $24,000 to $30,000 just in a help desk technician's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8926)|
| 2:28:56| There are even more in the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| I urge you, listen to the citizens who came before you tonight to support city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8938)|
| 2:29:06| They didn't come here telling you what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| They came here and asked you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| Frederick Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| Thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8962)|
| 2:29:29| Frederick Wagner, 5904 Loyce Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| I work in the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| I've been here almost since I graduated from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| I make $560 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| And I want you to look around the room in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| When I was sitting listening to some of the conversations, and let me first say to Councilman Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| thank you for standing in the gap for us employees out here, because it is not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| It is about the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| When I was sitting out here listening, a poem came to my mind that was written by Dr. Maya Angelou,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9000)|
| 2:30:06| and it simply says, I come as one, but I stand as 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| Now, we're all united in here tonight because of pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| and I'm glad that you protected the vested employees and the non-vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| but I want you to take into account that the person that's going to come in after me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| that's going to have to weed eat in 90-degree weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| that person that's going to have to run in a burning building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| and save his fellow woman or fellow man from a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| It's not about the money, but it is about our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| And you've got to take into account we have lives, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| We have hopes, dreams, and aspirations just like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| You know, when I came here, I signed that dotted line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| There were two things that I knew for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| I wasn't going to make much money, but I would have a decent pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| And when you get out in the rain and have to pick up brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| and have to fix a pothole out in the middle of a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| and take the risk of being mowed over by a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| then you can come and tell me about my plight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| But until that time, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| So you take into consideration all these employees in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| They have all done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| The ones that sit behind the desks, the ones that get out and weed eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| the ones that you don't see at night that I have worked on night shift for overtime to pay for school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9088)|
| 2:31:33| because I go to school part-time, too, that I missed a night to be here because it is important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| You take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| You walk, kneel, and drive or kneel in stadium or Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| or whatever you want to call it four times in one night, and you see how your feet feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| It's not about the money, but it's about the people's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| And the people that are going to come in behind us, you take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| because what I'm doing, they're going to have to do that job also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| And I support the mayor for what she's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| but you take into consideration because you're going to affect a generation of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| And I understand that you've got to do budgets and all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| I understand all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| But you take these people in here into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| because nobody knows our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| You don't know our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9141)|
| 2:32:22| Nobody in here knows it but us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| And when you get out and have to work out in the conditions that we work in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| we might as well work for free for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| So general government does a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| I respect the officers, the firemen, but we're broke down, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| Lifting off three tons of asphalt is not an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| And asphalt is known to cause cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| So, you know, we're out in the line of, you know, we might not have things flying at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| but we're out in the line of fire in other ways, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| So I commend all the people that's in here tonight, the person that sits behind the desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| the person that takes a call to have to go to a robbery, that person that has to go to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| I commend all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| But take into consideration the person that's going to come in after behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| because they're going to do what we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| It's not the salary, but it's the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| And, you know, there's a person that comes to my church the first Saturday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| I'm not going to mention his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| And he's six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| And he has to come to our church to just make it to get by with food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| So you take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| And I thank for what you all have done, but take into consideration the employees in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| And I thank Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| I thank Prudential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| I thank these people that have stood in the gap for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| But when you go home and lay your head down at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| you think of that person that clears the ice and the snow off your road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| and picks up leaves in 20-degree weather where your fingers are numb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| You think of that person because I've done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| and there's some other people in here that have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9239)|
| 2:34:07| Reverend John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9247)|
| 2:34:16| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| It's 804, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| I'm John Butler, 4111 Landon Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9260)|
| 2:34:26| I also pastor the Clinton Chapel and Meson Church at 546 College Street, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| I also am presiding over the Knoxville District Tennessee Conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| and I'm a member of the Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| And I was asked to come to support the mayor's hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9281)|
| 2:34:48| But quite honestly, after sitting here and hearing your discussion, I am thoroughly confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9288)|
| 2:34:57| And I think, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| you all haven't quite grasped all of the terminology and what's the best way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| and what's the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| You know you have something before you you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| I also kind of smiled because when I look at some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| I remember you coming by Clinton Chapel, seeing you at New Hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| at other places when you're running for election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| and here you are with this tough job, with this tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| We would definitely pray with you that you make the best decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| not only for the employees, but for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| So I won't even attempt to tell you what to do or how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| because quite honestly, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| I have to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| I really wanted to come and say I support the mayor's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| but I'm not familiar with it enough to say that's the best plan for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| But I do think it's important that you do think about those employees who are coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| because as this gentleman has just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| what you're talking about is not just what is the plight of the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| and what the city responsibilities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| which quite honestly is why you were elected, why I voted for some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| but also the people who you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| This is the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| These folk are the city, the people who do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| And so I just do, from what I do understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| I do support a hybrid plan that does have the perimeters in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9394)|
| 2:36:41| that protects the city as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| I do also quite honestly support the defined plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| because you know what you're going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| And as a budget person, I like to know what I'm going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| So I think that may be why I'm leaning toward the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| because I believe you can have that and have those things built in to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9420)|
| 2:37:06| You have to work hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Your job is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| So I know how difficult it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| But once again, I echo the remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| Affordable, sustainable, keeping it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| If it's going to be on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| if you put something on the ballot with what we heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| I won't know what to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| So as best possible, present it to the citizens in a way that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| what we're going to have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| But I would support taxes that are going to take care of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| from the fire, police, and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| I support the plan that's been presented by the mayor because people that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| trust and I know support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| People that I've worked with over the last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| police officers who come to the church for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| neighborhood watch program, and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| I'm listening to them, and this is important for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| And I also worked for the government at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| and I have to admit it wasn't the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| I was there for the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9492)|
| 2:38:19| I'm not going to forget you, Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9499)|
| 2:38:26| Put that book away, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| Just so I can see over the podium, Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9508)|
| 2:38:36| Knoxville, Tennessee, president of the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara for trying to get this plan up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| I want to thank all the employees groups for working with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| I want to thank Dr. Lyons for working with us, Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| Chief Sharp, Chief Roush, Mike Cherry, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| You know, we've worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| We, as an association, employees groups, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9544)|
| 2:39:08| we've worked to try and come to a common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9548)|
| 2:39:13| Some of this stuff, like the reverend said, heck, I'm almost confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| I mean, we have some council members, I think is the correct term, bickering on returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| tomato, tomato, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| I don't think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| I think the public watching us on TV, I think the people out here, we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| We're not going to get there in another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| You know, I read this opinion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| The guy didn't sign his name, so I'm assuming it was Jack McElroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| It was pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| But I also read an editorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| We're all supposed to be dead December 21st, according to the editorial I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| But I'm not worried about it really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| Some of the numbers, it's true, the Mayans said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9604)|
| 2:40:12| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| You know, some of the stuff we talked about, you know, pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| You want to drop it down to $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| I don't know if that goes up with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| It's kind of like riding a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| You know, if you're going to feed us, you know, if you're going to give us the money, our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| I mean, we've already shown our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| You know, they said it's not the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| I agree, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Our defined benefit's most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| You know, it's a gamble to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Mr. Martin, Mr. Lyons might have been in the meeting a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| It's Russian roulette, or it's craps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| You know, the purse strings for the city is hoping I die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| If I die, the city gets more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| But like I said, I'm going to try and outlive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| That's why I'm working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| You know, some of the numbers I got from the pension board, it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9664)|
| 2:41:09| Myself and another gentleman who's way smarter than I am, from 1975 to 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9669)|
| 2:41:17| we added up every one of the dollars that the actuary asked the city to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9677)|
| 2:41:24| That was $266,298,696.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9684)|
| 2:41:31| Might be off just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| What the city actually put in was $185,681,394.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9694)|
| 2:41:45| That's underfunded by $90 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| I know it wasn't you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| You know, times are up, times are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| What, if I may ask, what percent of the payroll is going this year, do you know, to fund the pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9713)|
| 2:42:02| Is it about 12%, 13% if you add them up and average them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| Because what I have, they quit doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9727)|
| 2:42:14| But, you know, in 1979 it was 13% payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| 1981, 1982 is 12.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| 77, it was 13.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Yeah, and it was 11.72 on general government and 21.64 on the uniform body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9748)|
| 2:42:34| And let me say that the recommended contributions, they're shown as a dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| but they're also shown as a percentage of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| So if the recommendation is, let's say it's 15% total, that's the recommendation for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9761)|
| 2:42:49| So there's a year lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| And in my experience with the city in the 20 years, the city has always put in the contribution that's been recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| Now, some of the differential may be in that lag in contribution, but, you know, I think that's about what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| What I did, and I did like you there for a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| Mr. Fannis, you got 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| No, I added up all the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| Okay, we're not going to debate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| What I'm getting at is you guys, and I'm not knocking it, you guys talk more than we do about this and that and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9794)|
| 2:43:23| We come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| The mayor came to you trying to put forth a plan to save the taxpayers money, which it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| And we're still not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| We got one more meeting to go, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| Okay, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| David Kitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9824)|
| 2:43:54| David Kitts, 1708 Dancing Light Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| I serve as a supervisor of the Family Crimes Unit of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9839)|
| 2:44:04| This past Monday, some of you all were in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| and I was honored by receiving the Civilian of the Year Award for the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| But that might not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Because back in 2001, I was given two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| One was to take a full-time position at a university up in Louisville, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| or to come down here and work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| The difference was I'd be taking a $12,000-a-year cut to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9871)|
| 2:44:37| Now, as a fifth-generation Knoxvillian, I wanted to come home and raise my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| so they could be the sixth generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| The difference was that pension, those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| I know you're all in a very tough position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| But think about your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| And part of that legacy is what kind of employees do you want to give to the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| Don't force our citizens to settle for second-class, second-rate employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9903)|
| 2:45:10| I urge you to support that mayor's hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9916)|
| 2:45:21| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Time is 8.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| Mark Taylor, 724 Hall of Fame Drive, Fraternal Order of Police President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| I know I've spoke to a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| I appreciate all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| A couple points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| I'd say you probably about give half the command staff of the police department a stroke or an aneurysm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9944)|
| 2:45:51| When you started talking about significantly increasing the pay for a new police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| to that of a captain or a captain in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| The thing is, and this is an excellent point that I'll point out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| these jobs aren't like other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| They require morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| They require discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| They require teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| Without that, not only do the officers out there suffer and accept more risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9976)|
| 2:46:22| because we're doing more with less all the time, and that's been the trend for a long time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9982)|
| 2:46:26| We have less police officers than we did when I came here, less allotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9986)|
| 2:46:30| and we have a lot more ground, a lot more calls, and a lot more responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9990)|
| 2:46:35| And we're handling those in a lot better ways than we were 15, 16 years ago too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=9995)|
| 2:46:40| and exponentially more 20 or 30 years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| When you start adjusting around and you start creating some different casts in organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| the military, police work, fire work, you get at that morale and that discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10012)|
| 2:46:58| It becomes a hard thing to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| And that, I would say, could create a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| And I don't know any way to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| I mean, that portion of it, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| The other thing is we talked about the percentile, the 50th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| There's no way to compensate that person fairly if you substantially change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| or if you go completely away from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| You can't take someone's pay that's been there a year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| and accelerate it to the 20-year veteran's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| You just, I mean, think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| I appreciate all the citizens that came to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| I appreciate your attention to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| I know that was something the council was looking for, input from the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| And I'm glad to finally see that some citizens showed up tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| and had the opportunity to do that and speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| I appreciate all them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10075)|
| 2:47:56| I appreciate all the employees that have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10079)|
| 2:48:06| I see Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| You haven't signed up, but I'm going to assume you want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10087)|
| 2:48:16| We'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| Can you give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| It's 818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Yeah, I'm sorry I was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Ronnie Collins, 4606 Washington Park, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10105)|
| 2:48:33| I was asked to come and speak to in support of the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| I know when I go to work in the mornings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| and I see going down Washington Park and Millertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| and I see my neighbors that are afraid to get in a ditch and trim their yards, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10127)|
| 2:48:53| they'll trim down to the ditch line and then they'll let it grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| and it will be a foot or two tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| If that, and I may be old school, but whatever they're called, city services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10139)|
| 2:49:05| whatever the guy on the tractor that comes by every week or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| and mows those down, they never get cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| They just keep growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| The guys that are out there picking up the trash all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| that are thrown out by a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| Most of you have been to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| You've seen Officer Minner that comes to our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| and how well he presents himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| and how our people really like to have him show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10172)|
| 2:49:40| I almost said Lieutenant Woolridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| I keep forgetting he's been promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| He had a lot to do with keeping that going in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| and our people are always, well, you know, glad to hear what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10190)|
| 2:49:58| and be able to present him with problems that they see in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| and we don't want to lose people like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| I also have never met the man, but Officer Olson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| he was shot two blocks from my house because he was doing his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| and everything I've heard from other officers about him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| I know he's the kind of person we want in our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| and the kind of recruited people we want to keep coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| And I feel that the mayor's plan will help do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=10236)|
