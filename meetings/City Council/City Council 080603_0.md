| 0:00:30| Okay, I'd like to go ahead and call for the June 3rd meeting of City Council, and we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=30)|
| 0:00:42| like to ask Ms. Pelo to ask our invocation and ask Mr. Bailey to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=42)|
| 0:00:54| Let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Our Father, it's good to come before you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| We're so grateful for all the blessings that you have put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=59)|

| 0:01:11| serve others in a way that will make this a wonderful place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=71)|

| 0:01:24| And then we look at the challenges and think sometimes that things are really tough, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| we know that you are there to guide us and to challenge us, that you make us stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| and that we become better servants of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=96)|

| 0:01:52| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=112)|

| 0:02:31| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Any questions, comments, corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| I'd like to make a motion to postpone for four weeks items 9A and 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Well, come on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| I withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| He withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| I withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| And it is a four-weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| The second has to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| The Charter has a rule of thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Martin didn't find that to be humorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| I thought the cold wind kind of come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Having missed the council dinner tonight, I thought gee whiz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| And, you know, I usually try to play along with the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| For those who don't know, he was talking about withdrawing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Any other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Ms. Phelan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| I think this is very serious, that we need to postpone item number 9G, and that would be for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| 9G, item B drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Again, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| I need to postpone 11J, and I guess it would be 10B that it goes with for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| That is the Lonsdale appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| On the H1 and the infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Would you say two weeks, councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Two weeks, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| And both sides have agreed to that, and I'm sure we'll be standing up and saying something if they don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| That's for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Those two items, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Those are postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| I don't believe we have any consent items either, so we will move on to 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| 6A is an application for certificate of compliance for Victor J. Jernigan, DBA Murphys Package Store, LLC, 5914 Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Greg Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| I'm an attorney in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And I'm here to represent the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| And Mr. Jernigan is here this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| That meeting I took a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| I made him come this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| That's made up on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| I was going to let them go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Do you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| It's my understanding from my client that the Murphys, and I believe Kevin Murphy is here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| because if we change the name now, we would have to go all the way back to point A with the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| And we're currently on the June agenda with the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Also, I've learned that if we attempted to change the name now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| we would have to go back through the city's application process also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| So my client, Mr. Jernigan, has spoken with Mr. Murphy and asked him to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| And we're thankful that he came here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| But the bottom line is that the Murphys have agreed that we could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| It would not offend them that we proceed with the application for Murphy's Package Store this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| for the certificate of compliance and also proceed on the third Thursday of this month with the ABC in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| After these two processes have run their course and have been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| then we will then make application with the ABC in Nashville for a name change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| that would be satisfactory with the Murphys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Mr. Murphy, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| I actually just wanted to thank the council for postponing this two weeks, allowing us to reach an agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| We agreed to name either Fogarty's or Murphy Road Wine and Spirits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| Either one of those are acceptable to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So my understanding is that it will go forward when it's advertised and marketed and there's signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| that it will not say Murphy's Package Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| And that's what my family was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Anything else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Based on those representations, move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| And thank the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you all for working that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| For Mayor's Report, let me do two or three things, and I have a couple of different groups I want to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Reminder that the city is going to hold a groundbreaking ceremony, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| for the new transit center at 9 a.m. next Monday, June 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| It will be in the parking lot of the Old American Accessories Building on the corner of Church and Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| We're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Operations are still probably a little bit less than two years away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| but we finally have a groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| We'd love to see all of you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Market Square, Gay Street, and Old City Art Galleries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=470)|

| 0:08:55| Just a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| The Youth Action Council is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Folks apply from high schools all throughout the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| And the folks sitting before you represent, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| a pretty good cross-section of our entire city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| They're selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| You don't just get to apply and get to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| They're picked out of a lot of worthy recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| And then they spend a year trying to understand better how they can tie in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and help other basically high school folks tie into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| and be a bigger part of what we do and the decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| So I think this is – is this our fourth group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=570)|

| 0:09:37| And I know Mary Martin with the county and Tank with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| and some other folks help on the selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| and really help all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| So thank you all for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=587)|

| 0:10:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Yeah, just to remind folks on, I guess, mostly at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| and council people know it, next Thursday, June 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| a workshop on accessory buildings and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I'm trying to move forward on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| And I'm betting in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| MPC would be here, so I think it's small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Well, along that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I was thinking Mark Donaldson might want to comment on the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Is it tomorrow night, the public hearing tomorrow night on 04?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| Yes, tomorrow evening at 7 o'clock in the small assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| a public meeting on the new proposed office slash residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| There's a lot of interest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| and I wanted our viewing audience to be aware of that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Yes, just a reminder that the transportation planning organization is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| holding public hearings or public workshops, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| on the regional mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| There will be one tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| There are three left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=676)|

| 0:11:28| and one at the Cedar Bluff Public Library at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| and those will be the last of that series of public workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| on the regional mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| So anybody that's interested in transportation issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| and the long-range plan addressing that, it's not just highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| it's transit, it's walking and bicycling, all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| I would encourage you to go and put in your two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=708)|

| 0:15:11| I want to thank Larry Martin and Dr. Lyons and Vicki Hatfield for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| leadership as the heads of that advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| And I want to also thank Councilman Becker for his input in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| as well as all the other senior directors who served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| I can honestly say that this is one time that we went in there as equals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| and everybody felt like everybody was able to say what they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| and everybody listened to what everybody else had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| And I just, again, want to thank you for your commitment and for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| And as I said earlier, not everybody's happy, but they never will be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| So we need to get over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| And just thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=953)|

| 0:17:02| Before we go, I want to thank people for those in the Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| We actually just passed a budget, which you might think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| well, it didn't seem like a whole lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| But it really is a symbol of a lot of work that people in the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| and civil service, employee groups, and really council do throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| to make certain that everybody stays understanding what the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| So I appreciate council working so hard to help us get to a good number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| and we thank you for the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1047)|

| 0:18:03| to the qualified voters of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| for approval as provided in Article 11, Section 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| We do have a speaker sign up, Anita Cash, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| Once again, my name is Anita Cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| and I am here on behalf of General Government Employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| I'm not so sure I'm here to talk in opposition to this pension amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| but I want to remind each of you that you've already passed an ordinance once in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| that put this item on the ballot that the voters voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| In 2006, the General Government Employees presented you with a similar ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| to amend Pension Plan G to increase the multiplier for current city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| And for whatever reason, that ordinance failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and the voters never got to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| And I just want to remind you that city school people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| haven't paid one red cent into this plan in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| and current General Government Employees pay into their pension plan every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| So I want to tell you and promise you that if you put this on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| you will see an ordinance again from the General Government Employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| asking to put it on the November ballot to increase their multiplier again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| You know, I know we talked a little bit about this at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| and I guess I'll just jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| There are a couple of thoughts that come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| One, in talking sort of related to what Anita brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| one of the things that we said is, well, it was only $160,000 this is costing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| And it feels to me like a bad road to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| We've done this a couple times where pension plan adjustments come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and they're not that expensive, so we approve them and send them to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And what that means is the big change is that it's going to affect a lot of people we don't deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| You know, they are expensive, and we get freaked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I don't know if it would be a little smarter for us to do something a little more comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| to say, you know, to ask the pension board to look at a whole series of changes for us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| rather than just look at one now and again that it affects a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| So it's not a big deal, but it seems like not the best way to do government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Mr. Becker, I will respectfully add that it costs $160,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| Per year, exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| So over 15 years, it's nearly $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| And I did support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I looked back at my voting record in 2006, and I did support this on first and second reading in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| But I think to Mrs. Cash's point, the voters have been given an opportunity to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| and there's a little bit of a sense of double jeopardy or something, you know, with this to bring it back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| The voters have had an opportunity to speak, and so I plan to vote against it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Ms. Marquess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Councilman Peel, that light was on before mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| It really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I was just going to suggest that Mr. Cherry is here from the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and he might comment as to how these things are brought to the Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| and how they then reach counsel to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Mr. Cherry, if you want to come down and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Because there is a process, and I would appreciate you explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Mike Cherry, Executive Director of the Knoxville Pension Board, 917 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| If the Council, I'm sure, will remember that I think actually at the Pension Board's behest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| approved a new procedure for all of the recommended changes to the pension section of the city charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1310)|
| 0:22:00| where that any employee group or, for that matter, anyone who wanted to affect a change to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| would have to present their proposal to the Pension Board by a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| certainly 60 days before the first reading, and then we, the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| and I believe you all received that under the new procedure required to provide a report to the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| indicating, first of all, just making sure that the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| which hopefully is in kind of final form, you know, is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| We've looked at that and make sure it fits in with all of the other sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| that already exist in the pension charter as well as making sure that any of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| wouldn't jeopardize the IRS qualification of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Obviously, that's the purpose for having an opportunity to do that at the Pension Board level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| so that it doesn't get too far along without some really grave concerns from the Pension Board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And then, secondly, also to provide the cost estimate for any proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I have a question for Mr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Ms. Cherry, we'll let Ms. Roddy go ahead and ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| While you're here, Mr. Cherry, I understand from our Council information sheet that in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| when this came through, the Pension Board recommended the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| but this time the Pension Board is staying neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Is that a correct assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I think that would be correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| That was recommended two years ago, but it doesn't come with a recommendation one way or the other this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Well, after hearing Mr. Cherry's comments and certainly Councilman Becker and Councilman Roddy's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| I would have to concur with my Council colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| And to tell the truth, I don't remember how I voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| I wish I could say I remembered how I voted on every item, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| But I think, again, I agree with the comment that it's similar to double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| It's come up once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| I don't know if that's the best description, but it's close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| It's come up once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| And why are we revisiting this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Going back to Councilman Becker's concerns, I think the flip side of that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| and I'm not accusing anybody of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| but sometimes it may appear easier to get one item through because it's only going to cost X dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| than it is to get a whole slate of items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| even though the comprehensive approach probably makes a lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| It may not be the preferable approach for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| But I did vote for this on first reading just to give it a good hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| but I'm not going to support it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| We better do the voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Motion fails three to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| 9E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Chapter 5, Article 6, concerning dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I was looking at this this afternoon, and I have some real concerns about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| and am wondering if a postponement might be appropriate to allow some more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| to hear from some folks about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I'm wondering if folks, particularly who breed their dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| or whose dogs are very valuable, are aware of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| The change that I'm concerned about is the mandatory spay-neuter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| at the designation of a Level 1 dangerous dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| And my concern lies in the fact that it's kind of a no-forgiveness policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| The way our ordinance read previously, if you were designated a Level 1 dangerous dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| and you made modifications, so you did training with your animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| and there were no further violations, then after 18 months that designation dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| If during that period you were promoted, so to speak, onto a Level 2 dangerous dog designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| then the current ordinance does have the requirement that spay-neuter occur on that animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| I'm concerned that there is enough leeway in the three criteria for Level 1 designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| that a dog could be designated Level 1 and this mandatory spay-neuter provision kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| And some animals are very, very valuable to their owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| and this is a loss in value to an animal that's a stud dog or used for breeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| I understand that spay-neuter is a policy that we'd like to see more of in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| because of overpopulation of animals, but I think there are other ways to get at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| rather than targeting this dangerous dog population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| I think, you know, typically in our laws we're fairly forgiving on a first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| which is how the original ordinance read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| And then when there's a second offense, we say, okay, you're not taking care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| We're going to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| And I really have trouble with the spay-neuter on a first offense Level 1 dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| There's someone here from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I can't see to the right of me all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Cindy is here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| About you all's position on the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| obviously you vetted it and this kind of came from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| and why this recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| And actually also if you could very briefly for our people at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| explain what a Level 1 dangerous dog is, how you qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Well, we support the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| And a Level 1 dangerous dog is when an unprovoked, while on the property of its owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| attacked a person on two or more occasions within a prior 24-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| or has within a 24-month period, while off the property of its owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| engaged in any behavior when unprovoked that reasonably would have required a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| to take a defensive action to prevent bodily injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| And then three has when unprovoked, while off the property of its owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| bitten a person or a domestic animal causing minor injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| And that's a Level 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| To get designated Level 1, does that have to go through any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| such as to the municipal court or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Or does that just happen based on someone complaining that a dog bit me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| The municipal court shall designate a dog as a Level 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| So it actually goes through a judicial sort of process at the municipal court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| And you all support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Well, I guess, you know, Ms. Grutter, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| But I also do not have a problem with anybody saying I want more time to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| So, I mean, I would actually not be opposed to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I don't think it would change my vote at all, and I'm comfortable voting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| But if you want to make that motion, I would second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| I was just going to ask if you're going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I'd like to move to postpone this for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| And my concern, you know, is within these three possible criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| for being designated a Level 1 dangerous dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| You know, one of them is when the dog is off its property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| it bites another animal or person causing minor injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Well, I'm thinking about the situations that we've been hearing about at Cherokee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| where folks think, you know, that it's a dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| So I take my dog down there, and the dog is off the leash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| and it bites another dog causing a minor injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| That's the language in the wording in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Then I get cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| I go to court, and my dog has to be spayed or neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| I think the punishment is too severe for this type of infraction on a first infraction basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| So I'd like to propose four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| The motion on the floor is a postponement for four weeks, and it's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Let me ask, because it tends to fall to myself and council staff to manage this portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| what do we envision the public participation piece being over the next four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| since the reason we're postponing it is to allow for some public input of notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And I'm trying to understand, are we going to get a call in the next two or three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| to try and get a workshop on this, or are we just going to leave it out there in the public domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| and if nobody responds in four weeks, then that's good enough for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| I just want to get a feel for that so that I know what the expectation is of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| or staff with regards to that, if this is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Since I'm the one asking for the postponement, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| I guess I don't have the expectation of a workshop, but, you know, perhaps the media will cover this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| If they don't, I mean, I guess I just don't feel like a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I made some phone calls this afternoon, and the folks that I spoke with had no idea that this was on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and they had concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| They said, you know, would this be a surprise to you if your dog was sighted under one of these circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and you came to court and were found guilty of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| and were told you had to spay or neuter your dog?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| Yeah, that was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| So I guess I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Maybe other council members feel like it needs a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| And I wouldn't suggest we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| I just want to make sure that somehow I didn't have a clear understanding of the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| just in case there was some expected action on behalf of me or the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| in regards to that public participation piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I just think there can be a significant loss of assuming your animal is your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| which I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| There's a significant loss of property value under this new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| and I just want to make very sure that folks in the community know that we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| before we start enforcing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Okay, the motion and the second on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1911)|

| 0:32:49| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I'd like to hear from Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| At the last meeting we asked that he meet with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I know Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Maybe between the two of them they can kind of tell us the results of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| I think council will be pleased with regards to those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| So please, Mr. Jones and or Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| T. Scott Jones, 500 Gwynhurst Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| I want to thank council for the suggestions at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| I did have an opportunity to meet with the two mics of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| They came out to the car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| We went over some plans with regards to scheming so that we got into or screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| I said scheming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| That didn't come out right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| That's a little faux pas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| But it was a screening scheme, so we had a little bit of a play on words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| so that we would fit into what would be considered the Magnolia Avenue corridor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And they actually were kind enough to draw some things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| And we even discussed the type of trees and the type of vegetation that they would like planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| I think Councilman Becker was sent a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I know Mark has a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So that's something that we're certainly going to do, honor that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| And we'll begin work on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| and hopefully continue to be a viable business on the East Knoxville side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Mr. Donaldson, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I appreciate contacting our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and they did put together a plan that helps meet the goals that have been established with the corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| creating a better pedestrian atmosphere along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and helping to define the access to the lot through landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| So it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2071)|

| 0:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Then there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2077)|

| 0:34:43| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| to approve a use on review request for a 90-foot monopole telecommunications tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| subject to seven conditions in an R1 zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| property located on the northwest side of Grove Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| southeast of Rifle Range Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| in conjunction with Resolution 11I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| which is a resolution approving an appeal by Fountain City Town Hall, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| We've got representatives from Fountain City Town Hall and U.S. Cellular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| Ultimately, you're going to hear that this is going to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| but I want to thank everyone for being willing to sit down in a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and have numerous telephone conversations to try to get this worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| We also need to thank KEB and KGIS for trying to find us some alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| So hopefully this one that's going to be going up, another company can co-locate on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| so hopefully we won't need to put up another cell phone tower in this vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| for a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| We do have two folks who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Ms. Jamie Rowe, who's for the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| and Mr. Jackson Kramer, who's against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Ms. Rowe would go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| We're not really for it after meeting with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| but I would like to just read our letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Fountain City Town Hall would like to express our appreciation first to the U.S. Cellular Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| for meeting with us and the neighborhood representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| to discuss our concerns regarding the proposed cell phone tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| We're grateful for the effort and the time that U.S. Cellular spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| looking at additional sites to co-locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| rather than establish a new tower at the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Also, we're in agreement with the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| regarding plans to remove as few trees as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| We appreciate the time Councilman Frost spent at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| with the cell phone company and the community concerning this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| As we expressed to the representatives of U.S. Cellular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| the major concern of Town Hall is the placement of a cell phone tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| deep within a neighborhood zoned R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| setting a precedent regarding the location of towers in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| As you know, the Knoxville City Wireless Communication Facilities Plan, dated 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| lists low-density residential and ridgetops as avoidance areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| We realize this plan is only guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| but we have concerns that this could lead to additional towers in avoidance zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| U.S. Cellular has assured us that they do not intend to use this instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| as a precedent setting use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| And furthermore, U.S. Cellular representatives stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| that each case should be decided on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| We hope other cell phone companies will exhibit the same attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Sincerely, Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you, Jamie. Mr. Kramer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| I don't have much to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I would simply say that we also appreciate the willingness of the Town Hall representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| to meet with us because we're always willing to do what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| to make these facilities as low-impact as we can and still meet our needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| and we're grateful for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2284)|

| 0:38:20| essentially the same design that we discussed for the Wise Hills location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2306)|

| 0:38:33| There's no bulb out or anything on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Similar to the one across from the McGee-Tyson Airport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2316)|

| 0:41:47| to provide consulting services for the city's employee deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Ms. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| This question, I guess, is for Mr. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and I think the contract with the consultant overall sounds like a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| I would just like more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| The sheet states that you anticipate that cost savings will pay for the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| in its first year, but this is a five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| So how do you anticipate it costing out over the following four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| This is a consultant that would advise us relative, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| to the deferred comp plan for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| The savings will come in several ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| One, first advising us as we put this out for request for qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| and take a look at our plan cost as well as the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| the array of investment choices that we will have for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| We actually have pretty good penetration with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| In other words, good participation on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| But they're limited in the variety, if you will, of investments that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| So we think that there's some work to be done here relative to education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| as well as investment choices along with the cost that we're incurring today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| for the choices that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| So while it is a contract that would be extended for the consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| those savings that we think can be achieved would be achieved each of those plan years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| I guess many of the areas that the consultant is going to advise us on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| it seems to be heavily front-end weighted in terms of the consultant's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Many of these descriptions would happen in the first year of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| And so I'm trying to understand your recommendation for a five-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| In other words, I understand them helping us with the RFQ process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and developing a policy and advising a new committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| And then once all that's launched, do we still need them at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| That's a very good question and a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Clearly, there is a good bit of work on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| because we've not had a consultant to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| But remember that these investment choices, investment performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| relative to those who are providing the various investments, change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| And what Morgan Keegan would provide us is help in assessing the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| of the various investment choices that we are making available to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| And so we have some responsibility there for good oversight of those investment choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| that are afforded to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Morgan Keegan would be assisting us in those assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| So it sounds like you anticipate that the city would need this assistance ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| without an end date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I mean, past the five years of this contract, the kind of consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| and knowledge that you're talking about is something that you would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| as long as you're offering this kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| That is our feeling today, that we would need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Now, you know, rules, regulations, things like this may change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| as far as the availability of deferred comp, you know, the tax consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| All of those things could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| They would change your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| But our feeling is that this is money well spent on behalf of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| and the employees who participate in it because it will provide good advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and counsel to us on the front end and then each year thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| as we assess the performance of the underlying investment choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And, again, the cost of the contract is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| or what we are paying to the consultant is the same for all five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| even though their advice is more heavily weighted in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| I guess they're amortizing their costs across the five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Is this what is currently being done by Alan Sheets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Alan Sheets is with Nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| and Nationwide is our provider of the deferred comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Morgan Keegan will actually be a consultant to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| to evaluate providers of the deferred comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| So we might be moving away from Nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| We may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| What we will be doing, Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| is putting out a request for proposals relative to our deferred comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2775)|
| 0:46:22| So we're staying with Nationwide for right now, but that might be changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Well, we will go through a request process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| and Morgan Keegan, the first step, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| is for Council tonight to approve this arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| And then once that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| then the first work that Morgan Keegan will be doing would be advising us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| on putting this out for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Would this, Mr. Martin, be similar to the consulting firms that the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2808)|
| 0:46:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| This would be, you're right, Councilmember Filo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| it would be similar to what Summit Strategies does for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Morgan Keegan would be advising us as to the number of investment choices we should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| who some of those investment choices should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| And that is absolutely a crucial exercise, I believe, for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| And this is in this particular year where investments are such a question mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| It has been so very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| We have completely reevaluated many of the investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| and it has been an absolutely invaluable tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| So I would think that it would also be an invaluable tool in respect to these deferred plans and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2857)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Who's going to make the decision, Deputy Martin, with regards to who is successful in the RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| Is Morgan Keegan going to say, here's who we recommend to you, administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| and you all will be bound by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Or are they going to give you three names, one name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Or how is that going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| No, we would go through our normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| We'll have a selection committee that we will name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Morgan Keegan would simply be an advisor to that selection committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| to help us evaluate the proposals that are presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| and help guide us as to the choices we make there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Ultimately, I guess you and the mayor and you all's department would decide on after that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| And we would be back to council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| That was just not quite as clear to me about how that part of it was going to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Is that an old lighter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Stellar Visions and Sound Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| to provide and operate video and sound equipment for the city of Knoxville's July 4, 2008 festivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| at World's Fair Park in a total amount not to exceed $30,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| I had a question for Ms. Maloney this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| and she was able to clarify for me that in the council information sheet it indicates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| the equipment would display sponsor logos and advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| but it's really only going to be sponsor information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Yes, I'm Mickey Maloney, Director of Special Events, 112 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| Mayor and council, thank you very much for this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| We do not have advertisement on these screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| They are logo recognitions of sponsors that provide funding for July 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| My question was would there be compensating revenue to offset this cost if advertising was taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| and perhaps in the future that's a program that could be expanded upon during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| when they're not being used to broadcast the concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| You know, folks could buy advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| and that would help offset the cost to the city of the setup and rental of these screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| And that is a very, very good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| We'll certainly take that under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I do have a correction in the contract on page 1 under witnessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3009)|
| 0:50:19| It does say a 9-by-12-foot LED video screen and one 18-inch-by-24-inch screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3019)|
| 0:50:29| That should be 18 feet by 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Hold on, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| I'm again that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| We would be paying a lot per foot or per inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3045)|

| 0:50:47| 12A is an ordinance to amend the capital budget and the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3047)|

| 0:51:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3067)|

| 0:51:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| 12B is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 0708.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| I just want to make sure that everybody realizes that in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| we're using appropriated fund balance to cover the deficit with cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And I think we all know where that's coming from with rising fuel costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| and Mr. Anderson was very candid during our budget hearings about his commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| to looking at how we're running cap for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and trying to make some fundamental changes where they can be made to try to have a more balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| This is no criticism of cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| There's been certainly circumstances outside their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| But when we have to appropriate fund balance to balance it out at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| to the tune of half a million dollars, that's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So I appreciate Mr. Anderson's commitment to looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| and I know there's a workshop coming up, an all-day event at the O'Connor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| and I hope that we can come up with some creative strategies to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| I think that's well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3135)|

| 0:52:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| We do have two folks signed up to speak on this, Joyce Feld and Duane Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| Joyce, if you want to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| First, I would like to say that I appreciate the intent of the proposed amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| which is to tighten the regulations concerning electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| However, I have to say that I see all EMCs as a highly intrusive form of visual pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| and a possible safety hazard as well, even with the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| I suppose the businesses that employ them feel they attract more customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| But for me, an EMC says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| this business doesn't care about the beauty and character of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| and it makes me not want to patronize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Nor do I see them as necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| as businesses that have additional locations in communities where EMCs are not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| such as Farragut, seem to be doing just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| So my preference is that tonight City Council considers banning all EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| But given the document before you, I would like to express some concerns and make some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| The first concern is the requirement that a property has a minimum of 200 feet of frontage on a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| To reduce the proliferation of these signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| I'd like to see this requirement increased to perhaps 250 or 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| At 200 feet, with signs running along both sides of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| it's possible for a person to have two or more EMCs in view at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| That's overload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| In addition, most of the proposed amendments in this document will be retroactive upon passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| but this one will not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| And for the reasons stated above, I think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| Also, I suspect the intent of this requirement is that there be a minimum of 200 feet of frontage on the front of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| the street named in the business's address, such as Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| Yet there's at least one business that I know of on a corner lot that derives its 200 feet of frontage from the small side street that it abuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3301)|
| 0:55:11| It should also be noted that some applicants have been meeting the required 200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| by adding together frontage on more than one bordering street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| But I think controls are now in place which address this practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| In some circumstances, the proposed amendments allow an EMC to be as big as 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| a size that seems unnecessarily immense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| I don't know what the appropriate size should be, but I would think it should be a lot smaller than 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3339)|
| 0:55:47| Another concern I have is Article 8, that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| an EMC must be equipped with a dimming sensor switch that automatically calculates lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| and adjusts itself accordingly, close quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| I would ask, adjust itself relative to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| How will it be determined how bright an EMC should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Who will monitor this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| And what will the consequences be for noncompliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| I also suggest that there be a limit on the brightness and number of colors that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| We've all seen the amazingly garish, brightly colored EMC of a certain fast food restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| and I suspect there are few among us who don't find it offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| This same restaurant, by the way, has no such sign in its Farragut location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| Finally, I would like to take issue with the statement in this document that states, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages, close quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| Personally, for myself, I would much prefer to have a pleasant, scenic, safe drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| than to know that aspirin or shrimp are on sale today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you very much for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Thank you. Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| Mr. Mayor, City Council, I'm Dwayne Greve, number eight, Emory Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| As the president of Scenic Knoxville, I'm here to neither support nor oppose the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| to the Knoxville Ordinance governing the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| Scenic Knoxville believes it is important to have businesses' identifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| and for property owners to be able to reasonably advertise their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| We do not want to see the scenic beauty of our city become overrun by a proliferation of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| We hope that you will take into consideration how these new regulations will be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| We're very much concerned about the enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| We commend the Metropolitan Planning Commission for attempting to lessen the danger posed by the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| The proposed changes to the operational characteristics of these signs may make them less distracting for motorists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| and we applaud that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| We also commend the effort to at least stop the scrolling and the flashing of the signs that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| especially along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Of course, City Council's power to regulate signage is based on several factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| Controlling traffic hazard is one, and most importantly, the aesthetic of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| The power to regulate signage rests on your interest in and the role as protector of the community appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| As a group, Scenic Knoxville favors the protection of the visual landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| As I understand it, the current law governing EMCs was enacted several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| Several questions we have are, has an assessment of how the ordinance is working been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| Our observations come up with many of the EMCs that have been installed and operated are in violation of the present ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3540)|
| 0:59:10| How do we regulate these ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| We hope that Council will amend the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| but also consider keeping the moratorium on new signs in place until such an assessment can be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| to show whether the ordinance can be effective in improving the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| and reducing the visual proliferation that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| Some of the other issues, and Ms. Feld addressed several of these, additional concerns that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3571)|
| 0:59:39| electronic message centers over-commercialize areas and work against the main purpose of signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| which is to mark a business's location, not to announce the latest discount or the latest flavored drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| Scenic Knoxville would like to see additional regulations to control the number of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Vague language governing brightness should give more guidance for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| Language regarding the 200-foot fronting should also be tightened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| Council and MPC should consider use of property and appropriateness of the EMCs for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| In closing, our main concern is that the regulation of the ordinance and a bit more clarification be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| We're also concerned that our understanding is that the MPC study was done with the sign industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| I hope this is not the camel's nose under the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Mr. Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Our moratorium is in effect until when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| I think it just ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| I've heard something like Thursday, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Until we take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| How long is the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| As I recall, it was a 90-day moratorium or until final action was taken with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| I do not recall when the 90 days started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Mr. Donaldson may know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I was told that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| This question is for Ms. Cash, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| One of the questions that the speakers addressed was how effective our current ordinances have been in regulating the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3674)|
| 1:01:24| And so within the intent of our current ordinances, what has been your experience in terms of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| Are the regulations that we currently have too vague?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Are they effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| How does it play out in the field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| There are some issues that were vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| There were some interpretation issues that we have recently addressed with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Our department, our director, has recently addressed with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| It is our belief that with these regulations that is before you tonight, that it will continue to tighten up on the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| And the enforcement will be the changes that are before you tonight can be done with the flip of a switch at an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3721)|
| 1:02:11| It's nothing they have to go out and physically do on their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| It's done through a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| It's operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| And there is an amortization schedule for compliance with these new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| When the original regulations were put into effect with the committee that you served on, Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| we did not make the existing EMCs at that time comply with the new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| However, there is a clause in here that requires all EMCs to comply with these new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| So nothing operationally will be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| However, my understanding, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| So operationally, nothing is grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Everybody, after the phase-in period, has to comply with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| But, however, if we have EMCs that are present where the business does not have the full 200 feet of street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3772)|
| 1:03:01| let's say they have 180 or whatever, they are grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| In other words, because that would require taking down the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| So businesses that are not compliant under the 200 feet are grandfathered with this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Prior to the original amendment several years ago, when you were on that committee, there was no ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| If you had 10 feet frontage, you could have an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Of any size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Of any size, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| And you are correct that there is no change in here that makes someone that does not have 200 feet take down an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3810)|
| 1:03:40| Do you feel like the language that's currently before us is vague regarding how you measure that 200 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3820)|
| 1:03:51| Ms. Feld mentioned situations where perhaps businesses that sit in a corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| and have under 200 feet on their addressed thoroughfare, say, Kingston Pike or Clinton Highway or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3836)|
| 1:04:05| but they do have the 200 feet on the corner back the other way, then I guess they felt they've been permittable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| And do you feel like that's – it seems like the intent of the ordinance is 200 feet on your street frontage where you have your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3852)|
| 1:04:20| and yet that's not really – that language is not in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Is that going to provide an interpretation problem for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| That was one of the issues that Tom Reynolds, our building zoning plans review chief, Gary Norman, our building inspections director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| myself and Scott Brenneman, the sign enforcement director, met with the law director two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| And that is one of the items that we did discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| and there will be an official interpretation by the building official, Gary Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| that says the 200 feet will be measured on the street where your property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| Where it's addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| So that would affect not only corner misinterpretation but where a property goes all the way through front to back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| and you have, say, an alley and a front and you can't add those two up to get your 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| It's got to be 200 on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| I think that's all my questions for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| Mr. Donaldson, when the MPC considered this amendment, what all did they actually consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3923)|
| 1:05:32| Did they consider a complete ban on EMCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| No, they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| This effort is a residual from the dynamic display for billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| One of the options that we considered at that time was creating a set of regulations to apply to both billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| and on-premise signs in the form of EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| They wanted to separate those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| so we ended up carrying forward the recommendation for the C2 option, if you'll recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| That was the original option C with these amendments that you see tonight stripped out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3966)|
| 1:06:15| So we're just following up with their desire to address EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| but to focus on the operational characteristics only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| So this council, even though there's been interest expressed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| and perhaps an eventual out-and-out ban on EMCs, this council can't consider that tonight, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| without it going back to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Mr. Frost, and then we'll come back over to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| First, Mr. Swanson and I were talking about that interpretation that was just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| about trying to make that interpretation as easy as possible with just maybe amending the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4015)|
| 1:07:03| Like, for example, in section E, commercial districts, little section E1, change it to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| an EMC shall be limited to parcels with a minimum of 200 feet of frontage on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4031)|
| 1:07:20| And would you do the same for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| We would do the same for all the other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| and hopefully that would make things a whole lot easier and reduce any potential necessity for an interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4044)|
| 1:07:35| I didn't know how folks thought about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| and that same sort of amendment would apply to the industrial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| and the other districts where EMCs are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| I mean, I'll make that motion if folks are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| That's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Okay, and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Your light's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I need discussion to the amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Actually, it happens that mine is because that same concern was one that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| And just to follow it up with a statement, because this has been a concern of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| I have had several conversations kind of criticizing the fact that I don't think there's been the proper enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| and it has really disturbed me that I've seen moving images and so on that I know are not now permitted cropping up here and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4107)|
| 1:08:38| and have asked why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| And I have been told it's a matter of interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| And so I think, you know, in any way that we can avoid this interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| it will benefit both your department and certainly the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| And I think that's something that has just kind of, it's a creeping disease with this situation of EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4135)|
| 1:09:05| And having spent all the time we did with that study task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I'm just extremely disappointed that the enforcement was not there to provide what we thought to be some of the safeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4149)|
| 1:09:19| against this creeping disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I don't love these signs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| But I do think, and it goes back to my position I took on digital billboards and dynamic display, whatever we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| that I think it's crucial that we have the opportunity to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| So for that reason, I'm very pleased to see this come to us for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| For Ms. Poplin or Mr. Reynolds, is there any problem with putting into law what Mr. Frost is saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| That sounds like a good thing, but is there any problem with doing that in law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| From a legal standpoint, I don't see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| We're still on the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| We're still on the amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| We're getting ready to vote on the amendment if I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| I'm assuming Mr. Becker's is an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| There is a parallel clause under the section G, industrial districts, so I'm sure that applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I think part of his motion included all other parallel sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| We're voting on the amendment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Now we're back on voting on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| A question and then another amendment I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Mr. Donaldson, I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| I'm always concerned about this thing that an EMC can be up to one-third the size of the total sign permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| and my sense is that would encourage people to build bigger signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| and I'm wondering if you all thought about that and what your sense is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Is that a problem, and can we deal with it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| During the review process for the billboard issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| we held a meeting with all of the sign companies that deal with EMCs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| and anecdotally they reported to me that in order to achieve the minimum square footage of 20 square feet for an EMC display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4271)|
| 1:11:22| some people had to increase their overall sign size to fit under the 33 percent maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| So there is some anecdotal evidence that that may be occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| and it's probably an issue we could look at and analyze further at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| I'd like to offer an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| but I'd like to delete the language in Section A-4 where it says no sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| and I want to delete accept government-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| I just don't like this idea that we exempt ourselves from our own laws so blatantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| We ought to be covering this like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| So I'm going to offer an amendment to delete those four little words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| The amendment in the second is to delete the words accept government-owned sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| And I'm going to take the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Ms. Roddy just came on for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Mr. Becker, what are the government-owned signs that we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| I know there's a separate clause in here regarding historic signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| and so that brings to mind the Tennessee Sierra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| We had a long discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| So government signs that would currently be exempted if this were not amended would be such as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| Well, the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| We can't regulate state signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| so basically we'd be saying that we're just not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| that the city isn't going to follow the city's own ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| Well, I guess tourism and sports and bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| The what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| The tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| It's not city-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| They have the circulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| It's not government-owned, I don't think, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| So Thompson Bowling would not be because that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| That's why that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Mr. Bailey, and then I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Yeah, Mayor, I'm just sort of curious about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| I'd have to think into that one a little bit more, what that would involve and why it was included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| And I understand your intent, but I don't know what all that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| Yeah, I don't know if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Yeah, Ms. Poplar can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| The thoughts behind that would be if there was some public purpose for the message that needed to be out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| if it needed to not hold static for the, it was five, now the ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| And it was just concerns such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| And we reflect back to some of, I guess, the state, the road signs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| I mean, those are regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| But in the event the city would need those types of signs with some message that would operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| need to operate more quickly than the static hold time for EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| I'll come back in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| You want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Go ahead then, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| I guess, I mean, my thought, I understand the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| It just feels like if we're telling other people you're never going to have anything important enough to need this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| then I don't know why we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| It just feels a little good for the goose, good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| And, again, I trust the wisdom of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| I think, and Debbie, correct me if I'm wrong, I think we're okay with taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| I think the original concern was was there a public safety reason where that might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| I think we're okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| If you want to take that out, I think for our standpoint, we think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| But that was why it was originally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I think it's that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Different light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Mr. Hoekstra, this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Just to follow up, Mr. Becker, and based on what Ms. Poplin said, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| it doesn't sound like there's any clear concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| There may be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| If that's the case, I think we can deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| If it comes up, hopefully we'll have enough warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| If not, we can, I don't know what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Like for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Cheating and getting cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| But it's an emergency situation is what we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| I mean, we really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| And so to try to say, well, something someday might happen, I tend to go with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| I say let's just play by the same rules for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| And then if we see a problem, we'll address it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I guess I'm kind of like Councilman Bailey right now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| trying to understand the whole impact here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| And actually the logic that comes out of it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| tends to apply to the whole paragraph of four with regards to the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| equal treatment, you know, argument that's come from Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| You know, even into the downtown design guidelines, review, H1 overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| you know, that really opens up that whole discussion, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| which is an interesting one because I understand what we've got downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| We've got some beautiful signs downtown, I guess, if people want to call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| of the Tennessee Theater and the new movie theater that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| we're allowing some of those things to happen downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| but we're telling folk in other places you can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| which is kind of what I hear from Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So, you know, this whole thing right now, the way we are right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| and with this is kind of troubling to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| but I just only can speak to the motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| So I understand where Councilman Becker is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| and I do wonder about being able to explain to some areas, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| but other areas, yes, just because you happen to be geographically in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| downtown area or geographically in a historic area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| we're going to let you do a few things that we're not going to let other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| There's something a little unsettling about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I think it's probably defensible with the great attorneys we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| but it's still, you know, something that's not quite balancing out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| What about this is first reading, as Jethro in the Beverly Hillbillies says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| let's cipher on this for a while, and maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| the law department or something can come up with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| the reasons why this might be in here, let it go tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| in two weeks' time maybe it needs to come out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| Three years of Tulane Law School and we get Jethro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I don't necessarily have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| It is only first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| We can pick this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| If there are people who feel like they do need time to cipher on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| I'm willing to give people that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| So the motion and second on the floor is to amend by omitting the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| signs language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| So what would you like to, you want to vote on that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| The second was by Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Would you withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Certainly if the first is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| We will withdraw for now is what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Back to the original motion as amended once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| I'd like, I'm batting a thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| like to discuss possibly amending it a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| I like Ms. Feld's idea about increasing the distance from 200 feet to 250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4706)|
| 1:18:33| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| It was, she at MPC did discuss increasing the length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| She just did discuss a greater number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| However, it doesn't, from the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| it doesn't look like a specific amount was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| But I don't know if folks have any feeling on possibly increasing the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| of the parcel of property, its frontage, to allow these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| Was that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| The motion would be to, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| in Part E commercial districts, E1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| it would change 200 feet to 250 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| and it would likewise apply to all corresponding parallel sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| like, for example, commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Second is to change language from 200 to 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| Did we ever find out what the length of the moratorium was or is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| Ninety days or until final action was taken here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| but we don't know when the 90 days start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| so it leaves us with a little bit of uncertainty as to the answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Did you say or until, which means we could take longer than 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| Is that how it was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| We think it was in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| so that would get us through June, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| Was the or until designed to give us more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| So it was 90 days or until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| It's the shorter of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Whichever is the shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Ms. Cassidy, do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Well, I was interested in that myself, and I looked it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| and I can tell you it's before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I believe it's like the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I was told that this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| So let me make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| It's going to expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| and then people can go and start pulling permits for these lickety split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| But, I mean, I don't know of any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| there's no way that we can extend the moratorium tonight because it hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| been put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| It's not on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| and I don't think you can add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| So is the only way that it could be addressed without the moratorium lapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| is by passing it on emergency tonight or with a special called meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| Either of those two could address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Mr. Hoeklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Well, one way to deal with that, and, as you know, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| I've never been a fan of special call meetings except for the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| In the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| In the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Would be to have a special call meeting immediately prior to the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| our upcoming workshop next week so we wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| But the 11th will be prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| It would be on Wednesday, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| It would be a day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Well, that's another discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| So that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| And I would like, you know, we may, I don't know what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| what council will want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| We may want to postpone the second reading on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| I'd like to explore a near ban, if not a total ban on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| I suppose that would mean requesting, not necessarily sending this back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| MPC, but starting the process again or sending this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| There are different ways of doing it, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| But I guess the first thing we need to do is decide what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| about this tonight and what's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| and figure out what to do about the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Well, there seem to be two questions on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| and one is relating to the moratorium and one is Mr. Frost's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| I actually have thoughts on both, so I'll just talk to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Surprise, surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| I guess at one level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Mr. Holquist's idea of a special call meeting before the workshop might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| actually be the best we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Potentially what we just hope is that nobody applies for anything on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Somebody will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| You know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| You know that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| I can guarantee you the minute the moratorium expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| there is one gentleman who will be waiting on our door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Is this person somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Now, the interesting part is because we're going to cover all the operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| qualifications are retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| Is this person somebody who is going to be impacted by the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| 200 and 250 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| I don't think the feet aren't going to impact him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| but he has been impacted severely by the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Well, the interesting part is, and Mr. Donaldson, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| one of the reasons that we're not paying that much attention to the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| is that all the things that are different in this ordinance are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| that you don't get grandfathered in if you don't hit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| So all the operational characteristics people have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| So we do sort of open up a little bit of a can of worms with moving the feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| But if it doesn't affect this guy, that one day might be what we end up living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| So, I mean, that's a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| And I don't know if we want to figure out what we're doing because it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| seem important if we're dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Tonight I need to make a motion that I just withdrew and get back to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| But let me just say on Mr. Frost's motion, the idea of increasing the footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| my recollection of when this was the original EMC ordinance was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| and I was not on the committee, was a very challenging event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| We did it on emergency and we made a lot of last-minute changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| And I'm wondering, did we change the footage requirement from what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| committee recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Because we had all that stuff with the Tennessee Theater that we had to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Did we change that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| But I can tell you that in committee it was discussed at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| It started out at over 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| And there was several discussions on the length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| And finally it was decided that we all could live with the 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| I would like to call on Mr. Swanson who has a solution, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Well, I have a suggestion that you might want to consider as to how to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| And I know that there certainly is a philosophic problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| and a reasonable philosophic problem with the concept of emergency legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| But because of the dilemma that you face with regard to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| it seems to me that a reasonable approach to this might be to decide how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| want to pass this on first reading, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| Pass it in that fashion on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| and then instruct the city recorder to put this back on the agenda for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| motion to reconsider at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| So you know it's going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| I know you're going to discuss it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| If you want to do something different on a motion to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| you can do something different on a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| But that will get you by the problem of an expiration of the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| if you want to do it in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Would anybody like to comment to that suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| I see some other lights, but anybody to that suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I just want to make sure I understand, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| You're saying if we were to pass this on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| and then reconsider it, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| to go through the regular process in sort of a backdoor manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| that would, in effect, extend the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| It doesn't really extend the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| The moratorium will cease by its own terms by virtue of you adopting an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| Again, I think understanding this will supersede the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| or the moratorium will go away and this will take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| so they will be allowed under the regulations embodied in this amended ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| In whatever way you decide to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Now, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Actually, go ahead to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| My comments may be for this whole process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| I think he wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| I believe, and that's actually a brilliant solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| I'm glad we gave you a raise a year or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| You've earned it finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Let me, my, Mr. Swanson, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Because we've said that all the operational characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| which are all the stuff as best I can tell that are changed in this up until Mr. Frost's amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| all those you do get grandfathered, you don't get grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| So the moratorium ends, somebody can set aside differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| but in three months they have to bring it up to this standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| So that, we only need to do what you're suggesting if Mr. Frost's amendment pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| So we should actually consider it because it's not really a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| until we've done something that the moratorium we can't fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| If you are considering more stringent and least stringent provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| include the more stringent tonight, for example, 250 rather than 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| because that's the more stringent standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| And then if you decide later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| if you decide after thinking about it that 200 is really the right number anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| then on your motion to reconsider, then somebody moves to amend it back to the 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Actually, that was a good suggestion from Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| and I'll give him credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| You know, and I guess I reflect back to comments I've heard from Councilman Becker many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| many times, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| And I'm kind of in that spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| and I kind of understand what he's meant a couple of times about how some things just don't feel right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| You know, I remember when we tackled this thing and passed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| and had to come back because we forgot the Tennessee Theater had the big sign that was about to be lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| You know, and we're sitting here right now, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| I think kind of piecemealing this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| And I'm really not even clear and a little uncomfortable about why we even bifurcated it to begin with from the other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| I know the NPC director's staff to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| So I've had a discomfort with regards to this, how we bifurcated this anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| and kind of addressing this now and we've, you know, left other issues out there to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| And I feel that we're sitting here today really making a lot of decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| making a lot of change, piecemealing this situation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| And it doesn't feel quite right, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| And so I'm not sure how I'm going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| I think we need to take some action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| But, you know, if I vote against this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| and I can now understand why we had two folks here who really spoke to the issue representing organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| but didn't take a position when we were in the other calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| It still doesn't feel like we've got, you know, this situation right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And I'm real concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I'm real concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| We're about to, you know, put some Band-Aids together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| and piecemeal some stuff together that we're going to be back looking at again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| I'm not very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| So I've got a real discomfort a little bit how we're going about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| and even talking with this tonight and this whole issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| So I know we've got to do something because the moratorium is passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| but I'm just real uncomfortable with even only just dealing with the operating regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| We've left some other issues out there that haven't been dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| And I've got a question with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| I've said that, you know, under each of the corresponding paragraphs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| dealing with the districts, you've got number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| And, Mr. Donaldson or either Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| someone tell me with regards to, like, for example, on the commercial districts, E2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| what two means or what's the effect of number two there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| about no EMC shall be erected or used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Somebody interpret that for me or tell me what that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| or what the practical effect is of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Not the intent, but what is the practical effect of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| At McDonald's, you see a lot of times at McDonald's those boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| like you go out and you put the letters up on and you spell the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Well, I understand that, but I mean the practical effect of how this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| And I understand if you've got one of those up, that's got to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| You're going to put an EMC up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| But can this be subject to a broader interpretation that could be actually used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| to prohibit EMCs in some instances or argument for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| Well, I'm just kind of looking at, you know, I'm reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| That sentence doesn't, you know, I know what it's trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| but does it say it the best way it needs to say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Well, I don't know if it says it in the ideal way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| It says what it says, and I think it says what it intends to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| Which is what, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| What do you as the MPC interpret that to be saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| To me that says that if you put up a sign that qualifies as an EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| you take down a sign that is defined as a reader board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| And if you don't have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| And if you don't have one, if it's a reader board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| And it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| And that's how we're interpreting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| We're still on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| Yeah, we are still on the amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| I want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| The amendment on the floor is the 250 to replace, change 200 to 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5544)|
| 1:32:33| On all its applicable instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Is that an old letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Sorry, it's an old letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| We're going to vote on the amendment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Now we're back to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| The motion is doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| We're going to go back to triply amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Since we're going to pass it on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| I'm going to make the amendment to delete the accept government owned sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| And, again, we can take it out if you're uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| You're removing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I'll re-second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| The motion on the floor is to remove the accept government signs exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I still have safety concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| and I understand, Mr. Becker, I heard you say that if it comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| then we can go back and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| But a safety emergency happens right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| It doesn't happen where you can go back and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| And so I guess I'm going to err on the side of being conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| I understand good for the goose, good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| I understand that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| But I'm going to stick with the government being exempt on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Well, I'm going to echo that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| Well, I'm going to, well, wait on being called on, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Well, I'm going to, you know, I think what this is about is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| that sign at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| And it's a sign everybody, when we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| or we don't allow digital billboards, everybody points at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| Well, you all do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| And I think this is one of those where the city is specifically saying we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| going to do something different than what we're allowing every other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| commercial establishment to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| And I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| If this was, you know, yes, if this said any signs except city signs in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| emergency, I could live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| But I think this is just about we want the right to do things that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| think anybody else should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| I think it's the wrong way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| It sends the wrong message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| If flashing signs are dangerous, flashing signs are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| And we shouldn't be allowed to do them because we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And this allows them to do them just because we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Let me just give one quick little update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| And I don't want to lose that thought, but there is some new information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| The moratorium expires midnight after our next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| You got interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| It expires on midnight of June 17th, which is your next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| There were two 90-day extensions initially passed on December 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| so it runs through June the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| So we'd have to get through before midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| As long as you all finish before midnight, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And we could pass it upon immediate effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| You would have to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| My comments now may not be pertinent anymore based on that new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| I was going to say, in response to Councilman Marotti's comment about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| safety issue, is that if we were going to revisit it in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| what are the chances of us having to put a safety-related message on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| convention center signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| and is that even possible that that would happen in the next two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| My guess is that that's probably out of the question anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| But now that it's a moot point, I'll withdraw my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| Well, no, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| The amendment that's on the third amendment, which is on the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| involves removing the accept government-owned sign language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| We'll voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| That's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| That's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Councilman Holtquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Was that an aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Councilman Whithall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| The motion fails two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Now we're back to the motion as doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Ms. Cash, I have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Under the regulations, let's see, commercial districts, E, small letter E, number eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| I'll read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| It says an EMC must be equipped with a dimming sensor switch that automatically calculates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| lighting and adjusts itself accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| And there were some questions raised earlier tonight that this clause does not specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| a baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| In other words, what are we dimming, what's the reference that we're dimming against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| What, we do not require dimming sensors at this point, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Could you tell, could you educate me more about this and how this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| And again, if you feel it's been effective or if you feel some more specific language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| might be helpful in your interpretation and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| Not trying to be smart, but we require dimming sensors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| Are they used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| We've never had a complaint that they're too bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| If you recall, Councilman Roddy, this is one of the issues that we discussed at that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| This is also one of the big issues that was discussed at the digital billboard advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| committee and at all the digital billboard public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| We would prefer, and it was suggested by the advisory committee that did work on the digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| billboards, that a standard be set and that the companies be required to provide the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| the instrumentation to measure that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| That's my question, and I ask not because I didn't know that we hadn't covered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| but it was brought up tonight by some folks that came to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| and I know there's just been some confusion about how do you go out and measure lumens in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| and how do you know whether or not a sign is complying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| And I'm just concerned that this particular clause is vague and maybe, while I can understand the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| there, may be difficult for your department to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| The way it is written now and the way it is proposed to be written, it is virtually unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| Well, I don't think we should try to pass something that's unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| Do you have a suggestion in terms of what might be better language that would be easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| for your department to enforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| If you'll give me just a few minutes, I could get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| This is first reading now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Any other comments at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| I have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Another question was raised this evening by folks about limiting colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| and that was not something that the study committee took on initially a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| So if you look at the very first page of this ordinance under A, general regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| number three says that no signs except EMCs shall have red, green, yellow, amber, or blue lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| So I read that to state that an electronic mission center can have all the colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| and it was raised tonight a concern that the colors be limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| Is that correct, Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| A number of years ago, and I can't give you the exact year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| I can tell you what sign it came about as a result of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| When the city of Knoxville looked into first originally to putting the EMC at the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| the ordinance prior to that time did not allow any colored lights like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| They were all prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| And prior to the city getting the permit and installing that sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| the ordinance was changed to allow the colored lights only on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| And when we did the study committee, I know we went round and round about should we only allow red lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| or should we allow the full spectrum of colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| and I believe the consensus of the study committee finally was that this technology is improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| and to allow only the signs with the red lights was to really limit folks that were putting up these signs to older technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6077)|
| 1:41:25| and that perhaps if we were going to allow electronic message centers that they would be cleaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| and nicer looking to allow for technology to improve, in other words, rather than limiting to just the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| But it was brought up by a participant in the meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| so I wanted to bring it up with this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Is there interest in revisiting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Are we comfortable with this full spectrum of colors that are allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| And I'll toss that out for discussion while Ms. Cash works on the measuring lumens question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| Any response to Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| Mr. Hawkless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Well, again, going back to Ms. Cash working on answering those questions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| I don't know if she needs to or not since this would be first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| but as far as the colors go, the thing about electronic displays like this is that you have an infinite number of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6126)|
| 1:42:16| in color range just like you do with essentially close to what you do with a computer display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| The technology is close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| So just because the technology allows something doesn't mean we should automatically allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6144)|
| 1:42:34| I just think we have to decide what we're trying to accomplish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| The broader the range of colors, the more realistic the image is, the more alluring the image is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| It just depends on what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| If you say they have to be monocolor or monochrome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| then you're probably restricting them much more to text kind of messages and very simple messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| versus messages where you show a box of detergent or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| And we just have to decide what it is we want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| And Councilwoman Pelo and Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| you'll remember that that very same type of message center is exactly what started that first task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6194)|
| 1:43:25| It is indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| And I'll have to say it was not something we just decided out of the air or within our own minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6206)|
| 1:43:34| but it was we studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| We went and experienced a display of the colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| We heard the technology discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| And, you know, that was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| To me, it's time because I knew nothing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| And so it wasn't just a decision somebody made about colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| but it was really based on the information that we had at the time, which I guess was four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| And so I was going to say didn't have to just make those decisions out of the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| but based it on actual viewing of the technology, which was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| I guess, Ms. Roddy, my question would be one for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| When we did Mr. Frost's proposal, he specifically said NPC considered a higher distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| And I guess the question, because this is a zoning regulation and we can only consider what NPC is considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| can we change any of the language on the color of the lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| Because that wasn't a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| As best I can do, that didn't seem to be part of what NPC considered in their amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| Unless the record reflects that there was some consideration of those colors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| I would suggest to you that that's probably a substantive change that might require a re-referral to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| The language that Ms. Cash is working on right now would simply be clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| as was some earlier language was a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| And the 250 was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Well, they didn't talk about 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| They talked about greater distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Clearly they talked about that distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| So while that might be something that's well worth considering, Ms. Roddy, I don't know that we can today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| Mr. Hoppus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Based on what Mr. Swanson just said, it makes me think that we may or may not all be satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| with what we can do with this in first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| given the constraints in what NPC is considered and what NPC is not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| But we are now in a position, we know, that we could extend the moratorium if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| for further consideration, for sending it back to NPC, whatever we feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I'd like to call on Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| One thing I did want to ask you about, and if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| you voted just a few minutes ago to amend the 200 feet requirement to 250 feet requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| and would like to direct Ms. Poplin's attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| I think she was gone to get the date for that moratorium, and I believe that would have some effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| would it not, on the schedule for the amortization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| or would that be considered something that you would want everyone to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| On the distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| That's not an operational requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| That just goes to the actual operation of the message on the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| So any new one would have to comply with the 250, but the old ones would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Bonnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| I guess I would ask that since we're going to hear this on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| if Ms. Cash or somebody from the law department could come back with some language that's more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| regarding measuring lumens, unless you feel like you're ready tonight to propose something that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| I would like to tighten up that language before we pass this on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| We'll work on that and get it to you in time before the next meeting so you'll have time to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| You said what you have here you don't feel like is enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| and I'd like it to be workable and enforceable for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Right now we're as amended twice, just for clarification purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| No other comments or are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Okay, we're voting on this amendment as amended twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| Voting, so this is now the official vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| This is now the official vote, first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| It's not emergency, it's first reading of two on the ordinance as amended twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Let me just say very quickly, for the reasons I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| I'm comfortable with kind of watching how we prepared this meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| and I'm not so sure that it's palatable enough for me at this juncture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| so I will probably be voting no tonight with regards to kind of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| I think we can tell by the comments and the additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| and the discussions and the back and forth that this is just not quite right just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| and I don't feel it's a very important piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| and affects not only what's in front of us with the electronic messengers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| but I think it also sets standards for other issues in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| I just want to make sure that I'm real comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| I'm not quite comfortable enough yet, even though it is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Now we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| I think I heard eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6521)|

| 1:53:12| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Just a couple of questions with regards to it and maybe just over reading here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| On page 5, I'm not sure who can address this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| Chief Gas can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| On page 5, I think in paragraph 3, paragraph 4A, 4B, and also, I guess, the paragraph below 4B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6808)|
| 1:53:42| we interchangeably say, like, for example, in paragraph open paren 3, close paren 3, on line 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| starting with the carry, custody, or control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| Throughout that page, we use or sometimes, or control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| Sometimes we use and control, which are two different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| And then sometimes we use and control, or control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| So I want to know if there's a difference there or do we need to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| When you add an and, that means we need all three together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| When you add an or, you can have any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| And so that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| Sandy, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| I think you probably really want an and there pretty consistently is what you really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| So the vehicle has to be in the carry, custody, and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| Is that what we think we want there, Mr. Prosser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| I would have thought or, but I got Mr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| Well, I'll tell you, these changes were made to comport with the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| I thought the state law probably read like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| We've had this issue before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| But there are two different things, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| There's two very different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| But I'll take a look at that and see which one it needs to be since this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| And I'll take care of all that and report back to you the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| And then on page four, it talks about, and maybe take a look at this too when you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| We just kind of probably bought this right out of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| Line two on, I guess, B2 on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| It talks about a citation or warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| That's the only place in the whole legislation that it talks about citation or warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6917)|
| 1:55:24| and states something should happen with either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| And, you know, I guess the question becomes with regards to the warning, when does a mere warning, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6927)|
| 1:55:35| when is a mere warning merited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| We talk about citations throughout the whole piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| And all of a sudden we talk about a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| When does that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Because someone's going to ask kind of how that generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| So maybe we can look at that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| I'll prepare a comparison for the state law and report back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| It should be fair notice to the citizens that when they elect attorneys to counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| this is the kind of discussion we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080603?start=6957)|
