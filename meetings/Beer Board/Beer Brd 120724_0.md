| 0:08:24| So tell us a little bit about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=504)|

| 0:08:30| and that is for the Dirty Governors CD release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Thank you to Knoxville for supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| They have become one of the, if not the number one band right now in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| So they're getting really well-known nationwide, and as an appreciation of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| they asked us to help them put on a free concert on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| So that's April 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| And then the rainout date for that I think is September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=536)|

| 0:09:00| and that's one of those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| And then the other ones are October 6th and October 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| and that's an Oktoberfest celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| We want to celebrate the month of October in the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| and then on October 27th we're going to concentrate on a really well-known local musician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| Phil Pollard, who passed away last year right before his birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=562)|

| 0:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| So we wanted to celebrate music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| and all the music that he brought to Knoxville for an Oktoberfest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=570)|

| 0:10:44| or what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Yeah, it's just changing corporate owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| The management is still going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| The next one is the Silver Spoon Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Is it withdrawn or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| It seems like they've withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| I need to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| No, that was the safe way that we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| The Silver Spoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Do we have anything from them or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| We don't have the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Do you want to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Do you want to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Well, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Let's find out a little bit about the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| What went on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Well, they've moved to a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| I know, but on July 6th, per an urgent email request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| if you can tell us a little bit about what they asked for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| Well, it's kind of like I guess I just put in your packets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| They called me trying to urgently get on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| And I've done this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| They just faxed me the top copy of their beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| That gives me the information I need for the public notice in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And I did that with the understanding they were going to come in the office Monday with the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| pay all the fees, and I haven't seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| They haven't paid any fees or anything yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Not a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| So does this mean it's really not official at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| It means it's not really an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| So it really means that if we don't do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| then they just come and submit and ask for an application, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Vice Mayor, it appears that we did bend over backwards to help these folks, and they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| And so I think we just do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| All those in favor of doing nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you look perplexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| They haven't paid their fees or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I don't really have an application yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| All we have is page one of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Well, then we have no application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Next is the Summer Soul Jam, and that is on August the 18th at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Sharon Upshaw, 3924 Kenilworth Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Tell us about the Summer Soul Jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| This will be our second year, and we're very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I know the last time one of the commissioners asked for a do-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| so we went a little different, got as close as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| But we tried to put on an event for adults in the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| It was a success last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| And this time we bring in three different bands from the legendary funk and soul era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| and we're going to have the Bar-Kays, Confunction, and Lakeside in our World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Who are the groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Confunction, the Bar-Kays, and Lakeside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| You know those, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| He's older and can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| The Bar-Kays, I know you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| File's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Well, before I move to approve, I attended it last year, and you had an adult comedian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| and I got a lot of complaints about the language that was used by that particular comedian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| And if you're going to have an adult show, you need to let people know what kind of show it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| because a lot of people brought their children, and the language that was used was really way over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=874)|
| 0:14:43| So I hope that you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| If you're going to have him back, I hope that you will let people know that before they come with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| Because I got a lot of complaints about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I did as well, and no, sir, he is not invited back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| And I had a very stern conversation with him, so that will not be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| It was not acceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| We had a lot of people from the community as well as yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Judge Rawson came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Some of the mayor-elects came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| So I was very, very upset with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| It was really embarrassing, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| It really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I'm going to certainly move to approve and hope that you'll have a successful show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Bands only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Bands only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=934)|

| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| We have a music show this year, so that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| The next one is Zoe's Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| This is in District 2 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Move to transfer this to District 1, isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Is he close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| My name is Dawson Magoo, and we're 6638 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Ms. Barton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Call is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Counselman Greene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Could you tell us a little bit about your restaurant before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| We're Mediterranean-inspired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| We have kind of like an American twist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| We serve a lot of salads, kebabs, chicken salad, pimento cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Everything is made from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| We don't have any microwaves or fryers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| We have both small freezers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| So everything is made from scratch every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| It's fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| It's good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| It's tasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Simple, tasty, fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=988)|

| 0:16:30| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| You better act on this pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Who's counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Is that an old light, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Do we have the approvals yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| It doesn't look like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1010)|

| 0:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Did anybody from Dollar General come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Well, we're not to the end of the meeting yet, so we'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We have some places on our agenda that have some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| and the first one is Deli Rays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| Deli Rays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| My name is Mike Kirkland, 7337 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| This was originally on the docket in April, 98 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| so we've had the records checked, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| What are we waiting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| We're just waiting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Well, we're refurbishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| It's on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| It's a new deli coming to Chapman Highway in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| and we're just putting new equipment in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and the owners are putting new central heat and airs in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| so we're just about two or three months away from finishing all of the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| So no problems except just the delay of refurbishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| And so what kind of an extension are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| I'd say another good two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| I've got them out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Ninety days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| So October the 16th would give them 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| I'll make a motion to extend this until such time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Work hard, and we'll see you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| We won't see you if you get done and pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| The next one is El Burro Loco, Mexican restaurant and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Crazy meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Crazy burro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I'm Chris Hernandez, 87th and 9th Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| And this is also one that was originally applied in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| The records have been checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Tell me about what are we waiting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Well, we're refurbishing also, and it's just me and my partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| We've been doing most of the job ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| But with our other jobs, we've been taking forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| That and equipment has been wrong, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| What kind of a target opening date are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| We hope early September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So we have a beer board meeting on September the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| Do you think that you would have it done by that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| This would be in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| What is that, a 90-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| A 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| A 60-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| We approve a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1189)|

| 0:20:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Oh, we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| We need to vote on the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| I didn't hear any clamoring not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| All those in favor of the extension to September 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1211)|

| 0:20:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| The next one is the Icon Ultra Lounge, which is going to be in the Sun Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1221)|

| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1228)|

| 0:20:32| Mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| And it's just a matter of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| The Sun Sphere is such a unique building that you can't understand some of the obstacles that we've come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| But we're working through all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| The city's been great, very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| PBA's been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We just need some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| August 21st is our next beer board meeting, September 18th after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Do you think you will actually be ready by August 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I hope so, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| But if we could have until September, that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I brought you guys some photographs to show you how far we've come since April, if you'd like to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Well, that would be fine also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| But September 18th would give you plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And as always, when you get everything finished, you can take the final things, pick up your permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| and then we will just not see you again here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I hope to see you all on the Sun Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| But not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1286)|

| 0:21:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1291)|

| 0:21:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1311)|

| 0:22:14| It's a complete remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We've got two full-service bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| We're going to have small plates, international tastings from around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Our menu is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Handcrafted cocktails, something special, not something you can get everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| The view is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| You know, if you're in Knoxville, you've got to love the Sun Sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1357)|

| 0:22:55| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1375)|

| 0:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| The next is Rogers Place on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| My name is Chris Patrick, and it's 8817 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And tell us what the issues are with Roger and not being finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| Well, ma'am, the owner, right after he came through the meeting, he had back surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and then after he got up through his back surgery, he had open heart surgery within the last seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| So in our fire marshal, we were waiting on some things with our fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| He came in Friday night and noticed that our sprinkler system was done wrong over our venue of our music area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| which has been that way for the last eight or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| That was Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| So we called Morristown Sprinkler on Monday, and they can't get there until next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| So that's basically what we're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| And I have the charter and everything else with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| So August the 21st, do you think that you'll be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| We give the extension for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1438)|

| 0:24:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| And good luck with the owner's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| The next is Vick's Beer Store and Cigar Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1448)|
| 0:24:19| Garrett Jernigan, 102 Sequoia Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Could you tell us why you're not up and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Just construction delays, and we're requesting 60 days extension, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| So you think by September the 18th you'll be ready to open for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| This is in my district, so I move that we grant his wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| And once again, if you are ready before September the 18th, you pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Now, we have ‑‑ I've always had that princess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| We now have some other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Did anyone from Dollar General come in at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| We have a new state law that impacts us, and I believe that Mr. Frost is going to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| with us ‑‑ what was your ‑‑ what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Trader Joe's is ‑‑ they've picked ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Requirements, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| I thought we had an e‑mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I sent an e‑mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| But they're in ‑‑ they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| They're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Now, Mr. Frost, would you share with us the new state law, and you were gracious enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| to send us all a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| I, in the law department, became aware of this when, if you all recall a number of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| ago, Hannah's on Cumberland Avenue had some pretty serious serving underage people situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| and 40‑something citations were issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Well, they got in trouble with the state and the state ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| What the state ABC did under this law, they have suspended the liquor permit for Hannah's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1571)|
| 0:26:21| Cafe on Cumberland Avenue for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| The new state law provides that if the state ABC goes through certain steps, sending out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| the notice via certified mail to local cities, because this does not apply to every city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| and county in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| This is a statewide project that's scheduled to go until July 1st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| Then local beer boards can take into account how the ABC permit got suspended or revoked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1605)|
| 0:26:56| as the case may be, and allow local beer boards to either suspend or revoke the beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| in a period of time that would match what the state ABC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| And also, this state law, it's reciprocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| If a local beer board suspends or revokes a beer permit, if the local government takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| the proper steps to notify the state ABC, the state ABC can rely on what happened at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| the beer board and how the local permit got revoked in revoking the state liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1648)|
| 0:27:43| Next week, I believe, August 1st, beer board chair Palmer, I, and Allison Ebertine in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| law department, who works with alcohol issues for the administration, we are all going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| be meeting to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| Probably an issue arises that I believe the Hanna's violation, which led to their suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| was before this law went into effect, and, therefore, there's a chance that this reciprocal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| suspension might not come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| But we're going to meet about that and talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Another issue, the sponsors of the new law are surely well-intentioned, but the way it's crafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| as you all know, you all sitting as the beer board do not actually suspend or revoke beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| You send them on to the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| The way the statute is crafted, it's as if it's this body that suspends or revokes the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1725)|
| 0:28:55| So we're going to, in our meeting, we're going to discuss how we can address that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Let me add a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| This legislation came about from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| And, apparently, their beer board and their TABC folks work hand in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| and there were some people who were shifting licenses and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and so there was a feeling that they were skirting the intent of punishments for violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| And that's how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| So Knoxville and Nashville are really the biggest cities that are addressing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| But how their beer board handles these issues and how ours handle them are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Now, Sergeant Hunter, am I correct that you and TABC work together on these compliance checks for on-premise locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1780)|
| 0:29:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| So if there was, in the case of Hannah's, our beer board was there as well as the TABC folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| And so the number of citations that were issued was for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| So your question covered the whole spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Now, we are supposed to, according to this, get a certified letter from TABC telling us this whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| And so far we have some e-mails, but we don't have the certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| And so we're waiting for the certified letter so that we can move into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| But as we speak, Hannah's liquor license on Cumberland has been suspended for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| Their beer license is still active until we act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| And that's part of the discussion on August the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| I see a number of lights, and I didn't see which one came first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| So we'll start with Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I'd like to know the circumstances around that many citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| I'd have to get with ABC to see what the total, what the documentation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1858)|
| 0:31:06| and the totality that they used to give them a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| I do know some of the paperwork that they used were copies of citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| that the National Police Department had written at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| For instance, there was a night, January of 2012, where 45 people were cited for underage consumption in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| Two more were arrested for underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| There was another night in December of 2011 where they were cited for sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| and that was their second sale in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| So help me, is cumulative that many, or are you talking about one evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| Yes, one evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Yes, 45 citations and two arrests for underage consumption in one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| You made a mistake reading the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Did what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And that was, what was the date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| I'd have to double check to be sure, but I believe it was January 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Well, I mean, this board has the authority to move that to an automatic revocation and suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| Does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I would think so, particularly this other one, because you look at a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and if you have two or more in a two-year period, you can come to this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| and three you can get shipped off, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| But at any point in the process, we can bypass that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and take it immediately to a revocation and suspension hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Yes, I would think. I can double check. I'll confer with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I feel pretty confident that I'm right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I want to hear what everybody else is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| but I'm certainly leaning towards that action this evening, and I'll say that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Just by way, I happened to print out today our process for citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| and according to the process, the first citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| it's a $250 fee to the police department or submitting a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| The second citation is an administrative hearing, $500 fine, a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| or we can have suspension or revocation, or we can take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| And a third citation is much more serious with a suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| But I still think that we need to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Well, I still think that any time during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| we can take it to a revocation and suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Councilman DeLaveau, I believe you were next, and then Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| I gather what Councilman Pavlis is saying is that that's a pretty gross violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| It seems like there was no system in place whatsoever to screen these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| or they just turned their back to have 45 in one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| It may be an example needs to be made for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| With regard to the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| it strikes me that if we're reacting to what the Liquor License Board did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| we should probably issue something like an order to show cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| why their license shouldn't be suspended under this new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| and give them a chance to give a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| They get to have their hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| They will have their hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| They have to be given the statute provides for a minimum of 14-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| So they get their notice and they get an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| They get an opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| It's not a unilateral yanking without a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| And the second question I guess that someone should look at, maybe it's you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| but if the statute technically says this body must do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| we should probably adopt some kind of a resolution delegating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| or empowering that hearing board to do that on our behalf or something so that we can touch the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| That's part of the reason for our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| It sounds like we would need some kind of formal delegation so it's clear that they're acting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| And that's part of what we will talk about on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| And then the next beer board is August, what was it, the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| And so I would anticipate that Hannah's will be with us on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Counselman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| You mean the state, the alcoholic board can come in and issue permits for underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, how do they know if they're drinking liquor or beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Well, they go on the compliance check with Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| So can you get cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Can you get cited for, it sounds like you can get cited for underage consumption for drinking liquor by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| But, I mean, how do we, I don't understand how it's separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Well, Sergeant Hunter, you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I'm sorry, I missed part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I was just trying to get some clarification on how, you know, if someone is in a bar and they're served a drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| I mean, who looks to see whether it's beer or whether it's hard alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| I mean, how is the citation issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| Typically, as in the case that happened in January, officers noticed how overcrowded the bar seemed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| They went into it, saw that some of the patrons seemed to be underage, started checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| And if you can, if you notice an odor of an alcoholic beverage about their breath in person, I mean, you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| we'll typically ask them what they've been doing, if they've been drinking, if they've had anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| But as long as you smell that alcohol, it doesn't matter if it's liquor or if it's beer, it's underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Those citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| It's the city that does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| The state doesn't have somebody that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| The city is the one that does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Now, the state also has someone come with you, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| When we're doing the underage compliance checks, we do always have an ABC agent with us on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| On that night in question where they just did, it was just patrol officers that noticed this and took action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| What we do on situations like those, we get copies of all the citations or arrests that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| and if it's a liquor license establishment, we provide copies to the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| and then they take it, conduct an investigation, and they take action on their side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| And so in this particular case, the state went ahead and revoked the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Suspended it for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Big difference if you're Hanna's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| And why did we not take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| We have not had the notification from the state of their action, and we don't have the authority at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| That's what I wanted to get clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| We don't have the authority to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| I was contacted by the executive director for the state ABC saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| did you know we just reached an agreement with Hanna's that their liquor license was going to be suspended for 45 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| And I said, no, I hadn't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| And he said, well, let me send you via e-mail the order we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| There's going to be a revised order coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| And I said, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And they asked me for who was chair of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| and I provided them the chairman's address because the state statute requires to start the time running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| They have to send it certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| That's one of the things you've got to check on your list of things to do in going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| And they contacted me last week asking if anybody had received the final order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| and I checked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Nobody had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| So I re-sent them the address again and politely said to them, please send it certified mail so we can get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| if we're able to have this statute apply, let's get that taken care of so we don't get hung up on a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| So we're waiting and we're going to be, Ms. Eberting is on vacation right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| but we're meeting August 1st to discuss this very topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| But they, as far as the state's concerned, they are under suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Their liquor license is under suspension for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I think it started July the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| They can serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| They can serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Now, just to look down the road a little bit, should we suspend their license to serve beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| that could start at the time that their suspension for liquor ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| So I think the intent, and I knew a little bit about this when it was being created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| the intent was that places that sell to underage drinkers would get hit with liquor sales and beer sales both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| and it would really hit them in the pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| This was the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| And so, as with anything new, ducks are not in any kind of a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| And so it's a process of getting the process in a more orderly way to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| Vice Mayor Patlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Yeah, is this, how long is the, do you know how long the current ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| or management has been in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| I know that there's been a lot of occasions that they've been before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and there's been a lot of citations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| I don't know if it's under current management or if it's been a whole series of management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| which is not uncommon on the strip area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| As far as I know, the owner's been the same as long as I've been with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| That's about 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| I just, you know, part of me wants to wait and hear what's going to happen with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| but I just think that this is just too, it's just gross negligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| I mean, it's just completely out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| And I think that this board has a, there's no doubt we've got the responsibility to act on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| And, Attorney Frost, I mean, I don't want to be out of order or in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| but I really, from just my years of being on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| think that we have the ability this evening to send them directly to a revocation suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| Well, kind of alluding to what Councilman De La Vope said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| I'm afraid that they'd have to get some sort of notice that they'd be taken up in a manner like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| because they might need to have the ability to come and say their piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| even though 40-something citations sure as heck does not look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| But perhaps what we need to do is confer with the law director here shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| and see what things can be done because when it comes to putting on the case for the suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| it's the law department that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Do they get to continue to serve while this is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| Sure they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| I just, I don't think that, I'm just pretty sure that that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| But we can stay in session until Mr. Swanson gets here, which will probably be, I mean, we could adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2528)|
| 0:42:20| Could we recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| And then come back when he gets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| But before we do that, we still have a couple of other things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| This is not the end of the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| So let's hold this until Mr. Swanson gets here and get him to weigh in on what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| If I'm not needed, I'll go up to the law department right now and try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| That'd be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Run the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Use the phone or Pony Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Did you have a question, a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| So we will take this back up when we have Mr. Swanson aboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Looking on down the road here, we had an underage sale, I mean, a sale to a minor at a business on Lonas Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2582)|
| 0:43:13| and the person who made the sale was also underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2593)|
| 0:43:21| At least one and probably more than one member of the beer board has been quite disturbed by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| So I would like to have that business, if it's with the permission of the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| come to the August meeting and explain to us why they had an underage person selling the alcohol, the beer, to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| and what they're going to do to see that that never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Were they cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Wouldn't they come anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| No, because it was the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| And the first offense, because I looked it up today to be real sure I knew exactly how this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| The first offense, one of two things happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| You either pay a $250 fee or you submit a remedial plan to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Have they submitted a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Actually, the only time they get assessed the fee is if a noncompliance complaint is drawn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| if the remedial plan is late or is not turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| So as long as they turn in the remedial plan on time, they're not fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| That's the end of it for the first sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Have they turned in a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Could you e-mail that to us tomorrow so that we'll kind of have a heads up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| But I still, if I could get a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I'll move that we ask that they come and appear before us and explain their conduct and their plan of remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Was there an arrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Wasn't they arrested also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| The juvenile that actually sold the beer, she didn't have any ID, so we did take her to juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| She was arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| The owner, we went back the following week when the owner was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and we cited the owner for allowing a minor to sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| And we actually had the hearing in city court yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| She was found guilty and placed on probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| but her defense was that she wasn't there at the store at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| The 17-year-old was the daughter of an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| One of the other employees called in sick, so she brought her 17-year-old daughter in to assist her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| And the owner didn't know that the 17-year-old was working that day at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| What's the name of the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Lorena's Mexican Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| It's on Lowness just east of Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| It's been several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| That's the current incarnation at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Are we done with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I was going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| So I will be asking them to come to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| We don't need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| I'll just send them a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| But if you'll feel better, we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| No, I mean you had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Well, then, we had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| All those in favor of having the owner of Lorena's come and explain why this will never happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| They'll be at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| We have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Well, let's wait, if I could, wait until Attorney Frost gets back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| I think he's looking for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| They missed each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| But, you know, I want to say, too, and just make, Madam Chair, I mean just for public consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| that the Chair also has the ability, with the consent of the law department and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| to do an immediate suspension of a license or a temporary revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| I don't know which it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Like an emergency kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Until the hearing can be held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| You suspend until the hearing can be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| So, I mean, Mr. Swanson confirmed that we can do what I was speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| but let's get the two legal folks here together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| And when we meet on August the 1st, I think that Mr. Swanson is going to be part of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| We will get all of these ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Something that bothers me is a long time between the offense and something being done by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| And I think that in the case of the new pilot program that we're dealing with with TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| that possibly contributed to some of the inaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| But are you saying, Nick, that she could go ahead and suspend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| The Chair, in conjunction with KPD and the law department, can do a temporary revocation and or suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| But Mr. Swanson confirmed that we can send this tonight immediately to a revocation and suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| How long does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| How long does the suspension or revocation hearing take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Well, no, we send it to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| If we decided tonight that that's what we wanted to happen, how long would it be before the hearing occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Probably Ms. Mitchell knows the answer to that question more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Well, when I get the paperwork from the law department, we would schedule it immediately depending on that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| I think we have to give them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| See, that's what I was asking, if we have to give them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| I mean, I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but I'm saying if she has the power to go ahead and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| you still have to give them the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| In other words, we've got a situation here where you have someone that really grossly offended the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| And if they still have 30 days, it's going to be longer than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| because it's going to take a couple of weeks to get the paperwork and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| All of that is true, but remember that the clock is running on their liquor sales at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2937)|
| 0:49:04| By the time the Beer Board acts, that would come after their liquor sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| and that would be about the time that students who are their clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| But they're still operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| They're still operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Probably selling more beer than liquor anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| To keep in mind, it has to be, I mean, the law department has to also be in agreement in KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| So, I mean, it's not just falling on the Madam Chair's shoulders to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Or we can support it by making a motion that she does that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| Well, I don't believe it would be in a motion form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| I mean, that would be the Chair's prerogative to pursue that or to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| I mean, I want to make the motion that we go ahead and send them to a revocation suspension hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| I mean, this Board needs to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| We can't just not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| And there's a time frame, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| We can't help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| But we've got to get something on the books to show that this is just not acceptable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| It is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Well, I second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| All those in favor of sending Hannah's Cumberland to a revocation suspension hearing say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120724?start=3010)|
