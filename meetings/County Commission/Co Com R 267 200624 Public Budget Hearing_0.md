| 0:00:48| My apologies. I apologize for starting a few minutes late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=48)|

| 0:00:57| So we did need to get the commissioners, and frankly some of our guests, a time for a quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| So before we go into our agenda, I'm going to ask the county clerk's office to call the meeting to order by taking a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=63)|

| 0:01:26| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| All right. Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| You've probably seen the agenda online for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| Briefly, we have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Then part two we'll have, if any county officials or department heads, there may be some follow-up questions from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:42| And then we'll follow that up with the initial discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| And then after that, there will be another special meeting called specifically to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| So this meeting right now is not the meeting we're going to be voting on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| This is a public forum, additional discussion time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| When this meeting is closed, we'll convene another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| And I'm guessing we're on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I'm going to look up there and we've got the thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| I know we had some technical challenges at the Finance Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| So first thing on the agenda is public forum, and I've got two citizens who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| The first is Mr. Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Mr. Shelton, if you're here, please approach the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| And you've got five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you, commissioners, for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| I'm here tonight not to argue the vote on the budget but to try to keep your minds open about the need for more money for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:46| I'm a volunteer with a group called Stop School Pushout, and we advocate to get rid of the disparities in educational outcome for black and brown students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=166)|
| 0:02:57| as well as special ed students in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| The school system identified that we have a problem there, and so the task is to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| The budget you vote for tonight is only part of the budget that our students and teachers need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| Before the pandemic, the county school system had put together a budget that was about $40 million more than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| The budget was full of positions that the teachers and the students needed for the kids to come closer to getting an excellent education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:37| The budget included additional social workers, restorative practice facilitators, more teachers, guidance counselors, school cultural facilitators, school nurses, teachers' aides, and mental health support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:55| It also included a raise for the teaching and the school staff that is still behind the national average in salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| We understand that the pandemic is taking its toll right now, but as things look better, however, there are money sources that Knox County can tap into if they feel the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=243)|
| 0:04:15| Whether it be stretching the surplus fund or raising property taxes that are totally inadequate to fund our school zone, there is money to be found to run our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=255)|
| 0:04:30| We are one of the wealthiest counties in the state, and yet behind Shelby, Davidson, and Hamilton counties in money spent on pupils, according to my figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:42| We fall behind several of the surrounding county school budgets in money spent on pupils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| We even fall below the state average of 8% by 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| This is nothing to be proud of in my mind, and I don't understand why we have settled for this for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| I speak to you hoping that the county mayor and you, the commissioners, will realize these needs are not optional to be put off another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=301)|
| 0:05:11| My wife and I live in the county, and we live on a modest retirement income, and there are many like us who are prepared to pay higher taxes on our property if it's needed for our pupils to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:26| It is well worth the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| We need you to find the money for our students and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| The next citizen who has requested to speak at public forum is Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| Keith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| Keith, if you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| Keith Lyon, president of Fraternal Order Police Volunteer Lodge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| I've come before you today to ask you to support Sheriff Tom Spangler's proposal for a bonus for the deputies of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| As we all know, the last few months have been hard on the county in general, but the Knox County Sheriff's Office didn't close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| And with some of the things they've had to do with the extra testing, their workload's increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| And then add to it, you know, the events of the past few weeks with the protests and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And keep in mind that these officers do not have the opportunity to work overtime, and salaries and benefits have been an issue for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:37| And also keep in mind COVID has not only affected the way they work, it's affected their families too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| A lot of these officers have to work out extra jobs to make a decent living to support their families and to support their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| Their income was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| They haven't had the extra jobs that they've had the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| A lot of their spouses lost jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| The little extra money would be very beneficial to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| It's not a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| We understand that this year the pay raise would be kind of impossible considering the effects of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| But a bonus that the Sheriff has proposed would show the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| that the government and the citizens of Knox County care about law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| If I could ask you anything, just keep in mind it's the families that's been affected by COVID also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| That includes the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| We usually have folks sign up to speak at a public forum, and we had two sign up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| So I do want to ask if there's anybody else in the audience who would also like to speak at public forum before we move on in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:57| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Okay. Next item is receive input from interested county officials and department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| So I'm going to open this up, number one, if any department officials or department heads would like to approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| Secondly, this is also another good time if a particular commissioner has a question for a particular department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| This is similar to what we did when we had our first public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| So I'll throw that out there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Are there any of our department heads that would like to come up and any points that you didn't make at our last public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| or anything that have come up in the last week or so that you might have a question or a follow up statement on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Do any of my fellow county commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| We'll move on to item number four, which is a discussion of the proposed Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| This is a, I'll throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| I know we have all had our heads down in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| We've just finished the finance committee meeting, which kind of in a way overlapped with a lot of budget discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| But do any of my fellow commissioners have any specific questions or related to department heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| I recognize Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| I realize this is a discussion about next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| But I think some discussions have been going on between the mayor's office, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| in regards to closing out this year and what Officer Lyon brought before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| So is this the appropriate time to have that conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| I think this would be a good time to have discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And then when we come to actual budget vote, in fact, I can't think of a better time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| We went through these first three things pretty darn fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| The bonus structure will come out of FY20 probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| And so I think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I don't know when, I guess, we can't vote on it in the budget meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| but we can have a discussion about it now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| That would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Sheriff, do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=609)|
| 0:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| So, Commissioner, I did have a discussion with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| And first of all, let me say that I can't fathom how hard it is to be a police officer right now in this current environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| So we do appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| And we do respect this for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And, of course, Sheriff Spangler has my personal respect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| So, you know, unfortunately, we are in a situation where our budget is extremely tight for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| But I have had conversations with Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| In FY21, the state had proposed $4 million going to Knox County as a discretionary type fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| That was up to 5.1, a little over 5.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| So I had a talk with Sheriff Spangler about a $750 bonus for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| But if we could hold off to November so that we can kind of see where everything is, we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| And that was the discussion that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| I mean, because the sheriff came up last week, I believe, and discussed a $1,500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| And I don't think there's anybody on this commission that don't agree with that, that the deputies deserve and need that bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| But we can't vote for something that's not there, money-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| So we have to present a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And I'm the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Of course we would like to do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| But the issue is looking at the revenue and ensuring that we can actually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And so there's four commissioners that won't be here in the middle of next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| So we can't, we won't have that say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| But I hope that the commissioners that are staying will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| And hopefully in this next budget we can have a resolution or something from this commission that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| November, if that state money comes through, that we got $750 per officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| And then also if revenues in December are reviewed and there's something there to retroarrays, I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| I think my office would be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I'm going to go in the order of the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I'll do my best to stay on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| I know Commissioner Gilleslight had come on, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| You're pointing, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| I think Beeler was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Actually, Commissioner Gilleslight came on early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I saw her light come on first, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| But I don't know if this is referencing the discussion that's currently on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| But I think because we are in the middle of a public discussion, we are now at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| And I know we just all come through finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| But would we need to take a look at just the general information, expense highlight, to talk about where Knox County is on the graphs that were submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So that people can understand what's in the amount in the general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| We are at the moment where the public needs to hear the general information and why we have to present a balanced budget and where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| Just a brief briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| How does this sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Because I know some folks here weren't at the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| You got a good point, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| But I know there was the discussion topic that came up from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| So if this is pleasing to you, which I think would be good for everybody, is I'll entertain some more discussion on this particular topic that is before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| Then we'll move into, and we may even call on Mr. Caldwell to do a big picture, a brief dive on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| if that would hit the points that you're mentioning, if I'm hearing you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| So that said, back on the subject that was brought up at hand, I've got Commissioner Beeler and Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| and Commissioner Carringer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| So I'll go with Beeler, Schoonmaker, then Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I just had a question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Chris, I'm sure you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I'm sure you've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| I just need a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| What's the total cost of the sheriff's requested $1,500 bonus versus the mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| In talking to Allison, we think the number for $1,500 is about $1.6 million when you include in all benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| So take half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I think I can do that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Commissioner Biggs, did you want to weigh in on this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| I'll get through it and get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| So Schoonmaker, Carringer, then Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| How many would qualify for the bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=901)|
| 0:15:26| Tom Spangler, 400 Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| The total would be 820.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| And Mr. Caldwell, on the $5.1 million, what actually is that classified and where is that coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| and when potentially would that be received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| So in your budget document, you will have – you could find where we had allocated 4.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| because you – just a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| If the state had said what had to happen was the county had to pass a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and you had to fill out an application, then the state would send the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| And if you didn't spend it, then you had to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| And they had a list of categories you could spend it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So we had the 4.1 allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Then we got that final number of 5.1, and they said you don't have to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| you don't have to do anything from the standpoint of getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| In theory, they're supposed to send it to us in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Like anything with the state, I'd like to have my hands on it before I disperse of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| And just to summarize, our thought process was 1.6 million for Chaud Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:47| 1.2 million for ADA remediation, 725,000 for half of the mobile – of a new mobile command center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:58| 583,000 for IT hardware fiber build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| Then when we got the news about the other million, which was last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| that's when the mayor wanted to – he wanted – he talked to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and wanted to do $750 bonus for the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and the remaining amount of that funding would go to cybersecurity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| which in this time, I think it needs to go to cybersecurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| So that's how we would break out the 5.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Okay. And after – if we received the money in July, when could that actually be paid out then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| I think what the mayor was saying probably – where it comes from is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| I think best to pay it out in November just for this standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| It's cash flow for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| We know that we get low in September and October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| so I think a good time to pay it out is around the Thanksgiving holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| It's good for the standpoint of timing for the holidays and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| We pay out longevity at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| and so then it gets us to where we're actually getting in tax revenue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Okay. And based on the money coming in, we would not have to do a budget resolution at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Correct. In this regard, we've got 4.1 programmed into the budget that we're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| The other million is not programmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| We could bring it at a later time, or we could amend that resolution tonight and make it for that total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| Whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| All right. Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| I'm sorry, Michelle. Go ahead, Mr. Kerr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| We're spread out, so I'm not seeing the lights quite as –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker asked one of my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| and that was going to be how many officers would be receiving the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| I particularly think that it should be our full-time officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| and those that have been through the state academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| I mean, those are the men and women that have been answering the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| and really putting their lives out there and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| And, you know, I think they deserve more than what Sheriff Spangler has even come down and asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| Our Knox County Sheriff's officers have been underpaid for a long, long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| And any city officer will tell you they cannot leave the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and come over as a Knox County Sheriff's officer because the pay is so poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| I've been on county commission for four years, and every year we talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and I say it every single year in every meeting I'm in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Knox County has got to take these men and women seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| We have got to make a commitment to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| And why should our city officers be paid so much more than our Knox County Sheriff's officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| That's something that just blows my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| I mean, there is a huge difference, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I'm not going to be here, and neither is Commissioner Anders and a couple of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| but I hope that the commissioners that are here and the new ones that will come on in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| that you will take it seriously and sit down with these men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| The Sheriff's officers do not have step pays like teachers and like our city officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| So they have got, we have got to make an investment in them more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| If we want our county to stay safe and if we want them to come when we need them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| and we never know the next time when we're going to need them or our families are going to need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| So I realize, I understand what our county mayor is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| and I hope that this commitment tonight that if the money comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| and that we can put the money there in November to these officers, I hope we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| I don't know a single officer that does not work two and three jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| And that we should be ashamed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| And they didn't get COVID-19 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| They were all out there still risking their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| And everybody knows where I stand with our officers because my dad worked part-time as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| And so it's very important to me, and I've been committed to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and they have the utmost of my respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| and I don't understand why people don't respect them this day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| And Knox County is going to have to, they're going to have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| They're going to have to invest in these men and women if we want to stay safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Because I don't know who would want to go right now into the academy with the way things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| So I just want to say to all of you all, thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| This isn't some political speech for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| You all have known, you've known ever since you've known me how much I support you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| But it is time, and I hope the papers, the news meeting, everybody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| it is time that Knox County takes care of our men and women that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| And that's really about, I mean, if the money's not there, the money's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| If the money's there in November, then I hope that it gets put in their pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| But that's really not what all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| If we would start doing the right thing and supporting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| then we'll get the best and we'll keep the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| So until we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1378)|
| 0:23:09| That might be my last to say, but I'm telling you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| it shows where the money goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And if we don't invest in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| then we're going to have the kind of county that just runs rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| I think it would be up to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I think we need to make sure that corrections, because they may not be state certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| but we need to make sure that they're in there, not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| because obviously they were in with the quarantine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| I just want to make sure that your statement was the sworn officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| but the corrections officers need to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Yeah, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| And they've probably been at the very height of all the danger, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| And they're way underpaid also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Was Commissioner Smith before me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| You know, you're hidden back there, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| So, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| Thanks, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Hey, so if we're going to amend this and obviously earmark the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| that's obviously something we're going to have to do next month, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| No, it can be done tonight in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| But what I'm saying is, is we tell it and then the resolution comes out next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| We would propose to amend the budget by a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| and include that money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| So we can just go ahead and amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| And then also there was something said about a certain percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Was that a step or what was that for December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| That was a review in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| If there is money, if revenues, and that's, can't put that in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| but if revenues are exceeding the conservative estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and there's money there for a countywide raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| that it be included into the, amended into the December budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| I think what was discussed was this one piece up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and then as we do close out and look at revenue for FY21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| if we're seeing anything that is positive, whether it be for a raise or a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| then we look at that time for all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Would that be retroactively back paying them or just from that point on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| If it's a bonus, it's just one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| No, I'm talking about for the percentage increase in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I don't know if there would be a percentage increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I think ultimately what we would prefer to do is keep it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| So it would be, I think it's preferable to do a one-time bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| if that revenue in 20 or 21 is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Since I've been on commission in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| I have supported the Sheriff's Department and his deputies to the best of the ability I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| I believe it includes 16% to 18% raises total during that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and also supported every way I could the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| So, you know, if we can do things, if money is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| I am all for helping our deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| That's a job that's a tough job that deserves everything we can for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| But at the same time, I'm worried that we're leaving out some other people in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| that have been truly on the front lines also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| You know, some of our lowest paid employees work in the solid waste facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and these people have been bombarded with everybody's spring cleaning during quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| and had to have a lot of interaction and done a lot of work with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Also, we have health employees that have been out there actually doing the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| I think we should also try to do something for them, if at all possible, if money is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| I just don't want to leave out some people that I think that are also deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I'd like to echo what Randy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Sheriff, where did you go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you, Sheriff, and all your officers for what you all do, your foot soldiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| Give us an update on how many of your numbers that you may be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| When's your next recruiting class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Have you got those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| How's the recruiting class looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So, if you'd give me a quick update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| What I can tell you that I know right off the top of my head is we have 30 positions open in our corrections side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| We have a class going on right now, I believe, of either 9 or 11, somewhere at that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| On our patrol side, I have right now currently 14, I believe it is, positions that are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:30| You say you have 9 in class now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| 9 in the corrections academy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Is that a normal number, high number, low number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Probably a low number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| I just want to get those numbers, and I know that we're down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| My wife said it best, there's no way I'd be an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| So, I appreciate you guys, and gals, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| When I say guys, I also mean gals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Appreciate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I just want to get those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Let me just add real quick, too, that I'm up here and will continue to advocate for that $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| I understand what commission has to do, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| I'm not going to stand up here and be blind to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| But if I didn't stand up here and fight for my guys and gals, there's no sense in me being up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| Just know that I'm here fighting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| I was actually going to ask the sheriff a question, but I think he just actually answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| I mean, we've all just been through the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| A lot of the people in the back of the room heard how bad our numbers were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| You know, back at the end of February, I was looking at the numbers for the county, and they looked great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| And I was thinking of all the different projects and personnel and everything that we could do to make Knox County better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| And, unfortunately, that all just caved in, and we still don't know what's going to be happening on October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1807)|
| 0:30:17| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I agree with Commissioner Carringer that, you know, our law enforcement personnel have done an outstanding job for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| and they continue to be there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| And I'm not trying to circumvent an agreement that Mayor Jacobs has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| but I'd like to see if there's any way possible that if we have additional sales tax revenue over and above our projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1837)|
| 0:30:47| that we look at that November time period to do a $1,000 bonus instead of the $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| But it'd have to be based on additional revenue coming in from sales tax instead of this $5.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1855)|
| 0:31:04| You know, we can look at anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I don't like to just pinpoint one revenue source because if the others are bad, then you're not really equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| I think basing it off total revenue, to me, is a more fiduciary way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| That would probably be better just from our standpoint as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| I think sales tax for us, too, and the general fund is so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| We talked about how April was better by, like, 30% than we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| That 30% for the general fund is like $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| So that doesn't get you a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| And so I think I would look at it more from the holistic picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| And I would also just please remind you all that this is a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| It's a working budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| So if there is more money, we can make those amendments, and we certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Commissioner Smith said, you know, the health department has just been working so hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| and many of our other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So, you know, it's just a matter of seeing if the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| But if it is, you know, we'd certainly like to have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| And Commissioner Biggs, then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Actually, I've got kind of a tough question for Sheriff Spangler, if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1947)|
| 0:32:37| When did you get him a seat up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Let me move the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I think he's got the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| You do know I have short legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| My question is, earlier we talked about other agencies and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| How many have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| I'm just wondering how many have left you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| How many have gone to other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Well, I'll give you this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Since July of 2019, I've had 86 people resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| Majority of those being corrections, but then patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| and then I believe it was 10 or 11 that retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Right now I've got six people who have turned in their notices to retire in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Is some of it due to the high dollar amount that's coming from Oak Ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| You know, I mentioned last week we've got one that's left to go to Bean Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Of course, that's a $3 an hour cut in pay for them, for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| But part of that is because it's just too much here in this area that he wanted to put up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| So, I mean, I can understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| and I know that we're all going to struggle within the law enforcement recruiting side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| but we're not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| We're going to still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Can I ask you, Sheriff, a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| I think you said 10 retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| That was 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| How many of those went to other agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| and how many of them, as I think Commissioner Bix was trying to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| is it just people saying, I can't take this anymore, it's not for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| The ones that are retiring now, those are the ones that are saying they've had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| But I mean of that 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Oh, of the 76?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| I couldn't give you a number of how many of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| It was for different reasons, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Pay was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| I mean, it's always going to be that way, but that was another reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2077)|

| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| You've got a follow-up related to that, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Yeah, I just wanted to ask, Sheriff, what does a correctional officer start out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2082)|
| 0:34:57| 34-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And really this conversation is not for you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| This conversation is for the mayor and the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| because we fund our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| We fund our priorities, and we are at the point in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| where we must stop this conservative funding of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| We have priorities that when we take a look at our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| at 94 schools and more than 60,000 children and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| and we cannot fully fund the priorities of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| We cannot fully fund the priorities for the safety and security measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| of the officers that are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| and we are here trying to balance a budget asking for funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| in the middle of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| It doesn't even have to be a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Four years ago when I sat here, I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| We must begin to make the real investment in this county we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| to fully fund the schools and the needs of those children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| who will become the generation of people that are going to be paying our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| But we continue to scrape by and not really want to fund our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| And we have to take a hard look at funding our priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| and making sure those priorities for our families, for our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| for our officers are met on the table so that we are not here scraping by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| At this point, we continue to scrape by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| What we want to say is it's a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| but it is part of what we must do in terms of some hard decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and leadership for this county in order to begin to really fund the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Knox County needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Commissioner Hill, Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I've got two quick questions for Sheriff Spangler, maybe for Ms. Rogers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and one of my colleagues probably can answer the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| When was the UOP closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| This doesn't have to be the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Approximately how many of the officers that would be getting this bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| are under the UOP and how many are not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| That are on the UOP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| I'm not sure how many alive I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| There's probably between 450 and 500 that are still on the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| So about half and half, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| And some of those on the UOP will not be getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| That's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Of the 800 and some officers that are getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| what would you think would be the breakdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| Like just ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| The majority of those officers that would get the bonus are on the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Mr. Caldwell, I've got a question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and this is a procedural that we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| When we get to the end of the budget line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| and we're looking at the tax collection, sales tax collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| or property tax collection, and we have a surplus that we've collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| we automatically, in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| go ahead and do that additional tax collection that we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| that it goes on their maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Like, say, what's on this line right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| it says that we had in 18 to 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| the budget was $484 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| and the budget for 19-20 was 512.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Now, we automatically put that additional tax collection into their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| which raised the maintenance of effort that we have to maintain each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| We have to do that for the sheriff's office also in maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| But when we raise the automatically with additional natural growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| sometimes, like what we hit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| we don't have the money to fund that maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| Is there ways that we can look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| that we don't have to give the natural growth tax on their budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| Do we have to give natural growth tax dollars to maintenance of effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| No, you do not have to give natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| But we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| We historically have, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So that natural growth money that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| that we could look at things where we could put it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| like, say, the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| some of that money to natural growth that we would have to pay bonuses for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| And like the sheriff's asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| he's asked for a bonus that doesn't reflect on the maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| that we have to do for the sheriff's office, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| There's a maintenance of effort in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I know there's a maintenance of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| but what I'm saying is this bonus he's asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| will not reflect on his maintenance of effort, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Is it actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Maintenance of effort on sheriff, is it actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Or is it budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| And the only reason why I'm asking this right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| he's not asking for us for long term to fund his sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| but we're automatically long term funding our school's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| with just going ahead and just flat giving that money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| And I understand what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| but when we run into a situation like we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| but this tax collection and this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| we really don't have the funds to do much of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Let me ask this, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Do you know what the increase or what the change on maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2470)|

| 0:41:21| The maintenance of effort on schools from 20 to 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| I haven't looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| I just looked at these past two years of what, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Negative 7.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Negative 7.6 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| But that comes from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| The state also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Maintenance of effort is local recurring revenue for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| It is not the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| It's local recurring revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| And it's based off budget, not based off actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| It's not based off that total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| Never has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2515)|

| 0:41:59| No, it's based off budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| It's not based off actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2520)|

| 0:42:06| It's based off budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| And that budget this year is down 7.6 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Because of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| That's all I was asking is sometimes it seems like it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| There's no extra there this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I know there's nothing there this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I'm not making that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| What I'm saying is, well, I know we need the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| This pandemic has caused a situation that we've never experienced before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| And we're not knowing how it's going to affect us any time in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Because it shows there's spikes coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| And other states might be shutting down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| And we just don't know, you know, our natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| We've been living on this natural growth so long that somewhere along the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| we're going to have to change the way we figure these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| When we do need money, we will have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And I'm not talking about spending we're any day money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Because this may be short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| And if it is short term, then fine, we can get by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| But if it's going to be long term, then we may have to look at spending many day funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I'm just saying there's some way that we've got to figure out to get the proper funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:22| to the right department that does a lot of things that we ask them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| like the sheriff's department that goes out every day and does things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and puts their life on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| I mean, how much is that worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| I don't argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Here's my point, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| There's going to be in any type of governmental budget ebbs and flows as the economy goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| This is a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| This is going to have an economic impact three to five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| This is not a short term impact on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| It's long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| And so we've got to plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And how do we plan for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| We've got to make cuts where necessary and try to live within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| I mean, it's not pleasant, but that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I'm just trying to figure out a way here in the future where we get to a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| We're not in the situation we're in now that we're saying they need it, but we can't give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| And I don't know if we can ask the public for any more than what we're getting from them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| because a lot of those people are hurting quite a bit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thanks, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Back to Commissioners Smith and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Chris, I'm going to try to attempt to follow up on Charles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| And I think what he may be getting confused about and maybe I'm confused about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| but when he refers to natural growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| that is budgeted dollars that go where the pennies are dedicated to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| And as those revenues increase, that naturally increases those budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| It's not that we are taking money and saying, oh, we've got this pile of money, we're going to throw it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| It's where it's directed to go by our policies and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| I agree, and I see what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| My point was if you look at this year, across the board, it was not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| And so what we could do, and I'm going to use schools as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| this is the only one that I know of use, is we are required to give them a certain amount of sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| and that can't go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| So they have to get that growth on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Natural growth, they get regardless, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| In theory, what we could do is come through and take away pennies on property tax and put them somewhere else, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| I'm not advocating for that, but in theory, yes, you can rebalance and not give natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| We look at growth in three areas the state requires, schools, engineering and public works, and sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:13| And we could, in any three instances, make it to where it's always flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| We could, but historically, we have let those entities get natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| You're saying that by manipulating the pennies on the property tax, we could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| That's what you'd have to do in schools' case because ultimately the ballot initiatives dictate sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2790)|
| 0:46:39| And so that's the way you would have to do it as it relates to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| When you get to engineering and to sheriffs, it's probably a little less complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Back to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| And is this number correct from FY20, 237,347 for our maintenance of efforts for schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2816)|
| 0:47:07| And it's down 7% over that, or are we roughly looking at about 272 million maintenance of effort for schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:17| Commissioner Gill, do you mind if I ask exactly where you're referencing those numbers for the benefit of the body so that we all be on the same page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| I just need him to reference the page for our maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I think if you go to page 25, okay, if you go to 25, and if I'm wrong, Ron can come and hit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| But if you look at general purpose school fund and the revenue, go from current property taxes down to other local revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:43| to me in FY21, if I can do math, that number is 261,676.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| 262.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| 261,676,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Last year it was 269,305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| So that's a decrease of 7,629,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| And you can do a percentage on that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| But that's what I show as maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Okay, so that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So in that maintenance of effort and the impact of that reflects the impact that our teachers are experiencing with no pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:19| And, again, we return to funding our priorities and the needs that our teachers and students are going to be looking at as the plan to reopen in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2899)|
| 0:48:33| And I cannot emphasize enough about 94 schools and 60,000 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| We're not talking about competing priorities for safety in our children and our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| We're talking about that our budget has to be balanced and we are not where we need to be because for the last four or eight years, we continue not to fund those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2925)|
| 0:48:57| So we're really going to have to have a critical look at how to serve the needs of our law enforcement and meet the needs of our students and teachers that are in these dedicated schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2937)|
| 0:49:09| Because I would assume in the middle of this pandemic, counseling, crisis management, and still trying to teach students something is going to have a considerable impact, not only on behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2949)|
| 0:49:24| The fact that they're going to still need to be learning something and really the support those families are going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-200624-public-budget-hearing?start=2964)|
