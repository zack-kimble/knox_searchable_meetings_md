| 0:00:00| We're going to go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=0)|
| 0:00:01| And what we have today is, this was obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1)|
| 0:00:05| a preordained meeting for the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=5)|
| 0:00:08| But with what we had this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| with the announcement between the mayor and the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=11)|
| 0:00:13| I will, if you all would like, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=13)|
| 0:00:17| can have the mayor come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=17)|
| 0:00:18| If you all have questions for Chris, does anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=18)|
| 0:00:21| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=21)|
| 0:00:22| I'd like for the mayor to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| Mr. Mayor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=24)|
| 0:00:26| And Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=26)|
| 0:00:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 379-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| That's the way they say it in Corrington, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| But I'm not from Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Brownlee, do you have a question for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Or do you just want to clap for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| Well, I'm happy to clap for him, because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| been on his back for about the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| So I'm very happy to be on his side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| and holding his arm as much as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| So, Mayor, would you tell us how this all came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| and what the end result is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Well, actually, Dr. McIntyre, we're back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| That's close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| No, I mean, you know, it hasn't come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| Is he violating the restraining order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| It hasn't come about yet, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| And I would remind everybody, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| remind our friends in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| especially those in the blue shirts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| that I think it's imperative that you talk to your folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| and light up your Facebooks and whatever else y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| But it's a collaborative kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| That's the word that the beautiful people use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| I don't use it, so I won't use it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| But the reality is, it's like I used to say in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| When everybody's a little uncomfortable about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| usually it's a good piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| One of the old-timers told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| And everybody's a little uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| We're in new territory here, so we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| going to try to get it all worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| And I hope that, as they say, the devil's in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| But it's pretty well spelled out in the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| I believe they have the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| They have the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| But actually, I'd love to take credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| But Chris Caldwell and his folks, really, on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| And I guess, Dr. McIntyre, your folks deserve all the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| You know, they did all the work, and I get all the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| But in reality, it's Chris Caldwell did all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| And I'm glad that he put in an extra 30 minutes this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| It's going to be a good thing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| if we can get it all worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I appreciate y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| I appreciate, especially you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| You've been on me about this for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| especially the West Knoxville portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| getting that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| And I appreciate your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And those are my concerns, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| And it just all worked out this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| So thank y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| He's got to go for a speaking engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Is there any other questions of the Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| And it's at the Red Lobster, so my wife and daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| found out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| So I guess I'll be buying dinner tonight, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| For everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Before we go any farther, I want to recognize a few electeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| in the room, besides the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Ms. Patty Bounds is here, and school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| and Ms. Terry Hill, school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Am I missing anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Dr. McIntyre is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| So thank you guys for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| So if any commissioners do not want to speak currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| what we'll do is we'll just go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| I've got a list of 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| We'll go down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| And if anybody, is any commissioners object to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=213)|
| 0:03:33| And Commissioner Brawls did say she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| was going to try to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| She's had transferring the kids and getting them cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| So is there anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| OK, another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| So what we'll do is we've got a list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| And I'm going to take some privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Jackson, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Is Jackson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=236)|
| 0:03:56| Jackson Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| All right, Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| We're going to go ahead and take Jackson first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| If nobody objects, he's not on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| But Mr. Qualls will not be mad at me for long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| So Jackson, if you would come down, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| And pull the mic down to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| And then give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| And give us your stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| My name is Jackson Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| And I live at 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| And I'm 11 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| I wanted to come tonight and tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| thank you for considering the Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Next year, I'll start middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| at sixth grade at Carnes Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| I'm really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Because one, middle school's just scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| And two, it's really crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| I noticed that as I worked my way up at Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| my classes got bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| And the halls became more and more crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| It was harder for my teachers to work with us one on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| And sometimes we needed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| When I was in kindergarten and first grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| my mom would come and eat lunch with me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| But the cafeteria would get so crowded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| that she had to check me out and eat lunch with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Because there's no room for us to sit together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| in the lunchroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I think it's important that you know that ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| since I was a little boy, I struggled with anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| So the addition of more kids didn't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Even though my school and my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| always tried to help me, it was hard to feel calm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| in a class with so many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Another reason I think we need a middle school in Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Valley is because you are taking me out of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Carnes is a great place and a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| But it's not where I play sports, have friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| or go to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| It would be really nice if kids could go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| with the same friends in the place that they all call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| I won't be able to do that because even if you start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| the building or new school now, I'll miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| But maybe my brother won't or all the new kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| that are moving to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| So if you could just think of them when you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| your decision, I'd really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| And one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| My mom told me that there are kids in the Gibbs area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| that are on buses for more than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| Well, that's just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Have you ever ridden the school bus these days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| No one deserves to be on a school bus that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Trust me, I know what happens on a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you again for working so hard to build this new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| The reason I let Jackson go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| is because I wanted you all to try to top that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| So what we're going to do is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| going to go down the list now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| And we're going to CH Qualls, Reverend CH Qualls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| We'll go ahead and bring him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| And what I'll do is I'll need your name, address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| and the rule is five minutes for the first questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| After that, we'll prolong that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| CH?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| CH Qualls, 6208 Maloneville Road, Corrington, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Jackson, first, I want to commend you as a young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| to stand up here before an audience and a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| like this and be as brave as you just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| So kudos to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Chairman Anders, Vice Chair Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| thank you guys for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you for presenting us with this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| to come and speak before the commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| I'm just a representative, an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| that lives in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| But I represent a huge piece of the community, many members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| many people who have fought over the last 24 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| for the Gibbs Middle School to be placed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| inside its community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| The Gibbs community has been through a very long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| and challenging battle to see our middle school return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| since its closure in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Today, our community feels a genuine hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| that this is actually about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| I cannot tell the sense of relief and joy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| our community feels about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| that this dream might soon be a reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| that our children will no longer have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| to endure excessive bus commutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| and that our community will at last have the pieces it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| needs to truly flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| I want to thank Mayor Burchett and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| and Dr. McIntyre and his staff, for working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| to reach the compromise that led today's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| to build the middle schools for both the Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Valley and Gibbs communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Again, as we have said many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| the Gibbs community and Hardin Valley community are friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| We want to do this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| I'd like to thank Commissioner Wright for his tireless efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| to keep the issue in the forefront of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| and for being an incredible advocate for our cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| I also want to thank the Board of Education Chairman Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| McMillan for putting forth the initial proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| to build a Gibbs Middle School, and for his tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| leadership in getting the proposal passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| On behalf of the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| I want to thank the school board for listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| to our voices, and those voices being heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| for understanding the need of the Gibbs Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| and for including it in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| The combined effort of all those that I've mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| as well as the countless others, too many to name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| are what have led us to today's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| This is an incredibly encouraging day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| for the Gibbs community, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| for the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| I'm confident that the school board will support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Dr. McIntyre's proposal to build these two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| And I would urge the members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| to support the proposal that the mayor and the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| have put forward to fund these two much needed facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| I want to thank them both again for the finding of a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I'm confident this commission, Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| will do so as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Thank you for giving us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| to express our desire to see a Gibbs Middle School return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| to the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Speaking on behalf of the Gibbs community, its churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| businesses, and people, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Any questions for sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Next on the list is James Waddell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| Hey, I'm James Waddell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| I live at 5309 Sherborg Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Obviously, I'm here to talk about the Gibbs Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| as well, and to echo some of what CH has already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| We thank you for your time, for listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| to the concerns of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| We thank you for Dr. McIntyre and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| for the recent budget changes that he's made today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| We also thank the school board for putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| through their proposal for the Gibbs Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and for the Hardin Valley School to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| So we're extremely excited that this is a real possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| And I don't know about all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| and I don't know if you actually know the Gibbs community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=634)|
| 0:10:34| A lot of people look at the Gibbs community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| and think of it as a smaller area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| But I tell you, from somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| has lived there, worked there, who's raising their kids there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| goes to church there, the potential for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| is great there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| The potential for our county to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| better by that community growing is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| As I said, I'm a children's pastor at Fairview Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| out in Gibbs, and CH is the youth pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| over at Corrington Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Both of our churches run about 1,500 to 2,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| depending on the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| We have other churches out there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| are growing and thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| We have another church that's building a multimillion dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| facility right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| So we know the potential for those numbers to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| We also know, however, that the number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| reason from our community growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| is there not being a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| We can't tell you how many stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| we've heard from our different members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| that have come to us and said, the one thing that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| keeping me from moving into the Gibbs community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| is there not being a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| So literally, not having that one key element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| is greatly hindering the growth in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| We know from talking to different builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| that there are building plans out there for mega subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| to be built. We also did a state of our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| this past Sunday night at our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| We talked about where our church is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| and where our church is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| And one of the things our senior pastor looked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| we have a report from TDOT that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| there's a projected growth in our area for 10,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| to move into our community over the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| That's without a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| So what we're asking you to not is that you, as the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| will please consider approving what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| the mayor and the superintendent have already put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=740)|
| 0:12:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| I think school board member Roundtree has come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| and also KCA president Lauren Hobson has also come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| So I want to recognize them before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| get to our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Bobbi Christenberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=759)|
| 0:12:51| My name is Bobbi Christenberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| I live at 7110 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville 37909,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| and that's the West Hill subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| I came to the Board of Education meeting last Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| and was troubled by what I heard from the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| and the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| I no longer have children in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| My oldest graduated with Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| and after having gone to West Hills Elementary, Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Middle, and Bearden High School, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| serve on the city solicitations board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I have, over the past few years, been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| concerned about great schools' partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| and their involvement with the schools of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| I have talked with retired teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| and they did not like the intrusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| of this group in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| They have been trained in teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| and do not need to have anyone outside telling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| how to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| This group has developed many programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| to be involved in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| It seems this year they will be turning over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| their programs of TAP, AVID, teachers' mentoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=839)|

| 0:14:18| I was surprised to see Commissioner Brad Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=858)|

| 0:14:31| Also, I've been surprised that Mike Edwards, CEO of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Chamber, is listed as the secretary and treasurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| for the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| I know this group has meant well in their effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| to try to improve our schools, but I don't think it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=884)|

| 0:15:06| There is a 2015 Tennessee Educator Survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=906)|

| 0:15:54| No expensive program is needed for this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| Over the past eight years, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| has funded Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| in the amount of $34,033,488.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| This is according to the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| of State Division of Charitable Solicitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| The private sector in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| has donated $10,838,377 in the past four years also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| The budget, which you're considering at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| includes $2,501,874 for Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| I do not think any more money should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| be given to this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| It is time to listen to your voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| and stop the excessive micromanaging our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and let them teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Then the children will learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Thanks for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Ms. Christenberry, I want to, Ms. Christenberry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| I'm not the chairman of the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| The chairman of the commission sits on their board as a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| but I'm not the chairman of the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Well, that's what is listed on his 501c3 application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Well, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| So I'll correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Any questions for Ms. Christenberry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1030)|

| 0:17:24| Vinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Oh, am I going to say the last one again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Ms. Shepard, next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| I'm Tamara Shepard, 4612 Meredith Road in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| I'm afraid I may be the messenger some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| want to shoot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| But in spite of the incredibly good news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| we got this afternoon to the effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| that Mayor Burchett may well be able to fund Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Schools capital projects in an amount equivalent to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| is needed to build two new middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I'm here to suggest to you that these two new middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| have not been priorities as determined by the $75,000 study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| that Knox County Schools recently commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| and more recently received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| In particular, I want to speak to you about Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| This is my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| I'm a sixth district resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I have a packet that I've distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I'm the person who handed out this packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| with the yellow cover page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And I wanted to ask, since I can't possibly cover all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| in five minutes, if you would kindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| flip ahead to the fifth page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| The fifth page is lifted from the PowerPoint presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| that the school board received in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| of this middle school analysis they commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| What you'll see there, and I've circled it in a big red circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| is that the first of the study's key findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| indicated, and I quote, while population growth exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| peaking in five years and causing uneven capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| distribution, it is not significant enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| to require a net new middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Beneath that, you get some detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| and there's more detail within the body of the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| But essentially, what that $75,000 study concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| is that Knox County is very likely looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| at a temporary spike in system-wide middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1180)|
| 0:19:40| That spike is expected to take place in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| However, when we look nine years out to 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| the study's authors have indicated to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| that we should anticipate a lower system-wide middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| enrollment than we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| And so that's the concern that got me down here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| It's wonderful that unanticipated capital funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| has fallen from the sky like nana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| But irrespective of the volume of capital funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| the school system has to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| the board still has an obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| to properly prioritize its projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| And the two projects under consideration, and like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I know best about the Hardin Valley community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| were not determined to be system-wide priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| by the very folks we hired to research this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| If you'd kindly flip to the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| it's entitled Exhibit 2 in my own handwriting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| and it says Demographic Overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I have underlined in red ink for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| what it is the study determined will likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| be our system-wide middle school enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| both now, that's the first column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| and nine years out in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| And you can see for yourselves that this study did, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| suggest that system-wide enrollment will drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| The next page in my handout relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| to Superintendent McIntyre's frankly inexplicable proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| to the Board of Education after this study became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| And we see that he has, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| proposed a $34,500,000 middle school in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| The next four pages in my handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| and I have them labeled Exhibit 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| this is a four-page spreadsheet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| has long been produced by the KCS Facilities Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Mr. Dillingham, that director, produces it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Mr. Hoyt Whitted, in years past, produced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I picked it up for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| This spreadsheet details for every school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| And of course, it's the board's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| to assess relative needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| There are lots of needs, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| have to assess relative needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| When was each school built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| When did it last receive attention in the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| What is the incidence of portable buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| at that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| He used to indicate for how long portable buildings had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| been parked at a given school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| All of it very useful information in prioritizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I've included it for you, and I've highlighted in yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| for you, the west-lying and the northwest-lying middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| that would potentially be relieved of overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| by a new Hardin Valley middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| And I've highlighted that because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| want to direct your attention to the second from the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| or excuse me, it is the third from the right column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| It's entitled Portable Classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| If you run your finger down that Portable Classrooms column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| third from the right, you can easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| verify for yourselves that each of these west-lying schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Let me hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Let me look over the top of my bifocals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| At each of these west-lying schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and those are Bearden Middle, Cedar Bluff Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| on the next page, Farragut Middle, Kearns Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| On the next page, we have Northwest Middle, Powell Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| and finally, on the last page, we have West Valley Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| You will see that there are zero, zip, nada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| no portable buildings, with the exception of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| located at Cedar Bluff Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I wanted to comment to you about that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| We have slight overcrowding at Cedar Bluff Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| for the sole reason that an abandoned building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| on that parking lot, namely the former Cedar Bluff Intermediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| School, is presently housing a small pre-K program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| and the Knox County Council's PTA program, Teacher Supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| We have students in portable buildings at Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| just two classrooms, because for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| the school system has turned over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| an existing brick-and-mortar building for the use of parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| other than our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Similarly, also in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| we have a half-empty high school in Kearns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| I want to jog your memory about how that came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Ms. Shepard, you've exceeded your five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| so if you'll go ahead and wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I beg your pardon, and I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| In 2008, when the new Hardin Valley High School opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| you'll recall that nobody wanted to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| What happened in 2008 is that Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| pulled nearly 1,000 students from Kearns High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Two years earlier, Kearns High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| had been expanded to a 2,100-seat high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Therefore, Kearns High School has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| stood half-empty for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| And the obvious white elephant in the living room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I should say, in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| is a half-empty high school that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| is available to us at no cost, into which we could migrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| 8th graders from Kearns Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you for giving me an extra minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| but I do encourage you to look over the detail in this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And I have my contact info on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| if I can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Joey, will you call PBA and ask them to heat and air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| Next person on this, Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| I'll speak fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1544)|
| 0:25:44| I have a lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| My name is Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I live at 11835 Couch Mill Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| First of all, thank you all for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| In working with our organized group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Hardin Valley Supports the Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| And as a board member for the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Rescue Squad, I can say that I have a newfound respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and admiration for the depth of your responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| to this county, and also the varying components in which you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| are accountable for overseeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I'd also like to express my sincerest appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| for the collaboration demonstrated today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| among our mayor, Tim Burchett, our school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| and county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| To see community planners and educators come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| like this is exactly how this county should be run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| and I applaud you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| I also want to take just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| and thank our friends in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Journeying alongside you over the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| to get these much-needed schools built has been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And I don't know about you, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| think that maybe from the announcement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| was made today, our politicians might just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| have learned something from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Working together works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| So having said that, thank you for allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| me to speak on behalf of both groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| that I represent, Hardin Valley Supports the Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| and the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| First, I'll address the obvious need for a Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| For the majority of the last 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| our dedicated group of professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| living in the Hardin Valley area have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| spent much of their time raising awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| for the need for a middle school in the Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| sector of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Our group provided indisputable data to our school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| that led to an updated study by the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| and an independent study of all middle schools in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| County with emphasis on Hardin Valley and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| By now, I'm sure that you have seen those studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| and I hope that you have read them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| and also that you've read our findings as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| as the hundreds of statements of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| that you've received from Hardin Valley residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| I won't waste your time restating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| all the numbers and stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I know that this is a huge financial investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| but by voting to build these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| you are preparing for nearly 700 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| that new and current development in the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| will yield by the year end of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| You would be putting into motion a long-term solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| to school issues county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Not including a Hardin Valley middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| or a Gibbs middle school in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| is like not treating a curable diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Next, I'd like to focus on an organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| does so much for our county and gets so little support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| or recognition in return, and that's the Knoxville Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Emergency Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| KVRS is a 501c3 nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| providing essential emergency rescue services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| to all of Knox and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| So in layman's terms, if you're in a vehicle accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| they cut you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| If there is a drowning, they provide the search and rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| If a trench collapses, they secure the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| and lead the recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| If you attend a UT football game, which many of us do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| they are your first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| There is currently no other emergency response agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| in Knox County that can provide the range and level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| of technical emergency services, nor can they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| provide the inventory of emergency equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| that KVRS has attained and is trained to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| When I was asked to serve on the board a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| they were about to close their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Their service area and population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| had grown so exponentially that their funding could no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So as a board, we began to entertain all funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| options and resources available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| We reached out to over 50 local foundations and business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| leaders for investments in our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| In two years, we have received one donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| from a private family foundation and an honorarium gift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| from a deceased board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| We have applied for numerous grants, most of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| we are disqualified because we do not offer fire services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| We've attempted to raise public awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| and educate our citizens that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| employees of the county or the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| but a volunteer organization, to which they generally reply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| I paid my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Why should I donate to your organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| That's what my tax dollars are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Although we receive funding from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| and Knox County, it's simply not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| to operate four stations, and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| being a double Y with bullet holes in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| that services West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Oh, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Fuel in the upwards of $30,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| maintenance of 17 emergency response vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and four boats, ongoing training for six specialty teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| that can easily cost $20,000 to $30,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| supplies for nearly 100 volunteers dedicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| over 40,000 hours of service, and the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| of ongoing changing emergency response equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| This is an organization with a capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| worth of over $5 million, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| operate on an annual budget of $360,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Rent, utilities, and fuel alone consume 70% of the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| that you, Knox County, provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| According to industry standards, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| is estimated that it would cost you, the county, $875,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| a year to provide just the manpower that KBRS provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| That's just people, no benefits, no overtime, no retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| and no stations, equipment, or operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| In 23 years, funding to KBRS from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| has increased by only 2.7%, up until last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| when our new chiefs and our new board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| let you know that that is no longer acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So you see, we've tried to find solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| and time and time again, we have been hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| We've hit walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It would sadden me greatly to see this organization close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| its door, but if the county does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| recognize their worth in this budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| then that is a real possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| So going forward, please consider these final thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| It's been stated that you want the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| to reprioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Yeah, we could all do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| But I say this, that's easier said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| than done when school systems of similar size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| and similar enrollment are receiving multi-million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| more than Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| It's also been stated that Knox County should have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| for inedible tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| You know what, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| And your first step should be to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| to work together with other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| to prepare for current and future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| and address county needs that have long gone been unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Lastly, we've also been reminded that the last tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| increase felt by Knox County was in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Well, let me remind you, this is not 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| and a lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I ask that you please stop using the term tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| as a fear tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Instead, educate the citizens of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| and get them on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Teach them that a $0.01 property tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| would yield approximately $1.2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| And a sales tax increase of half of one penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| will produce nearly $24 million in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| All money that could be used to address needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| countywide, like our schools and emergency service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Help dissipate the negative stigma associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| with increasing taxes and inform the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| of the minimal effect to their wallet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| and the immense positive impact it will have on our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Knox County citizens are ready to do their part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| so please do yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Be strategic and plan a great future for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2022)|
| 0:33:42| Any questions for Ms. Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Next on the list is Brad Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2030)|
| 0:34:02| My name is Brad Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| I live at 2125 Elm Grove Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| I'm a resident of Hardin Valley and here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| really, to talk to you, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| in support of the work that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I appreciate the work that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| The decisions you guys have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| the decisions the school board has to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| the decisions Dr. McIntyre and his team have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| are very complex, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| I come as a resident of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| with kids that are school age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| My daughter's just finished Carnes Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| My youngest son, actually, is a schoolmate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| of best friends with Jackson, and they're both going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| to be entering Carnes next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| But I'm also a business owner, a business consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| and so I have that perspective as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| And then finally, I'm an involved citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Through my business, I've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| participated in quite a bit of community activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| and really, really love the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I love and seek in everything that I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| the health and prosperity of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| And so I appreciate what you guys do from that lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| If nothing else, thinking ahead, the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| that you guys make, the decisions that happen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| every week, every month, can have decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| decades worth of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And that's not insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| So as far as Hardin Valley is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| and I don't know as much about the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| as far as Hardin Valley is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I know that you guys have a vote to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| And again, I appreciate the work that the mayor and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| McIntyre put into this to get where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| But all of the data, as an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| I appreciate all the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I appreciate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| But for me, the case for Hardin Valley Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| is a whole lot more about community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| and it's more about healthy communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and something that I think we need more of in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| And I'm not just in Hardin Valley, but across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Had two really significant events last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| that are, to me, pretty present in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| First and foremost, I was a part of the celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| at ProNova, the opening of that factory out in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and how cool that was to see how many people were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| And I've been a part, as a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| been part of working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And it's exciting to think that within the next decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| we could have 4,000 jobs associated with work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| that those guys have done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Those jobs, those are high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| They're jobs that need really good education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| They're jobs that need things like STEM and math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and the kind of stuff that the school is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| school systems are doing very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| not just in Hardin Valley, but across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| There, and then I had another conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| with Mark Fields from the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| This was on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2238)|
| 0:37:18| We were just passing in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and I was asking him how things are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| and he told me that he's got his list of companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| that are looking at this region as longer than it ever has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| He believes it's kind of a three-year backlog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| from the economy turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Those two things, the economy growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| businesses wanting to relocate, are, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| as much about what these decisions are about as anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Why do companies want to relocate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| they look at all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I've been a part of location analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| so I know a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| But I'll tell you, one of the number one things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| that every business looks for is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| School systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| What you have at Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| honestly, through the work Dr. McIntyre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| and his group have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| you've got a high school that is run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| by one of the most phenomenal principals I've been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| My father was a principal, so I know a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| She and her team are just magnificent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| in the things that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| The elementary school is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So you've got two really well-run organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| that are integral to the community of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| There's no reason for me to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| that a Hardin Valley middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| would not be just as well-run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| and as integrated with those two excellent school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| So what you have an opportunity to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| is to have a model for a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| a set of community schools where the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| are so integral to that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| that I think would be part of bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| more and more businesses to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Again, not that Hardin Valley would be all-in-all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| but it could be a model for the rest of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And again, I don't know as much about Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| but I would say that they probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| could argue the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| But those are the things that I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| to leave you guys with as you make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I think it's much bigger than buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| It's much bigger than the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and all those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| It really is about there's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| in that area to build on a very deep sense of community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| a very set of variables that have been cared for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| like I said, really, really excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| and well-run schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Add a third to that, and I think you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| a dynamic, a very dynamic combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Brian Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Is Brian Allen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Shelly Weiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| And to let you all know, the PBA said everybody's air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| conditioners out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| I think the mayor flipped the switch on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Everybody in the building's out, so we apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Hi, my name is Shelly Weiss, 6817 Westland Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| I would like to start by profusely thanking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| the entire school board, our wonderful mayor, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| McIntyre, and the commission for working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I personally am an educator, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| been with Knox County Schools for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| and I'm a mother of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| And I am in full support of a middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| for the Hardin Valley and the Gibbs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And the news earlier today left me ecstatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| And I saw all over the Facebook feed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| everybody was all excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| And it wasn't the 2% raise that I was excited about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| because as an educator, most of us would say, it's not me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| it's the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| And the excitement was for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| coming together in agreement about the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| specifically Hardin Valley Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| since I teach at the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| I've been there for 10 years, and over the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| I've witnessed several of the side effects of overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Increased student and teacher ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| directly affects the time that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| have to address the very needs of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Two years ago, we lost our intervention specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| due to budget cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| And yet, the number of students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| are being placed on tier intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| continues to grow as our classes continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| With more students, we've seen a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| in supplementary equipment and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| There's been a generalized increase in social conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And I can go on and on and on about all this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| but after listening to one of the previous speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| you can't put money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| And I guess I could say, you can make any kind of analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| over numbers, and we have become the king and queen of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| So a study that somebody said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| about not having in 2024 amount of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| to be able to go to the middle school is a ridiculous thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| to even say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We're overcrowding the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| We already know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| A couple of years ago, we had a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| And it took kids out of their home community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| And the gentleman that just spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| did a great job of explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| It took the kids out of their community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| and sent them off to other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| The school feeder schools are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| bigger and bigger and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| It's inevitable that the middle schools are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| to be taking on more children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| Ask a middle school student what the most important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| in their life is beside their cell phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and they're going to tell you it's their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Imagine attending an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| with a group of best friends only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| to be forced to go to another middle school because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Let's suppose you're an otter student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| at your previous school, which some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| of the kids in my classroom have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| And because of overcrowding, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| a limited number of spaces for these classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Your social and academic future has been put on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Is that going to show up on your end of the year assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| With parent and neighborhood and partner input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| and involvement, community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| can be a positive center of influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| to benefit students, families, and the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| I could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| But for the people that are not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| driven because of the students, let's talk about some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| I live personally in the Rocky Hill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| My husband and I have been looking for a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| in Hardin Valley for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| We have twin six-year-old boys who attend my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| and they'll be in first grade this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| We've been looking in the Hardin Valley area for a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| to live so they will be able to grow up with their friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| that they go to school with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| The Hardin Valley area real estate market is on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| No sooner does a house go on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| than it appears on a website as pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| I keep contacting my realtor, and every time I find a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| he said, it's already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| An offer has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| The realtor that I have has been told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| that the Hardin Valley area is the fastest selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| zip code in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I still haven't found a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Drive out to the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| and you will immediately notice that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| you exit Pellissippi, all the apartment buildings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| are under construction, there are approximately 1,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| new or under construction residential homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| in our Northwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| This number could easily yield 630 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| within the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Even with rezoning, it's estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| that the four feeder schools would be at 111% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| I've been told at 30 kids per classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| we're talking about 17 portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| Thankfully, whoever was smart enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| to design the roads in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| was also smart enough to know that even though the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| of the land at the time was cow pastures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| that it would soon be bustling with growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Since I have been at the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| the academy was built, as well as three strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| malls, a food city, two churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| and various other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Thank goodness the individuals on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| then were extremely intelligent and made Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Road with four lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Perhaps some of you are those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And if so, I say, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Perhaps you will have the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| that in order to avoid a catastrophe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| would affect a growing community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| we must address this need immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| and start construction of Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Governor Haslam has put our state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| in the spotlight by implementing the Tennessee Promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| And Dr. McIntyre has a famous quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| that everyone in our Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| is familiar with and lives by, excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Please do not put my future middle school students at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| to achieve their goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I'm requesting that you, members of our distinct county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2764)|

| 0:46:14| Kyle Ritter, Kyle Ritter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2774)|
| 0:46:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| My name is Kyle Ritter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| I live at 11705 Edison Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| And I want to begin this evening by thanking each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| for your public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| I am a fellow public servant, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| share some of the same challenges in our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| I know the value of your time, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| seek to use my time efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| I've lived in Knox County for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| My dad was a superintendent in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I worked as a second grade bilingual teacher in Texas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| before I moved to public service in a different sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Public education and public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| has always been near and dear to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I am biased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Any real analysis has to start with recognizing our own bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| I live in Hardin Valley, and I have three kids, Kylie, eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Sienna, five, and Calvin, two, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| would attend the new middle school in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| I would benefit from the middle school in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| more than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| To overcome that bias, I need to recognize it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| and also find some facts with a little help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| from those who are not so biased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| The independent study illustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| the need and the urgency for a middle school in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| I won't beat the dead horse of the overwhelming statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| used to illustrate that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| We've all seen them over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| They are overwhelming, independent, and unbiased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Short-term fixes or punting the tough choices down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| are no longer options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| That is why I was heartened when I heard the news this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| of the potential option to fund the middle schools in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Hardin Valley and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Middle school years are an especially difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| It is generally the least favorite time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| in most people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Overcrowding exacerbates this already challenging time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Education in an overcrowded school is a lesser education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| It is less than the children deserve from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| The education they deserve will enable their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| The education they deserve will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| them to keep them from a life of crime, or welfare, or despair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| It will give them peace, prosperity, and hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Knox County schools seem to be doing an amazing job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| on the quality of the education they provide with the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| that they are given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| They stretch every dollar they're granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Tax dollars should be treated as sacred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| and Knox County schools are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Let's give our educators the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| that they need to serve the growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| population in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Across the ideological divide, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| recognize the significance of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Education is such a priority that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| should invest for the future by funding what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| right and best for our children, however that must be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Give the parents, the teachers, and the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| more hope for a better future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| There will be tough choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| It can be difficult, but it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I'm grateful for those who made the tough choices that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| led to my education, and I hope that those choices are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| made for my children, and also the children in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I thank you to Dr. McIntyre, to Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| and this commission for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2980)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2981)|
| 0:49:41| We have one more on our list, and after this is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2981)|
| 0:49:49| I'll give people an opportunity to come speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| and if there's somebody that didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| So Bob Colorado, and I hope I pronounced that right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| I apologize if I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| It's Bob Colorado, and I'm at 11033 Eagle Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| Lane in the Hardin Valley, but I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| here to talk about the new middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| although I'm very proud of what you've done for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| And thank you for giving us all this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Again, my name is Bob Colorado, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| proud to say that I'm a board member of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I'm joined here by many of our, can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I'm joined here by many of our 126 current volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| plus several board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Chief Fraser couldn't be here, but the rest of his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Our rescue squad is a 5013C nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| providing essential emergency rescue services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| to all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Our rescue squad was chartered by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| in 1958.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| To be brief, our rescue squad is the primary emergency response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| agency for motor vehicle accidents and entrapments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| water rescue, search and rescue, technical rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| trench and structural collapse, cave and vertical rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| and large community event support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| In fact, as we speak, there is a tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| falling on a car on Bell Road, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| a 26-year-old female that is trapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and has a baby in the backseat of the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| and they're currently extricating her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| from the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Our members, our volunteer members, are unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| These are the men and women of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| who work other full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| But luckily for Knox County, these volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| are dedicated to the well-being of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| They are highly skilled, trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| and certified for specialized rescues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| for vertical, cave, heavy, and deep water rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| These are the elite rescue members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| In your most critical hour, we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Today, our rescue squad is 100% volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| upholding the great reputation that this state has maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| throughout much of our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Our mission is essential, and our mission is time critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Our goal today is to fix some of the more dangerous shortcomings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| with the rescue squad capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| and we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Our total budget is approximately $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| of which 51% is funded by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| The city, which only uses a rescue squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| for specialty rescues, provides approximately 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| and the rest is provided by United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| and private donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Our task, however, is mostly for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Through service assessment studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| it was determined that our fully volunteer approach is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| enough to provide around-the-clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| timely protection to the more than 440,000 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| We are currently unable to have volunteers in our stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| This slows response, often at some of the most critical times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I'm speaking today to let you know that without full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| coverage in each of our four stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| we as Knox County citizens are deprived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| of time-critical rescues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| To put it simply, we need 24-7 staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| in each of our four stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Our response times need to be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| and the only way to do that is by adding paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| We are asking for a first-step approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| to allow our rescue squad to better service the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| in a time-critical manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| This first step involves staffing our two busiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| locations full-time, with at least three rescue specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| 24-7, 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| This is a much-needed step, as right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| our west station is manned only 54% of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| throughout the year, and that is unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| is requesting 447,500 in additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| in order to accomplish this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Currently, our rescue squad has four strategically-located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| stations in the four quadrants of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| We have one in north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| We will use that additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| to staff our east and our west stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| our busiest ones, full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| This will help serve the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| That way, we can reduce response times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| and perhaps save a life that may not have been saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| is up against several obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| First, our county is growing, and our capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| to adequately cover the area is lessening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| Second, our volunteer base is dropping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| People are working more and enjoying time off less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| It's really hard to volunteer these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| and without paid staff, our facilities go unmanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And to me, that is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| In closing, myself and the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| at Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| greatly appreciate your time and look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| to working with you to help the citizens of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| rest easy, knowing that in the most critical hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you again for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Can you stay there just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Because I want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| We've had that discussion as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| and I really want to talk to you a little bit about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Bob's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| The people that have been volunteering for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| are EMTs or they're firefighters somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| And whenever they get a second shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| they're not going to go spend a free day at the rescue squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| when they can go get paid somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| So that's kind of something that we're running up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| And the days of volunteer emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| for a county, we're the third largest county in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| and sometimes we need to start acting like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| And that's kind of what I've been talking to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| about for the last two years as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3376)|
| 0:56:16| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3377)|
| 0:56:17| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3378)|
| 0:56:18| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3379)|
| 0:56:19| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3380)|
| 0:56:20| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Mr. Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3381)|
| 0:56:21| Bob, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| You gave us a figure of 447,500 to staff those two stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| with three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Is that the minimum that you can get by with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| It's not really the maximum, but it is a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| that we can get by with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| What's the minimum you can get by with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| What's the least you can get by with to staff those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3403)|
| 0:56:43| Around $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3405)|
| 0:56:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| I stand at $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| It's not an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| They'll hear $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| How many vehicles do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| 21 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| And they're divided between the four stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| Well, they're different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3423)|
| 0:57:03| I mean, they count a vehicle as a boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| Let me ask you another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Where do you get your call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| If someone calls 9-1-1, does 9-1-1 call the rescue squad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| We're dispatched any time there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| a vehicle accident in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Rural Metro Fire, Rural Metro Ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| and the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| is dispatched to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| What about in Carnes, or whatever territory it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| Or Seymour takes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| And surrounding counties, and surrounding states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| We've been called out to surrounding states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I don't want to pay for other counties and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Chairman Brown, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Come down to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| My name is Aaron Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| I'm Assistant Chief of Daily Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| And what they're talking about is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| staff, or spend time looking for staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| for those particular trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Those trucks are out of four of our stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And they're manned with anywhere from two to three EMTs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| or paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| We get the call from 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| We respond with other agencies to a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| Now, if there's not a staffing at one of our stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| then I've spent time on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| of trying to get someone to cover for that truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| We've got a truck down west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| We've got a truck east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| We've got a truck south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| And we've got a truck north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| When you get the call, and these other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| also got the call, is that duplicate services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| I mean, do they have EMTs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| And I mean, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3532)|
| 0:58:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| No, we provide, as we provide extrication and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| like that, we also provide medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| trained medical personnel on our trucks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| We are a first out organization, or first out unit of the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| When they respond, we respond as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| We're also within that area, within less than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| or a half from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Those trucks, we try to staff those trucks 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| And we do an excellent job at staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| The problem is that the manpower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| we have other individuals or other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| that work full-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And if we were a paid department to have a paid staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| then we could pay that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| to be on that truck full-time instead of leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3597)|
| 1:00:05| at a certain time or a particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| How many calls a year do you respond to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Approximately 1,900 calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| 1,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Mr. Chairman, I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| would he mind to have the volunteers from the rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| squad to stand up and be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3626)|
| 1:00:38| What I've told Chief Frazier, and we've had discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Chris and I have already had discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| but what I've told Chief Frazier is that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| need to have a definitive collaborative plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| that everybody is on board with and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| And this also goes back to our fire service committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| on who provides what and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| we don't duplicate some of those things you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| So we'll have continued discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I'm going to say Bob, because I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| to mess up your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| We've exhausted the list of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| OK, we've exhausted the list of those who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Or is there anybody else that came and did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| sign up and would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3681)|
| 1:01:21| Come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3682)|
| 1:01:33| Lauren Hopson, 6513 Foxhound Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I didn't really have anything prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| I wasn't sure I was going to make it on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| because I had a previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| So excuse me if I end up turning my paper all sideways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| to read all my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| I haven't really had a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| to digest the press conference from this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| But the few things that I do know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I am absolutely thrilled that the middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| that whole situation seems to be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| I also think it's a good idea that Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Administration is moving out of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I think there are a lot more economically feasible places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| that that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I am, however, concerned about the decrease in teacher raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| from 4% to 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Part of the reason I'm concerned about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| is that Knox County Schools has an MOU with its teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| that calls for a 4% raise this year if funds are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Of course, that's a bunch of mumbo-jumbo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| in there if funds are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| The thing that concerns me about that is a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| the funds were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| And now, all of a sudden, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| So again, teachers have been put on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| And the thing that's really concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| about that as far as our community goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| is Governor Haslam was the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| recommended the 4% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| We also know that only about 40% of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| actually comes from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| It's up to the local districts, the local communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| to come up with the rest of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| So when we've gone from a 4% raise down to 2% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| what that means is our community is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| kicking in almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Because we would get about 2% from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| So basically, we're doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Again, as a community, if we say we value teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| and we want to be able to attract and keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| the best, most qualified teachers, at a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| we're going to have to step up to the plate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| and put our money where their mouth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| And I'm speaking to this also because basically, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| is an income inequality issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I realize that I'm speaking to a board primarily composed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| of men, with the exception of Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| And although I know there are many dedicated and fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| male teachers out there, a couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| are up there in the corner, the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| is this is a predominantly female profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And to continue to deny those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| is really setting up a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| women are not being given the income equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| And it happens year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And we have to look at that not just as a money issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| but as a social issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| I certainly hope that the MOU that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| going to be entered into has a little bit of teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| Because what an MOU does is it requires good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| on the part of both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| So I hope that there will be something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| to be vigilant about making sure that that agreement is stuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| to whatever that agreement ends up being in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Because speaking as a teacher in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| and looking at the MOU that we have with Knox County school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| system, it seems like sometimes our MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| doesn't have the kind of teeth that we need it to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| So I just hope that you all will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| ensure that whatever memorandum is agreed upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| that it's stuck to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Senator Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Ms. Hobson, could you come back down please for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I've already been blasted about calling schools businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| But anyway, what I'd like for you to explain to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| is what's the difference between step-raise and regular raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| The way a step-raise right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| structured in Knox County Schools, for every year of seniority you have, you get a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| amount of additional income for each year. And that's important because that is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| those pieces that tells a teacher that you value their experience. It's not dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| upon any evaluation scores. I know some people would have a problem with that, but when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| actually become familiar with our evaluation system and you realize how subjective it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| that a certain amount of teachers will have poor evaluation scores based on the test scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| of kids they don't even teach, you really do need to have something that takes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| out of the equation. So basically those step raises are just in place for every year of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| seniority that you get. And so any additional base income raise that would come on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| that would be different, and it would affect your step raises every year. And when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| give a teacher a raise, it affects more than just that year of income. It basically affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| their income for every year after that until they leave teaching. That also has an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| on their retirement because their retirement is based on their top five earning years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| So even giving a small percentage raise every year can drastically affect things, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| that one year. That's the end of your question. Thank you. Commissioner Smith. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| Mr. Chairman. Chris, could you come down and somebody from Dr. McIntyre's? Slow down, fellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4002)|
| 1:07:04| I'm sorry, Ms. Hobson, were you finished? Did you need me to say anything or did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4024)|
| 1:07:12| want me to go? Chris, looking at this compromise that's been worked out and looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| into the future, with the debt service and the operation costs, and I'm glad that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| found a way to get these schools, but I don't want everybody to think this isn't going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| come with a cost. And that cost is going to be in year 18 and 19. Given our natural growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4050)|
| 1:07:38| pattern, the trend that we've been having, given some of the stated strategic plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4058)|
| 1:07:46| goals of the schools, what kind of cuts are they going to be looking at making in years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| 18, 19, and 20 to stay within the realm of the budgetary allotment? In years 18, 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| and 20? After these schools are online with their operation costs. Sure. There will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4079)|
| 1:08:11| about a $5 to $6 million decrease on the debt service payments of the schools. And so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4091)|
| 1:08:21| schools will approximately, round numbers, $3 million apiece to operate. So that's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4101)|
| 1:08:29| of even out there. And so then you do have, and we've discussed this, fixed cost increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| every year, which include the step raises that were just now discussed, along with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| things, whether it's utility costs. I mean, you can go on with a number of things. Benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| costs. And so there will be, I mean... Plus the operation costs. Yeah. Plus the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| costs. And the debt service costs of the school. I mean, we will structure those to where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| not paying interest only, or just a little bit of principal. You will see a structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| principal payment schedule. We've talked about that. We've talked about that with our bonding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| with our bond rating agencies, about getting to a standard payment schedule when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| to principal. And so we'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| If you look at the last, say, four years of general purpose school funds budgets, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4173)|
| 1:09:45| look at five years. We'll go ahead and go the whole route. From about 385 to about 402,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| so that's 17, right? 402 to 420, that's about 18. 420 to 425, that's about 5. And so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4190)|
| 1:10:04| a lower one. 425 to 438, there's some fund balance, of course, in there from us. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| about 10. And it's really 14 when we talk about the growth, about they're not using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| fund balance in this current year. So there's no doubt that you'll see a couple of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| years, and you usually see what I would call an average year of growth. And so as those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| average years of growth happen, we'll have to look at things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| So we're going to fund the 2020 plan. What are the fixed cost increases? What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4230)|
| 1:10:39| market doing that would affect our D.C. plans that we have to fund each and every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| On the committee, he understands. And so that will have an impact, for sure. And so part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| of the reason, I think, in our MOU, we've got to, I encourage you to read the MOU when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| you get time, talks about in 13, number 13, we talk about the county finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| working with the school's finance department to identify ways and means to reduce the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| and to reduce educational expenditures in order to do, to operate these schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| to pay for the debt service and to pay for the 2020 plan. And that could include a litany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| of things. And we will bring some of those reports quarterly to the committee that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| chair, and we can discuss those things and see if that's a route that we go down. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| it will, of course, be talked about a lot during, as we discuss each and every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| at the budget. And so I feel that this path, I mean, listen, do we have to tighten our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4309)|
| 1:11:59| belts sometimes? Sure. I mean, we do. And that's okay. I think there's no doubt that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4319)|
| 1:12:07| doing two schools and giving a raise comes with a price, okay? I won't deny that. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4327)|
| 1:12:18| the raise, I mean, we're locking ourself in to $5 million more next year, okay? That'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| be a cost that's there, because you're giving a raise, and a raise is a recurring expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| and that will be there. So will growth keep up with that? That's what we'll have to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| We haven't got finalized BEP numbers yet. We should probably be getting our June estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| any day now. We'll get final BEP numbers in August, and we'll see if that goes up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| or stays about the same. I suspect it'll stay about the same. I don't think it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| move much. I don't think sales tax will move much, as long as the state can code things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| correctly. So I think we can do this. We'll just have to watch our fiscal ship and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4382)|
| 1:13:16| sure that we're headed in the right direction. I think Dr. McIntyre would be the first to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| tell you that our room for error is small. There's no doubt. I mean, we're on the cusp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| of a fund balance. There's not a lot of wiggle room. We've just got to hope that the projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| that we made on sales tax and on property tax were good or were low when we beat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| I know that's a long answer, but there's nothing short about this MOU and there's nothing short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4422)|
| 1:13:51| about looking two and three years down the road. If I could sit here and tell you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| was going to happen then, I probably wouldn't be here. But I'll take you with me if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| want to go. It's just watching it. I think quarterly we come to you and we give you reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4445)|
| 1:14:14| We say we're going to have a surplus or we're going to have a deficit or what are we looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| at? If we're going to have a deficit, what can we do to cut expenditures to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| less? I think that's what we look at. It's just trying to get it right on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| I agree with Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Nobody has said robust or collaboration tonight, so you're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| I think Chris is right. I think what this proposal guarantees is a continued conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| about revenues and expenditures. Part of what I think is important about it is that we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4502)|
| 1:15:11| to work toward one of our common goals. I said this this afternoon, it's certainly Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| Burchett's and my common goal, but I think it's also the school board's common goal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| the County Commission and that's continued fiscal responsibility to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| providing an outstanding education to our kids in a way that is fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| and appropriate. I really think that this proposal, if it's approved by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| if it's approved by the Board of Education, will allow that dialogue to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| So you believe that the MOU is workable and you fully intend to stand by the agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| Yeah. I like the proposal that we've crafted together. I'm sure there will be some back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| and forth on specific language and things like that, but I think generally the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| is one that yes, I endorse and I believe makes a lot of sense moving forward. It allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| to move forward with a 2% raise for our teachers, to build two schools, and I think it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| so in a fiscally responsible manner. So yes, I think that's a win all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| All right. Anybody else that was not on the list want to speak? I do want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4583)|
| 1:16:32| Chairman McMillan snuck in on us, which is a political savvy move. He gets mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| all by himself. So thank you, Mike, for being here. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| Can I ask Mr. Caldwell a quick question or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| If it's not about the air conditioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| No, we won't talk about the air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| First I did want to thank you for your efforts on the budget as a new commissioner. I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| appreciate your open door policy and working with me and educating me on our budget. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| also want to ask you about the long-term debt of the two schools. I guess in comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| when you look at the Hardin Valley Academy, it's going to cost the taxpayers in excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| of $90 million when we finally pay for that school. What do you think at $34 million for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| the Hardin Valley Middle School and say $30 million for the Gibbs Middle School, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| those final costs will be to the taxpayers on the current bond rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| I left those projections upstairs, but I'll get those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| Just roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| You can't ask math questions in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| I know. It's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| $120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| What'd you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| $120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I think that's a fair guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| You're saying $65,000. If we get low enough interest rates, we make a due $110,000, $115,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4669)|
| 1:17:59| if we structure it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Listen, when I say structure, if you read Moody's and S&P, our bond ratings, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| see them kind of slap us on the hand a little bit occasionally saying that in the past we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| structured some of our bonds, so we don't pay a lot of principal at first. It's back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| loaded. For the non-financed people, it's like a balloon payment, kind of like. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4700)|
| 1:18:29| as big of a balloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| So we have strived to fix that over time, and so as we look at issuing bonds over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| next two and three years that will include these schools, what you will see from us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| structured principal payments that will be approximately the same years one or two through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| There will be 20-year bonds, and our hope is, listen, it's a good time to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| market. I mean, it is. We saw rates slowly start to climb, and so issue them, structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4738)|
| 1:19:08| them appropriately, and that way we don't pay as much in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| So, I guess what I was trying to, because since we have so many representatives from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| the Gibbs community here, just so they know that it's really not a $30 million middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| school. It's more like a $55 or a $58 million middle school by the time we end up paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| With interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| It is. I mean, 40, 45. I think potentially we may can build it for a little less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Just round figures, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| But, yeah, I think, yeah, there's no doubt you've got to include the interest cost, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| we have to pay that, and it could be $45 or $50 or $55. It just depends on how we structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Okay. Thank you again for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| No problem. That's what I'm here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When will we go to market for these bonds and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| It's been a long day, but it's going to be October 2nd at 10 a.m. I'm just kidding. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| don't know. I mean, I don't. I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| It's, you know, we'll probably go September, October. I mean, it's normally what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| We'll do August or September and maybe issue them in October. I mean, I think that's roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| a good estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| So we'll go this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I think we will. I do think so, because we don't want to miss the boat and rates keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| on going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| That's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| I wasn't being smart, I assure you, but we have a really good rapport, so I can say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| to Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Yeah, it's, we have went to, you know, a couple of years before and issued, you know, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| years at once. And what that does, it does save you on issuance costs. But in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| no, I think the sooner we can issue it, the better. We actually talked about that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| bit today about, you know, we're going to issue this, because, you know, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| working on this plan to include the two middle schools since May the 11th. I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| Kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| It's been a weekend. It's been a great weekend for me, and so I'm punch drunk, so it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| So when would our payments on these bonds start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| Let me think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| We usually do semi-annually, some semi-annual payments, so maybe, we like to pay just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4883)|
| 1:21:34| you know in May, because that's after all the revenues came in. So it may be about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| year from now. It could be as early as December, but I don't think it could be that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| We're talking about the lowering of debt service for the schools occurring in five years. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| for the next five years, we will be? Well, I think their debt service schedule they showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| me had two schools in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| It said about level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| The schedule that you saw, and which I have used as well, included the same amounts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| we said that they would issue up to, and so that did include those, and it still had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| decrease, and so with that in there, the offset will pay for the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4932)|
| 1:22:20| For the majority of the operations, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you, Chris. Go get some sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Any other questions? All right. Anybody else from the audience? One last call. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| I just wanted to add one more important detail that I forgot earlier in response to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| Bussler's question about the step increases. Those step increases only go through year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150608?start=4959)|
