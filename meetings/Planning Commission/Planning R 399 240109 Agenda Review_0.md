| 0:00:33| Well, let's get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| Welcome, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=34)|

| 0:00:38| Welcome to our January agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| At this time, I will turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| Happy New Year to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| I just have a few announcements for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| a couple things coming up I'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| So next month, you know, looking ahead, you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| the Planning Commission will be asked to make a recommendation on the county's land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| As you all know, this project has been underway for the last three, approximately three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| and it really is a result of a lot of data analysis and community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| You all participated in some workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| Some of you came out to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| And it is a process to create a new plan for the unincorporated areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| The plan has been posted on Advanced Knox website for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| I think I sent out a link a month or two ago, but I will resend that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| After this next Planning Commission meeting, I'll let you all get past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| I encourage you to take a look at the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| We've added quite a few new resources to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| and we will be preparing a presentation for you all at your agenda review next month on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| So, you know, please take a few moments to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| If you have any questions, concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| If there's things that you think that we need to be sure to cover, I would welcome those thoughts in advance so we can be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:10| As you all know, or hopefully know, the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee is going to meet again tomorrow at 5 p.m. in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| They'll be considering amendments by Knox County to the Growth Policy Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| and if approved, that plan is going to move forward to County Commission, the City of Knoxville, and the Town of Farragut for re-approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| The website has been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| There's a tab specifically to the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| The plan itself has been updated with revised plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| There's a revised amendment, FAQs that have been updated and will continue to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| and other planning-related resources that I think you all will find of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| So we encourage you to check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| So in staff changes, I'm really excited to announce a staffing change to the Transportation Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| You know, with Jeff Welch's retirement this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| we've been exploring opportunities for the current staff to take on some new roles and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| And I'm pleased to announce that Doug Burton, some of you may know Doug, he has been with our agency for 34 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| and he has a wealth of knowledge and experience related to transportation planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| but also, probably more importantly, related to the people and places in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| And so he will be taking on this new TPO coordinator position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and I think his experience and context is going to position him really well in this new role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| and we are looking forward to see what he does with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| And he will be your primary point of contact for all TPO matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| Forty under 40. So congratulations are in order for a fellow commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| Commissioner Schelso was nominated as one of the 40 under 40 for 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| So congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| If you all haven't seen the brief article, I will send that out to everybody so you all can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Good interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Yeah, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| There are two other business items on the agenda related to the administration of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| and the purpose of the edits to those is to clean up language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| and to ensure that our rules and regulations are in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And it's been a number of years since we have thoroughly reviewed either one of those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| So 11C, I'll just briefly go over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| 11C23OB, which is agenda item 49, is the administrative rules and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| And those were updated to improve readability, remove outdated procedures and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| align rules with current practices and procedures of the commission of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| and then most importantly, to ensure compliance with Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| And there are redlined and a clean version in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| 12B23OB is agenda item 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Those are the bylaws of the Knoxville-Norris County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| and they were updated to make the bylaws more specific to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| and planning commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| When you read through those two documents over the years, there's been kind of a mixing of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| We felt like it was very important to make sure that the bylaws are specific to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and ensure that any general information related to the day-to-day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| or were moved to the administrative rules and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| We removed outdated language and procedures, as we did in the administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| And then, again, most importantly, we wanted to ensure compliance with Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| As you all know, things change from year to year, and we really need to stay on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| So, you know, going forward, you might see more frequent changes to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| if things change at the state level that we feel like we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Any other questions, concerns for me right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Want to get into the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| So we're going to start off with Agenda Item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| So I'm just going to try to reposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| Just give a quick high-level overview of what is going on with these few related cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| So what I have on the left shows four different colored areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Those are four different rezoning cases that are all associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| The two on the bottom of the page in the circle or with the red outline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| those are the two cases that are going forward this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| The two cases on the upper part of the page, 1L24 and 1K24RZ, those are being tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| So we're not going to discuss those today, but just know it's all the same applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| They're all kind of related to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| but really we're just going to be discussing the 1M24 and 1N24RZ on the bottom of the page there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| So starting off with the 1M24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=419)|
| 0:07:13| Okay, let's try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| So this one does have a sector plan amendment with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| and what they're requesting is to go from low-density residential to mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| which is the South Knox Gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| So this property is all the way down in the southern part of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| but near the Superior County border, so it's just north of Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| And associated with that is the rezoning to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| The property is currently partially zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| So real quick on a—let me see if I've got my—there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| My laser pointer came off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| So with the sector plan amendment, so the full parcel is this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| which you can see outlined on the bottom image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| What they're requesting for CA is just the hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| There's already a strip of CA zoning on the front part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and that's one of those legacy CAs where they, a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| just rezoned about 225 feet, 250 feet on each side of the road for a swath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| So that's part of that type of zoning along Chapman Highway down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| So they're requesting to expand the CA zoning further to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| As you'll see, the second rezoning that we are going to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| is a planned residential on this property, just the rest of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| Just to jump ahead, the staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| and the rezoning, the rezoning with one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| which essentially is that before grading and building permits are issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| the development plan shall be brought to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| for review and approval to go over these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| to ensure that the site is compliant with these mixed-use district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| And I'll go over that in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| because I just kind of glazed over that just to get to the recommendation part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| So the rezoning again, so it's only the portion highlighted in blue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| As you can see, again, CA zoning kind of strip along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| There is shopping center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| That zoning has been there since about the 50s as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| so it's been there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| It's largely undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| There's a golf driving range in a small strip center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| and across the street is a large cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| Sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| So on the left here, you see this is the mixed-use special district now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| They're wanting to expand it into their property to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| They're also requesting the same mixed-use special district across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| which is the part of the property that they're tabling for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| So if everything gets approved over time as they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| this mixed-use special district will actually be pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| The mixed-use special district does specifically talk about expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| to the north side of Chapman Highway to where this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| the Bauer fields are, which are baseball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| It's where the PP public park sector plan is currently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| It does not mention expanding into the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| though I'm not sure why it didn't recommend it other than it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| recommend low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| So I guess the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| everyone felt that the low-density was more appropriate in the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I will say that this property in the past did not have the best site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| distance, so it may have played into it as well on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Since then, TDOT has made improvements to Chapman Highway here and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| improved, specifically the intersection at Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| But also some other improvements along the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| So I think things have improved since the sector plan was updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Just real quick aerial of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| You can see it's largely wooden now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| And I'll point out there's a natural gas line that runs through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| You can see that's the natural gas line that runs through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| So I'll point out the natural gas line that runs through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| That's the gas line that comes through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| natural gas line that runs through here you see that kind of line going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| the trees and I'll point that up more in the next rezoning. Just another view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=696)|

| 0:11:48| back is the PR 5. So the sector plan amendment or the sector plan what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| want to do is extend this South Knox County Gateway District it's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| hard to see here but essentially what it's saying is rezone properties to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| plan district or something that requires development plan review and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| design principles to consider during the development plan review are in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| table here and I'm not going to go over that but it's talking about you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| potential things to look at our low impact development techniques proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| greenways there is a proposed greenway on the opposite side of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| well in a plan not necessarily to for construction today let me clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| talks about signage and exterior lighting architectural design impervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| services you know parking lot landscaping and front yard front inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| yard landscaping so it has a list of items that wants to address because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| is you know as you're coming north on Chapman Highway this is the entrance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Knox County so the idea is to try to make sure this is you know aesthetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| pleasing area and so that's the reason why we're recommending the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| plan review with the CA zoning and not just CA zoning by itself because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| otherwise these principles don't get considered anybody have any questions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:27| that one just I will point this out on the next discussion but but you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:38| there's stub outs to Simpson Road here there's one further back here and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| off of Highland View Circle I think that's the name of the road there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| couple of stub outs but essentially they they do touch several road frontages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| including Highland View Drive here and West Simpson Road appears near Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Highway so the property has a lot of potential connection points which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| beneficial that's what I was gonna ask about was the so that this part gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| rezoned commercial that one stub out is going directly into the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| section yeah you don't really know what they're gonna do yet whether they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| want to even connect to that with the commercial property it does allow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| potential yeah until we see development plan we don't really know what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:32| how they're actually gonna make the connections to the property can you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| back to the aerial where it was showing the actual yeah so am I right in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| the blue area of which would be rezoned commercial mm-hmm is touching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| residential right now yes there's a residential house here and there's these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| two lots are zoned agricultural but they're platted for four houses then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| there's a house here I guess you know there's houses along West Simpson as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| well right with the gas line easement here there's a little bit of a buffer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| some degree there's just but yeah that's also part of the challenge was making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:24| connection back over to West Simpson is having to deal with that gas line that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| can't I don't know if they would need to grade down to even cross that or not but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| it's something that it's harder to cross those gas lines and but they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| not have much of a problem I don't know it's kind of hard to tell is that set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| back from Chapman highways that right-of-way there this part here yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| well this is already zoned CA okay yeah so that zoning would stay regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| the recommended condition would not apply to that that part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| would just be the back part which is which is beneficial because then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| opportunity to review how what kind of impacts there is to the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| residential and potentially require screening and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| I'm 31 yep I am 31 so as I mentioned this is also on the same property the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:32| properties already zones are a they are requesting in plan residential up to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| dwellings per acre this is in the low-density residential sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=996)|

| 0:16:48| so high-level sector plan map the subject property is here in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| the property just to the north like I said that they're wanting to expand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| mixed-use special district over so just know that might change there's a medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| density in the general area low density to the southwest and then also to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| north north and northeast in the zoning map again you say you can see there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| swath of commercial on there there is plan residential to the southwest plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| residential up to one 1.3 dwellings per acre and 1.47 dwellings per acre this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| property was developed before sewer came in so that those lots are at least 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| thousand square feet or more so a little bit bigger in size this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| it's really it's a pretty good sized property at 1.47 dwellings per acre but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| they're concentrating all those lots down into the most buildable portion so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| those lot sizes are about five thousand five hundred square feet so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| they're on the smaller side if you look at a gross density for this built-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| portion it's probably about four point seven dwellings per acre but like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| the property itself is really large and has a lot of hillside in the back so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| protecting all that and okay so this is the topography map and what the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| why I wanted to show this is that there's there's only one little portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| of this property or this portion of the property that's in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| protection area but in general I mean it still has a lot of slope to it you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| from West Simpson Road is the low point you know going up towards Valley View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| Drive it gets higher so it has a little segment or areas of 15% grade or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| here and here but really the whole property slopes pretty well so plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| residential zoning might be beneficial rather than the RA zone just to to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| with the grade on the property but also we have the natural gas line that cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| right about through here which they have to deal with and that has a 30-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| easement around it so there's only about 50 feet from the back of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| property lines to the edge of the easement according to the plot which you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=1147)|

| 0:43:58| sensitivities of this property, that seemed appropriate. One other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| with the historic is, you mentioned the process if they were to demo the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| They're not gonna demo the house. What year was the house built? 1860.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| And the applicant has stated to us, of course anything can change, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| change their mind and they can sell the property, but the applicant has stated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2661)|

| 0:45:22| antebellum also by state law have to be approved for demolition by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| jurisdiction, so City Council would also have to approve this demolition permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Isn't that if it's built before 1865 or earlier though, right? And this is 1867.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| It was showing up, I thought, as an antebellum, but maybe it's not. If it's not, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Well it's considered antebellum, but it was built in 1867. Although there was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| addition made, so maybe the first level was built prior to that. But what I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| it's at 1867. But there are no intentions to demolish anything except a shed in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| And Lindsey did come out and review this property with the applicant a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| Jessie, I got a question. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. So it's currently R and 4. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2772)|

| 0:46:30| it at R and 4? No, but it does, if they are going to pursue something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| requires a special use, like a certain number of townhomes or multifamily units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2795)|

| 0:46:52| supports a potential special use in the future. So they're not interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| any higher, like an R and 5 or R and 6, I assume, since they're not asking for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| That was not part of this request. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240109-agenda-review?start=2823)|
