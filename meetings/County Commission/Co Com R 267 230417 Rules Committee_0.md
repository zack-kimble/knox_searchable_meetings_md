| 0:02:42| Do we have any considerations of any late additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=162.02)|
| 0:02:47| I hadn't heard of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=167.02)|
| 0:02:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=169.02)|
| 0:02:52| All right, number five, discussion and consideration of page six rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=172.02)|
| 0:02:57| section N, agenda item 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=177.02)|
| 0:03:00| regarding the discussion of zoning items at the commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=180.02)|
| 0:03:04| And you should have, Drew, did everybody get one of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=184.02)|
| 0:03:08| Should be the first one on your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=188.02)|
| 0:03:10| Mr. Frazier, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=190.02)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=193.02)|
| 0:03:14| This is in response to the discussion we continue to have at commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=194.02)|
| 0:03:18| meetings about being able to discuss zoning agenda items at work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=198.02)|
| 0:03:26| or at regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=206.02)|
| 0:03:29| And so we just wanted to clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=209.02)|
| 0:03:31| that discussion at work session meetings are for discussion purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=211.02)|
| 0:03:37| They are not to be deliberated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=217.02)|
| 0:03:39| There will be no staff present to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=219.02)|
| 0:03:42| It is specifically just if a district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=222.02)|
| 0:03:46| or an at-large commissioner would like to provide any information to the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=226.02)|
| 0:03:53| on any zoning issue or zoning item that we will be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=233.02)|
| 0:03:57| and deliberating on the following week at the regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=237.02)|
| 0:04:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=245.02)|
| 0:04:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=246.02)|
| 0:04:07| Can we incorporate some verbiage where the work session agenda has a caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=247.02)|
| 0:04:16| that we always bring under discussion that always includes the agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=256.02)|
| 0:04:23| So each month we don't have to say, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=263.02)|
| 0:04:28| we'd like to have for a discussion item zoning items 51 through 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=268.02)|
| 0:04:35| We can just have an automatic caption on the work session agenda that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=275.02)|
| 0:04:42| says discussion zoning issues or zoning items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=282.02)|
| 0:04:48| I'll look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=288.02)|
| 0:04:51| Yeah, I mean, that's just a matter of how you set your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=291.02)|
| 0:04:54| I think we did that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=294.02)|
| 0:04:56| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=296.02)|
| 0:04:57| Very similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=297.02)|
| 0:04:59| The thing that's important, and I think it's certainly strongly implied in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=299.02)|
| 0:05:05| by the language that says that it's informational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=305.02)|
| 0:05:09| and for the purpose of setting the commission agenda only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=309.02)|
| 0:05:12| and not for recommendation for the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=312.02)|
| 0:05:14| If you want to make that a little clearer, you could insert a sentence there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=314.02)|
| 0:05:18| that no vote on any zoning matter shall be taken at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=318.02)|
| 0:05:24| just to make it really clear that that's discussion only and no votes to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=324.02)|
| 0:05:29| As far as the rest, that's just a matter of how you set your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=329.02)|
| 0:05:33| if you wish to have that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=333.02)|
| 0:05:37| How did we do that last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=337.02)|
| 0:05:38| Didn't we have it as a discussion item, and it just said items number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=338.02)|
| 0:05:43| like I said, 51 through 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=343.02)|
| 0:05:46| But what we need to do then is just have that as a standardization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=346.02)|
| 0:05:51| of the work session agenda that there's a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=351.02)|
| 0:05:54| and it just lists the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=354.02)|
| 0:05:56| Well, when you have here under Roman numeral two, zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=356.02)|
| 0:06:02| you could just have zoning request discussion or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=362.02)|
| 0:06:08| and then they would automatically be available for discussion but not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=368.02)|
| 0:06:15| That's just the not voting part is the important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=375.02)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=378.02)|
| 0:06:19| So Drew can handle that internally then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=379.02)|
| 0:06:22| We don't need a formal rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=382.02)|
| 0:06:25| Not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=385.02)|
| 0:06:28| Whether you want to add something to section N that makes it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=388.02)|
| 0:06:31| that there's no votes to be taken on zoning matters is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=391.02)|
| 0:06:35| I mean, we've been good about that since we pointed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=395.02)|
| 0:06:41| So that would not have to have a vote on that, change the rule or add addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=401.02)|
| 0:06:47| Well, again, it's how you're setting your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=407.02)|
| 0:06:51| I don't think there's any rule that talks about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=411.02)|
| 0:06:55| if you just want to make that a regular discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=415.02)|
| 0:06:59| And then as far as, you know, the sentence I've proposed, that's just up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=419.02)|
| 0:07:05| Like I said, when you read it, it says it's for informational purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=425.02)|
| 0:07:07| for the setting of the agenda only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=427.02)|
| 0:07:09| and not for recommendation for the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=429.02)|
| 0:07:11| To me, that says no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=431.02)|
| 0:07:13| So, I mean, I think it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=433.02)|
| 0:07:17| You could make it more explicit by saying no vote shall be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=437.02)|
| 0:07:20| Yeah, I would like to include that if we can, that no vote will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=440.02)|
| 0:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=446.02)|
| 0:07:28| Mr. Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=448.02)|
| 0:07:31| I just want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=451.02)|
| 0:07:32| Oh, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=452.02)|
| 0:07:33| I'm the only one down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=453.02)|
| 0:07:34| Sometimes I've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=454.02)|
| 0:07:36| Well, you need to get closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=456.02)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=458.02)|
| 0:07:40| I think you could just two-fold in the language say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=460.02)|
| 0:07:44| you could just change this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=464.02)|
| 0:07:46| The zoning request should be listed on the agenda of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=466.02)|
| 0:07:51| I think you could probably just say of the agenda of the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=471.02)|
| 0:07:55| for informational purposes and for the purposes of setting the commission zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=475.02)|
| 0:07:59| and will also be included as a discussion item and no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=479.02)|
| 0:08:03| So, I think you could just change the language to say it will be a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=483.02)|
| 0:08:07| All zonings will be listed as a discussion item and no votes will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=487.02)|
| 0:08:12| We've taken work to language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=492.02)|
| 0:08:13| You guys give us your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=493.02)|
| 0:08:14| We'll put it into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=494.02)|
| 0:08:16| That would seem to clarify both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=496.02)|
| 0:08:18| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=498.02)|
| 0:08:25| Madam Chair, you got to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=505.02000000000004)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=509.02000000000004)|
| 0:08:31| Something that we had talked about previously was the fact to make sure that even though we're not voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=511.02000000000004)|
| 0:08:40| not saying I will support this or I don't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=520.02)|
| 0:08:44| I mean, technically, that's still saying how we will vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=524.02)|
| 0:08:50| even though we're not technically taking a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=530.02)|
| 0:08:52| So, I guess it's just as long as we stay away from that type of language, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=532.02)|
| 0:08:58| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=538.02)|
| 0:08:59| There's times in the discussion where I heard I'm not in favor of this or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=539.02)|
| 0:09:06| To me, that's telling you how you're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=546.02)|
| 0:09:08| We got to watch our language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=548.02)|
| 0:09:09| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=549.02)|
| 0:09:11| We have to watch our language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=551.02)|
| 0:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=553.02)|
| 0:09:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=555.02)|
| 0:09:16| But we're in a publicly called meeting where we're having discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=556.02)|
| 0:09:23| So, if you had a regular agenda item, you could say I'm in favor of that, I'm not in favor of that, if it was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=563.02)|
| 0:09:31| So, on a discussion item with a publicly called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=571.02)|
| 0:09:34| why can't the sitting commissioner for that zoning issue say I'm in favor of this, I'm not in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=574.02)|
| 0:09:42| so at least we understand what's going on and then can do additional due diligence in the following week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=582.02)|
| 0:09:50| Well, my first thought is that if I have one in District 9 and I've not spoken to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=590.02)|
| 0:10:01| but I've got a feeling that I don't want it because it's too many, too many units per acre or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=601.02)|
| 0:10:06| and I say, well, I'm not, I don't really in favor of this because of too many units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=606.02)|
| 0:10:12| They're not there to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=612.02)|
| 0:10:15| You're just giving an opinion to the 11 members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=615.02)|
| 0:10:19| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=619.02)|
| 0:10:21| I think we're treading on Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=621.02)|
| 0:10:26| These matters are supposed to be looked at publicly, and this is a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=626.02)|
| 0:10:31| The problem is if we start discussing or making recommendations either for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=631.02)|
| 0:10:37| or expressing our opinions either for or against, I think your point is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=637.02)|
| 0:10:45| People who have an interest may wish to be here, and they may wish to be heard if we're discussing their items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=645.02)|
| 0:10:54| I think if we're going to do this, and I know for a very long time we didn't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=654.02)|
| 0:10:57| I think if we're going to do this, the best possible use is just to have sort of a report about what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=657.02)|
| 0:11:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=664.02)|
| 0:11:05| This is a rezoning, the recommendation from staff is X, the recommendation, for anybody who wants to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=665.02)|
| 0:11:11| but to start expressing our opinions for or against is trotting a fairly difficult line, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=671.02)|
| 0:11:20| when you're talking about somebody's project and whether they're here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=680.02)|
| 0:11:24| This is why we do all the public notice for people for the regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=684.02)|
| 0:11:27| I mean, beyond just we're meeting in session, when there are zoning items, they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=687.02)|
| 0:11:33| signs are put up and stuff to tell people when and where to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=693.02)|
| 0:11:36| So it's probably best that those things aren't really debated even to the extent of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=696.02)|
| 0:11:41| well, I'm for this or I'm against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=701.02)|
| 0:11:45| It would be better if that were not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=705.02)|
| 0:11:47| I don't know how you articulate a rule, and I hate to put down a rule that says a commissioner can't say X, Y, or Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=707.02)|
| 0:11:54| but I think it's bad practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=714.02)|
| 0:11:58| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=718.02)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=720.02)|
| 0:12:03| I tend to agree with what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=723.02)|
| 0:12:08| I do think, though, that Commissioner Schoonmaker made a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=728.02)|
| 0:12:13| When we are discussing other matters during work session, many times we will say, well, I can't support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=733.02)|
| 0:12:23| or I do support this, and we don't necessarily at that point stop and let anyone speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=743.02)|
| 0:12:31| So, I mean, we're doing that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=751.02)|
| 0:12:35| I have no problem with what you've suggested about information only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=755.02)|
| 0:12:39| I'm just cautioning us that this is a practice we already follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=759.02)|
| 0:12:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=769.02)|
| 0:12:50| You know, I can see both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=770.02)|
| 0:12:51| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=771.02)|
| 0:12:52| But I can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=772.02)|
| 0:12:55| I'm the guy that looks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=775.02)|
| 0:12:57| I can imagine that there's somebody standing in there two weeks from now after we discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=777.02)|
| 0:13:03| and they lose and we're sued in court because they were not there to defend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=783.02)|
| 0:13:09| and they'll sue for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=789.02)|
| 0:13:11| So I'm just trying to err.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=791.02)|
| 0:13:13| I see Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=793.02)|
| 0:13:16| I agree with the proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=796.02)|
| 0:13:20| This is not just something that's on the agenda that the mayor has suggested or one of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=800.02)|
| 0:13:27| This is an applicant that is wanting this body to do a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=807.02)|
| 0:13:34| And I speak to you now not as a law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=814.02)|
| 0:13:37| but I come to you because I spent 30 years on the other side of that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=817.02)|
| 0:13:43| And I knew when I came in at the time I had to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=823.02)|
| 0:13:46| and address the county commission was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=826.02)|
| 0:13:52| That's what was noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=832.02)|
| 0:13:53| That's what the neighbors were noticed with the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=833.02)|
| 0:13:56| And that's when I think the decision was going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=836.02)|
| 0:13:58| Now, if I'm on that other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=838.02)|
| 0:14:01| and the decisions are talked about and made in a discussion session that I'm not being ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=841.02)|
| 0:14:08| I mean, I know the public notice goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=848.02)|
| 0:14:10| but nobody, applicants don't appear at that work session meeting because they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=850.02)|
| 0:14:17| And I think it's a due process issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=857.02)|
| 0:14:19| And I certainly, if they made a decision in a discussion matter at a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=859.02)|
| 0:14:25| that I wasn't there and not noticed that I needed to be there to defend my position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=865.02)|
| 0:14:30| I would take that to court as being a violation of my due process rights as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=870.02)|
| 0:14:37| So I think what Mr. Moyers has said is tread very, very cautiously on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=877.02)|
| 0:14:45| Well, I think that all 11 of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=885.02)|
| 0:14:50| or yeah, all 11 because at large can discuss the zoning item too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=890.02)|
| 0:14:55| that we be careful that we don't lead someone into a direction for the following Monday's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=895.02)|
| 0:15:03| So, you know, I can say, Commissioner, you need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=903.02)|
| 0:15:08| It would be better if you go look at this piece of property or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=908.02)|
| 0:15:13| and form your own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=913.02)|
| 0:15:16| So I think we're at a motion to change the language, right, Mr. Schoomaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=916.02)|
| 0:15:22| Did you make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=922.02)|
| 0:15:23| She made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=923.02)|
| 0:15:24| Commissioner Frazier and I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=924.02)|
| 0:15:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=929.02)|
| 0:15:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=930.02)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=931.02)|
| 0:15:32| Motion to amend the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=932.02)|
| 0:15:34| Per the law director's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=934.02)|
| 0:15:36| We have a motion on the floor to amend the language by Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=936.02)|
| 0:15:40| seconded by Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=940.02)|
| 0:15:42| Any more discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=942.02)|
| 0:15:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=945.02)|
| 0:15:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=946.02)|
| 0:15:47| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=947.02)|
| 0:15:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=949.02)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=953.02)|
| 0:15:54| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=954.02)|
| 0:15:56| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=956.02)|
| 0:16:06| Discussion and consideration of page nine, rule one or I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=966.02)|
| 0:16:10| section P consent calendar regarding education consent items pulled from the consent for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=970.02)|
| 0:16:18| I pulled that one, but I'm going to give that one to our law director to explain that we might be trading on some water there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=978.02)|
| 0:16:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=986.02)|
| 0:16:27| To go back to what we discussed at the commission retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=987.02)|
| 0:16:32| the reason we have the education consent calendar arises out of the litigation that happened between the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=992.02)|
| 0:16:37| and the county back in 2000, 2001, whenever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=997.02)|
| 0:16:44| And what came out of that was the fact is, and this applies really to every county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1004.02)|
| 0:16:50| the authority of the county commission is to set the overall budget of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1010.02)|
| 0:16:53| and to set the broad budgetary categories for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1013.02)|
| 0:17:00| But after that, the school board is empowered by state law to spend its money however it sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1020.02)|
| 0:17:08| So what was happening before and one of the things that led to the litigation was the county commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1028.02)|
| 0:17:14| the old commission, the 19-member commission would have these education meetings and finance meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1034.02)|
| 0:17:19| and they would bring the school people down here and grill them about every matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1039.02)|
| 0:17:23| and they would regularly turn down things that they really had no authority to turn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1043.02)|
| 0:17:28| And so one of the things that came out of that litigation was the education consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1048.02)|
| 0:17:35| The reason we have it is because our county charter says that the commission must approve all contracts over a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1055.02)|
| 0:17:42| I think in the charter it's 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1062.02)|
| 0:17:44| I think we may have raised it to 100 by ordinance at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1064.02)|
| 0:17:49| But in any event, the commission has to sign off and the county mayor has to sign off on every contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1069.02)|
| 0:17:56| So to make these two things work together, we created the education consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1076.02)|
| 0:18:04| The commission's approval of school budgetary items is basically intended to be a very pro forma matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1084.02)|
| 0:18:12| to comply with the provisions of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1092.02)|
| 0:18:15| It's not intended to be something where we get engaged in deep discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1095.02)|
| 0:18:21| Again, I know the commission likes to know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1101.02)|
| 0:18:24| and I don't think that the outcome of the litigation prohibits you from discussing matters that are on the education consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1104.02)|
| 0:18:32| although I think most of the time it's ill-advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1112.02)|
| 0:18:36| But it's not prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1116.02)|
| 0:18:40| But what is prohibited is turning down items that are on that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1120.02)|
| 0:18:45| We have no authority to tell the school board they cannot use the money that we've granted them to sign a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1125.02)|
| 0:18:54| whether we agree with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1134.02)|
| 0:18:56| And so I have noticed that from time to time matters are being taken off of the education consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1136.02)|
| 0:19:05| for the purpose of discussion at the workshop meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1145.02)|
| 0:19:08| My concern is if you follow your normal process, you would then vote for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1148.02)|
| 0:19:14| What I'm suggesting is that we use language somewhat similar to the zoning language that we were just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1154.02)|
| 0:19:21| and say that if a matter is pulled for discussion from the education consent agenda, it will be re-added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1161.02)|
| 0:19:30| There will be no vote taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1170.02)|
| 0:19:31| It's for discussion and informational purposes only, and it will be re-added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1171.02)|
| 0:19:35| And Jill's got some language, I think, that will accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1175.02)|
| 0:19:38| Jill, do you want to read that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1178.02)|
| 0:19:43| To just add a sentence that says any item on the education consent calendar that's pulled for discussion at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1183.02)|
| 0:19:49| shall remain on the education consent calendar for the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1189.02)|
| 0:19:54| And that would make it just explicit that we're not voting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1194.02)|
| 0:20:00| because my concern would be if one person passes or votes no, then it doesn't go on education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1200.02)|
| 0:20:07| Then we're having a full discussion and vote at commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1207.02)|
| 0:20:10| And that violates the court order that resulted from that litigation all those years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1210.02)|
| 0:20:16| and that we're still under, and they're still under, which is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1216.02)|
| 0:20:20| It's kept peace for the last 20 years, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1220.02)|
| 0:20:26| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1226.02)|
| 0:20:28| So in other words, for the work session agenda, if the chair, somebody wants to pull number 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1228.02)|
| 0:20:35| that's under the education consent, the chair would say we're pulling item number 15 to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1235.02)|
| 0:20:41| but would not ask for a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1241.02)|
| 0:20:44| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1244.02)|
| 0:20:45| So that's the procedure of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1245.02)|
| 0:20:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1247.02)|
| 0:20:48| If there's a discussion, you know, you can ask questions, whatever, try to get them answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1248.02)|
| 0:20:51| But at the end of the discussion, anything, just like a zoning matter, is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1251.02)|
| 0:20:55| Then you go on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1255.02)|
| 0:20:57| No vote to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1257.02)|
| 0:21:01| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1261.02)|
| 0:21:03| If I pull school consent, school calendar item 12, and they say, well, I'll have to get back with you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1263.02)|
| 0:21:14| It's really not on consent, but it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1274.02)|
| 0:21:17| So we still take it the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1277.02)|
| 0:21:19| It's on consent because, again, if you pull it off, let's say we had an item tonight on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1279.02)|
| 0:21:26| and you say, well, I'd like to hear from the superintendent on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1286.02)|
| 0:21:30| The superintendent isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1290.02)|
| 0:21:33| It's still on consent because the fact is you don't have the right to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1293.02)|
| 0:21:38| The only reason these are even on your agenda at all is because of the charter provision that says commission must approve all contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1298.02)|
| 0:21:45| over a certain amount and that the county mayor has to sign off on all contracts in the name of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1305.02)|
| 0:21:53| So we've got some state law that mandate one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1313.02)|
| 0:21:58| We've got some charter provisions that mandate another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1318.02)|
| 0:22:01| What came out of that litigation was how do we harmonize these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1321.02)|
| 0:22:05| We don't want to say that one overrules the other where we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1325.02)|
| 0:22:10| And so what came out of that was, okay, it goes on the commission agenda for approval because that's what the charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1330.02)|
| 0:22:17| but because we have no right to say no, it goes on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1337.02)|
| 0:22:22| And so pulling it off, I mean, it's for your own curiosity, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1342.02)|
| 0:22:27| because at the end of the day you don't have any legal authority to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1347.02)|
| 0:22:31| There's almost no reason even to pull one off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1351.02)|
| 0:22:34| If you have a question about it, it's just as easy to pick up the phone and call John Riseman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1354.02)|
| 0:22:38| A full commission agenda of an item that you can't say no to is, say, a waste of time, but you have no choice but to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1358.02)|
| 0:22:53| I understand, and the Carnes, I'll give you a good example that something that needed to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1373.02)|
| 0:23:00| was the Carnes Culinary Building that money was approved for it and never paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1380.02)|
| 0:23:07| and it kind of was going to be snuck under, and it was pulled out, and we found out we had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1387.02)|
| 0:23:13| they used the money that was supposed to went to the building to build a culinary part of the Carnes High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1393.02)|
| 0:23:20| They used it for something else, and so they had to come and get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1400.02)|
| 0:23:24| So that needed to be brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1404.02)|
| 0:23:26| Yeah, I mean, if they move money, and I don't know the circumstance you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1406.02)|
| 0:23:30| if they move money between budgetary categories, they have to have authority for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1410.02)|
| 0:23:34| Okay, so if you give them a million dollars for capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1414.02)|
| 0:23:37| and they decide to take that million dollars and put it in teacher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1417.02)|
| 0:23:40| that's something they would have to come back and ask for authority to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1420.02)|
| 0:23:45| But if they ask for a million dollars in budgetary authority for capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1425.02)|
| 0:23:50| and you think they're going to spend it on Carnes and spend it on Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1430.02)|
| 0:23:53| that's within their authority to do, and I don't think the commission can say no to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1433.02)|
| 0:23:59| All right, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1439.02)|
| 0:24:02| Would it best serve us if we just add on the agenda discussion of education consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1442.02)|
| 0:24:08| Well, Jill has got a—I think Jill solved the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1448.02)|
| 0:24:16| The language that Jill read in a minute ago takes care of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1456.02)|
| 0:24:19| I think if you add an agenda item for discussion of education consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1459.02)|
| 0:24:23| it almost encourages people to discuss all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1463.02)|
| 0:24:27| In most cases, unless there's something that's really, really screwy looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1467.02)|
| 0:24:32| there should not be any need to discuss because that's what we have a school board for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1472.02)|
| 0:24:38| They make these decisions within the budgetary authority given by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1478.02)|
| 0:24:43| That's how these two bodies interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1483.02)|
| 0:24:49| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1489.02)|
| 0:24:51| I, two or three times, have asked to have things pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1491.02)|
| 0:24:55| but it's been because I've been so excited about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1495.02)|
| 0:25:00| that I wanted the commission to know that the schools were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1500.02)|
| 0:25:05| I would hate to totally lose that ability to have them be able to shine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1505.02)|
| 0:25:09| I think you have the right to do that, just no farther,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1509.02)|
| 0:25:14| and that's the only thing I'm trying to make sure that if something does get pulled off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1514.02)|
| 0:25:19| for whatever reason, that we don't end up voting on it at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1519.02)|
| 0:25:25| because that could end up the way our workshop rules go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1525.02)|
| 0:25:28| giving us a problem with the regular commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1528.02)|
| 0:25:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1533.02)|
| 0:25:34| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1534.02)|

| 0:26:16| I think we discussed that last year or last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1576.02)|
| 0:26:20| Back in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1580.02)|
| 0:26:23| Did I miss seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1583.02)|

| 0:26:32| So we are on number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1592.02)|

| 0:26:40| Then I've got the wrong agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1600.02)|
| 0:26:42| Let me find another agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1602.02)|
| 0:26:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1616.02)|
| 0:26:57| I printed off the previous agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1617.02)|
| 0:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1620.02)|
| 0:27:01| Item seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1621.02)|
| 0:27:02| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1622.02)|
| 0:27:03| Discussion and consideration of page 13, rule five committees regarding commission chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1623.02)|
| 0:27:07| serving on the other boards and committee as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1627.02)|
| 0:27:11| That is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1631.02)|
| 0:27:15| I thought that were in our rules that the chair of Knox County could not serve as a chair of a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1635.02)|
| 0:27:24| And come to find out, it is a standing committee only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1644.02)|
| 0:27:28| My concern is that the chair that can appoint or say an ad hoc or say a special committee is formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1648.02)|
| 0:27:41| and the chair, a strong chair, I mean a really strong chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1661.02)|
| 0:27:47| can get enough members on that board to where they are elected chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1667.02)|
| 0:27:52| where then that chair, as chair, they guide the whole discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1672.02)|
| 0:27:57| So I don't, for the future, not, for the future of us 11 or the future 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1677.02)|
| 0:28:06| that the chair of Knox County Commission should not, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1686.02)|
| 0:28:10| serve as chair on any boards or committees except for the ones that are listed in the Knox ID board and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1690.02)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1702.02)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1704.02)|
| 0:28:25| So this would be effective September 1st of 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1705.02)|
| 0:28:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1708.02)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1709.02)|
| 0:28:31| And anybody, Madam Chair is the chair of the personnel committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1711.02)|
| 0:28:36| As long as personnel committee, I don't know, is this an ongoing committee, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1716.02)|
| 0:28:45| Until there's another election, Madam Chair will serve as chair of that until another election, if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1725.02)|
| 0:28:52| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1732.02)|
| 0:28:54| The chair is a member of the personnel committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1734.02)|
| 0:28:58| and so if I were to not be chair come September 1st, I would not be on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1738.02)|
| 0:29:06| The four other members serve for two-year terms, and the chair serves as long as they're chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1746.02)|
| 0:29:15| As their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1755.02)|
| 0:29:17| Their term as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1757.02)|
| 0:29:19| Well, then September 1st, that would take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1759.02)|
| 0:29:22| We put in the language that Knox County chair cannot serve as chair on any committee or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1762.02)|
| 0:29:29| That will take care of it as if unless you are re-elected as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1769.02)|
| 0:29:37| Make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1777.02)|
| 0:29:40| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1780.02)|
| 0:29:42| So you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1782.02)|
| 0:29:44| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1784.02)|
| 0:29:47| I'm trying to follow Robertson's orders myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1787.02)|
| 0:29:50| Mr. Frazier, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1790.02)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1792.02)|
| 0:29:53| I just had a question for anyone who served as chair previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1793.02)|
| 0:29:56| I know Commissioner Jay has served as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1796.02)|
| 0:29:59| Did you serve on any boards, Commissioner Jay, where you were the chair or committees where you were the chair as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1799.02)|
| 0:30:09| I'm trying to figure out what problem are we trying to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1809.02)|
| 0:30:12| Has it created an issue or concern in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1812.02)|
| 0:30:19| I'm trying to just think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1819.02)|
| 0:30:24| I had a special called committee, but that was a temporary special called committee, so it wasn't a standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1824.02)|
| 0:30:31| I mean, it wasn't a committee that would last in perpetuity like the personnel committee or other committees standing or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1831.02)|
| 0:30:41| And then external boards, IDB, NOxED, things like that, that wouldn't be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1841.02)|
| 0:30:48| So I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1848.02)|
| 0:30:52| I think the intention of where Commissioner Daley is coming from is we've added a new committee that is a personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1852.02)|
| 0:31:01| I mean, the personnel committee is, I've never heard of it as being temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1861.02)|
| 0:31:09| You know, there's standing and then there's non-standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1869.02)|
| 0:31:12| And it was formed, but it wasn't formed as like a standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1872.02)|
| 0:31:17| It was formed as a non-standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1877.02)|
| 0:31:19| And so it's sort of over here by itself where I'm not exactly sure that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1879.02)|
| 0:31:24| I can't remember the discussion and the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1884.02)|
| 0:31:27| Maybe that could be filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1887.02)|
| 0:31:29| I think if I understand Commissioner Daley's concern is that we've got sort of a permanent committee that is not under the rules of every other committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1889.02)|
| 0:31:40| which would not allow the chair to be both the chair of commission and the chair of a regular committee order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1900.02)|
| 0:31:47| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1907.02)|
| 0:31:48| Accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1908.02)|
| 0:31:49| But I wasn't, when I was chair, I was not chair of any other committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1909.02)|
| 0:31:54| In fact, when it came around, somebody nominated me for something to chair, and we all said, no, no, I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1914.02)|
| 0:32:01| So I think the issue is we just have this outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1921.02)|
| 0:32:04| So I guess the question I would say is why, does anybody remember the discussion of why the personnel committee was not set up as a standing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1924.02)|
| 0:32:12| which is like finance committee and all these other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1932.02)|
| 0:32:15| I would defer to Madam Chair on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1935.02)|
| 0:32:20| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1940.02)|
| 0:32:22| It's because we have a non-commissioned member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1942.02)|
| 0:32:28| Stephanie Candler, the Human Resources Director, is a non-voting member of the personnel committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1948.02)|
| 0:32:34| Standing committees only are, per our rules, standing committees are commission-only committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1954.02)|
| 0:32:42| Okay, so audit committee would not be a standing committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1962.02)|
| 0:32:46| Because that has non-commissioned members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1966.02)|
| 0:32:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1969.02)|
| 0:32:50| Okay, so that's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1970.02)|
| 0:32:51| There are only five standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1971.02)|
| 0:32:53| I dare not ask why that was set up in the first place, because God knows when it was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1973.02)|
| 0:33:00| Long before any of us, I imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1980.02)|
| 0:33:05| Ms. Fraser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1985.02)|
| 0:33:06| As I said, that may answer the question of the personnel committee really isn't kind of a committee that's just hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1986.02)|
| 0:33:15| It follows the other committee structures that have non-commissioned members, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=1995.02)|
| 0:33:24| I think also, if I recall correctly, I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2004.02)|
| 0:33:27| but I believe that membership on the personnel committee is a two-year appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2007.02)|
| 0:33:31| and understanding committees are appointed annually, so that's a second difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2011.02)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Kuenbaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2018.02)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2019.02)|
| 0:33:41| I think historically, because the chairperson has had so much responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2021.02)|
| 0:33:48| with all these outside requirements as chair of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2028.02)|
| 0:33:53| what they were trying to do in a lot of cases, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2033.02)|
| 0:33:56| was to allow other members who aren't chair or vice chair to have the opportunity to serve as a chair of a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2036.02)|
| 0:34:06| That's why you don't have the chairman chair of all the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2046.02)|
| 0:34:12| Really, you can ask Larson that the amount of outside events that he had to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2052.02)|
| 0:34:20| and committees that he was responsible for as the chairperson of the commission, it's pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2060.02)|
| 0:34:27| So I think the intent was no chairman could be the chairman of a committee was for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2067.02)|
| 0:34:42| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2082.02)|
| 0:34:45| I still, you know, I'm looking towards the future that maybe we don't have a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2085.02)|
| 0:34:54| but I'm telling you, in the future, we could have a problem with a very, very strong chairperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2094.02)|
| 0:35:01| They may have an issue that they're focused on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2101.02)|
| 0:35:05| and they set up a special committee to look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2105.02)|
| 0:35:10| and those five people elect that chair as the chair of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2110.02)|
| 0:35:16| and that chair can guide that in any direction they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2116.02)|
| 0:35:21| The chair is a very strong position, very, very strong position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2121.02)|
| 0:35:26| and Mr. Law Director, can the chair set up a special committee just by appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2126.02)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, Jill points out to me that it's section H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2152.02)|
| 0:35:56| The chair may from time to time appoint a special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee as the circumstances require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2156.02)|
| 0:36:04| but such a special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee shall be disbanded when it completes its assigned work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2164.02)|
| 0:36:09| and in no case shall it exist longer than one year unless extended by resolution of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2169.02)|
| 0:36:16| No special committee, task force, or ad hoc committee should be appointed for any purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2176.02)|
| 0:36:20| when there's a standing committee on the same side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2180.02)|
| 0:36:23| So, temporarily, they could do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2183.02)|
| 0:36:28| Temporary. Has it ever happened? Probably not. Could it happen? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2188.02)|
| 0:36:32| Yes, it did. Mr. Chairman, when I was chair, I set up a special committee to review possible reforms of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2192.02)|
| 0:36:41| It was for a temporary purpose. It lasted four months, give or take, and disbanded when we completed the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2201.02)|
| 0:36:50| and it was for a very specific purpose, and then it did its work, and then it came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2210.02)|
| 0:36:56| and a certain amount of recommendations went to commission, and then the committee itself disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2216.02)|
| 0:37:02| I didn't want to bring that up, but I'm glad you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2222.02)|
| 0:37:08| It was part of the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2228.02)|
| 0:37:16| I think, if I could, Mr. Chair, I think without some specific language or something that specifically helps address a future problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2236.02)|
| 0:37:28| I think everybody's struggling. I understand your concept, and we often work on rules that are not necessarily going to pertain to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2248.02)|
| 0:37:36| but future commissions, but I think everybody's struggling to figure out, like Commissioner Fraser said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2256.02)|
| 0:37:42| what are we fixing, and is there some very specific language that helps address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2262.02)|
| 0:37:49| I mean, if you want to propose that no commission chair serve as the chair of any committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2269.02)|
| 0:37:58| then that's a very specific action, but I don't think we've determined that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2278.02)|
| 0:38:03| Ultimately, we have a chair election every year, so I can play the other side of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2283.02)|
| 0:38:09| which is if for some reason you had a chair that was very authoritarian and very controlling and had lots of votes and lots of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2289.02)|
| 0:38:18| then you ultimately could change the chair within 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2298.02)|
| 0:38:22| So we have lots of checks and balances to make sure somebody doesn't hold essentially too much power at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2302.02)|
| 0:38:31| Ultimately, the chair is more the parliamentarian and the organizer and the coordinator of many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2311.02)|
| 0:38:38| than the decision maker when it comes to policy, but I think that's why we're struggling, if I can sum it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2318.02)|
| 0:38:47| I will – if it's okay, I will sit down and discuss with the law director and see if this should move forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2327.02)|
| 0:38:58| So if it is, it will be on the next agenda. If not, it won't be on the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2338.02)|
| 0:39:03| All right. Number eight, correct, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2343.02)|
| 0:39:07| Discussion and consideration, page 15, rule section K, beer board, order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2347.02)|
| 0:39:14| Is it necessary – again, this is for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2354.02)|
| 0:39:19| We're going to have probably five new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2359.02)|
| 0:39:24| Do we need an order of business for the beer board like we do in zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2364.02)|
| 0:39:28| It says, you know, this is first, second, third, fourth, fifth, like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2368.02)|
| 0:39:33| So we will have an order in our rules, in our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2373.02)|
| 0:39:39| That's why I brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2379.02)|
| 0:39:40| We don't have – at this point in time, if you'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2380.02)|
| 0:39:53| Yeah, just an agenda, an agenda like we have in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2393.02)|
| 0:39:59| Mr. Kuhnbaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2399.02)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2400.02)|
| 0:40:02| Yeah, and I think that would help the clerk's office because sometimes we put the suspensions and revocations first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2402.02)|
| 0:40:10| and then you have the folks that are here just for a new beer license sitting in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2410.02)|
| 0:40:16| where if that was reversed and it was actually in a format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2416.02)|
| 0:40:20| because we should be taking the people here for beer licenses that haven't had a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2420.02)|
| 0:40:26| and then do the revocations and suspensions after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2426.02)|
| 0:40:32| But right now we have no – the clerk can do whichever way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2432.02)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2437.02)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2439.02)|
| 0:40:40| I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2440.02)|
| 0:40:41| We've spent a lot of time over the last four or five years doing everything from defining what is the role of the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2441.02)|
| 0:40:48| the vice chair, doing a lot of documentation of defining, you know, roles and responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2448.02)|
| 0:40:54| changing our work – I mean changing how we do our agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2454.02)|
| 0:40:58| I think it's a good idea to – anything we can do to clarify, clean it up, put it in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2458.02)|
| 0:41:03| and make it easier for the next commission, I'm all for because it's been a bit of a loose mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2463.02)|
| 0:41:11| and we've really done a good job of kind of tightening it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2471.02)|
| 0:41:14| So I'd say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2474.02)|
| 0:41:17| Mr. Law Director, can we do this or do we have to have it in a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2477.02)|
| 0:41:21| I mean –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2481.02)|
| 0:41:23| I mean without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2483.02)|
| 0:41:25| Well, I mean I think if you pass a motion asking that we codify basically an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2485.02)|
| 0:41:34| or order of business for the beer board, we can certainly put one together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2494.02)|
| 0:41:38| And if you want the new applications to come before the disciplinary actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2498.02)|
| 0:41:44| just let us know and we'll do it in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2504.02)|
| 0:41:50| Does the Rules Committee agree that applications should come before any suspensions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2510.02)|
| 0:41:56| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2516.02)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2518.02)|
| 0:41:59| Then I'm going to make a motion that we ask the law department to come up with an agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2519.02)|
| 0:42:04| for the beer board with applications being first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2524.02)|
| 0:42:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2528.02)|
| 0:42:10| All right, I have a motion by the chair, second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2530.02)|
| 0:42:14| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2534.02)|
| 0:42:21| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2541.02)|
| 0:42:24| Yeah, because we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2544.02)|
| 0:42:26| If we need to change something, we can discuss it or change it if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2546.02)|
| 0:42:30| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2550.02)|
| 0:42:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2552.02)|
| 0:42:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2553.02)|
| 0:42:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2555.02)|
| 0:42:36| All opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2556.02)|
| 0:42:38| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2558.02)|
| 0:42:48| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2568.02)|
| 0:42:50| Just as a side note, it's going to have to come to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2570.02)|
| 0:42:57| Number nine, discussion and consideration on page 18, outside conferences and travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2577.02)|
| 0:43:03| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2583.02)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2586.02)|
| 0:43:08| And, of course, everybody knows that the chair of county commission has the oversight over the travel budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2588.02)|
| 0:43:14| and can decide how that's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2594.02)|
| 0:43:17| In the past, I've looked at how other counties in Tennessee handle their travel budgets for the ones that have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2597.02)|
| 0:43:24| And one that I guess I kind of admired was Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2604.02)|
| 0:43:30| And what they do is they have, and let's just say for round numbers, if we have a $22,000 travel budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2610.02)|
| 0:43:39| that is $2,000 per commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2619.02)|
| 0:43:42| And the way they work it is if, for instance, let's just say Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2622.02)|
| 0:43:51| have used up their $2,000 worth of travel budget and Commissioner Lee still has $1,000 in her account, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2631.02)|
| 0:44:04| and Commissioner Hill and Jay want to go to a conference in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2644.02)|
| 0:44:10| Commissioner Lee could say, hey, I'll take $500 out of my travel and give it to Hill and to Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2650.02)|
| 0:44:18| So that way, and also with a set amount designated for each commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2658.02)|
| 0:44:25| you don't have, say, two or three commissioners using up the total fund for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2665.02)|
| 0:44:31| This way, it's a uniform, you don't actually get paid, you know, you don't have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2671.02)|
| 0:44:38| but it's just in record that you get this amount for travel and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2678.02)|
| 0:44:45| decide how you're going to spend it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2685.02)|
| 0:44:48| But if two or three commissioners don't ever want to go to a conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2688.02)|
| 0:44:52| don't ever want to go to County Government Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2692.02)|
| 0:44:54| then they could allocate those funds to the commissioners who do want to go to those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2694.02)|
| 0:45:02| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2702.02)|
| 0:45:04| And I'd be glad to get the language together based on how other counties do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2704.02)|
| 0:45:10| if you're interested in going forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2710.02)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2714.02)|
| 0:45:15| I guess I would go back to the question that Commissioner Frazier did in the last issue that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2715.02)|
| 0:45:24| Is that, in fact, a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2724.02)|
| 0:45:27| Is this a problem that we've had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2727.02)|
| 0:45:32| I don't know, because I think we've had to add to our budget over the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2732.02)|
| 0:45:38| because more commissioners are now going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2738.02)|
| 0:45:43| But, again, it would just be more of an equitable, everybody gets the exact same amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2743.02)|
| 0:45:50| and then if it needs to be adjusted, you can adjust it internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2750.02)|
| 0:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2757.02)|
| 0:45:58| The potential problem with that might be these commissioners that choose not to travel at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2758.02)|
| 0:46:12| then does it become a mad dash for the other commissioners to go and say, I want your $2,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2772.02)|
| 0:46:20| I mean, I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2780.02)|
| 0:46:23| If you're going to piece it out per person like that, that could potentially just create...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2783.02)|
| 0:46:30| Well, you could also have three commissioners use the entire budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2790.02)|
| 0:46:35| and then people who want to go to County Government Day can't go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2795.02)|
| 0:46:39| or to the legislative conference in May can't go because it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2799.02)|
| 0:46:43| So to your knowledge, has any commissioner been told they could not go to a conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2803.02)|
| 0:46:48| No, they've not been told, but the budget had to be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2808.02)|
| 0:46:51| Had to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2811.02)|
| 0:46:52| Adjusted outward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2812.02)|
| 0:46:53| So if you've been on commission longer than any of us, is that a frequent occurrence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2813.02)|
| 0:47:00| Well, previously we only had three commissioners who went to conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2820.02)|
| 0:47:04| Now we've got close to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2824.02)|
| 0:47:07| So the budget's had to go up to accommodate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2827.02)|
| 0:47:11| But if you've got nine out of 11 that want to go to a conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2831.02)|
| 0:47:16| and, let's say, they're not local, they're in Hawaii or Seattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2836.02)|
| 0:47:22| wherever it is, it's going to cost more money, and that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2842.02)|
| 0:47:25| You can run into an issue where three people or four people can wipe out the entire budget by going to two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2845.02)|
| 0:47:35| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2855.02)|
| 0:47:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2857.02)|
| 0:47:40| The chair has a lot of leeway and discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2860.02)|
| 0:47:44| and I'm not aware of anybody who's ever been turned down to go to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2864.02)|
| 0:47:49| The budget has been amended, but I'll just remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2869.02)|
| 0:47:54| the reason the budget has to be amended at time to time was, I think, prior to, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2874.02)|
| 0:48:02| I was elected first in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2882.02)|
| 0:48:04| In the years 2015, 16, and 17, the commission budget was cut to, like, the bare bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2884.02)|
| 0:48:10| We didn't even have meals to help commissioners that were here for 10 or 12 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2890.02)|
| 0:48:15| much less office supplies, much less, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2895.02)|
| 0:48:18| we had the dumpiest conference room and office in the entire building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2898.02)|
| 0:48:22| and, you know, Drusilla didn't have, like, a bottle of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2902.02)|
| 0:48:25| You know, it was just slashed and burned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2905.02)|
| 0:48:29| and only when we sort of realized we had to bring the commission office into the modern age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2909.02)|
| 0:48:34| did we go and basically ask for more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2914.02)|
| 0:48:37| and the finance department was more than happy to accommodate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2917.02)|
| 0:48:40| and I think ever since has been able to say, look, what's an appropriate budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2920.02)|
| 0:48:44| I personally think it's great that more commissioners are going to these conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2924.02)|
| 0:48:48| and I think the chair can certainly advocate for more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2928.02)|
| 0:48:52| and as we go through the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2932.02)|
| 0:48:55| maybe more modernize the budget even more to say what is more appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2935.02)|
| 0:49:00| because we do have commissioners going to NACO conferences, which is pretty rare, but growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2940.02)|
| 0:49:06| The commissioner conferences are getting more popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2946.02)|
| 0:49:09| so I think we should ‑‑ I don't see a rule change here that fixes much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2949.02)|
| 0:49:13| other than we should maybe work on our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2953.02)|
| 0:49:16| and let the chair support everybody as best they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2956.02)|
| 0:49:20| but I don't ‑‑ I'm not sure I see a problem fixing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2960.02)|
| 0:49:24| and if we go through that, then I'm going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2964.02)|
| 0:49:27| we're all lobbying each other to give each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2967.02)|
| 0:49:29| hey, maybe you don't want to go to that conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2969.02)|
| 0:49:31| Give me your ‑‑ I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2971.02)|
| 0:49:33| It just occurred to me that I think we should just amend the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2973.02)|
| 0:49:36| and get some more resources to participate, so that's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2976.02)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2981.02)|
| 0:49:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2984.02)|
| 0:49:45| Just to echo what Commissioner Jay said, he kind of took everything I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2985.02)|
| 0:49:49| I think this is more of a budget issue that we need to look at internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2989.02)|
| 0:49:53| and go from there, because I don't want to deter anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2993.02)|
| 0:49:59| from obtaining additional information or education or resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=2999.02)|
| 0:50:03| and, you know, I would like to go to, you know, lots of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3003.02)|
| 0:50:10| but I don't want to hinder anyone else from being able to go as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3010.02)|
| 0:50:14| so I really think that we can look at this like Commissioner Jay said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3014.02)|
| 0:50:17| and modernize the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3017.02)|
| 0:50:19| I think we've got, as I've said before, a more community‑minded body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3019.02)|
| 0:50:24| than we've seen in a long time, and we're willing and ready and able to do more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3024.02)|
| 0:50:30| so I think we should just look at that, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3030.02)|
| 0:50:36| Commissioner Shoemaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3036.02)|
| 0:50:39| Have you been recognized first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3039.02)|
| 0:50:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3042.02)|
| 0:50:44| I just have a comment in hearing what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3044.02)|
| 0:50:51| If we were going to put restrictions at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3051.02)|
| 0:50:56| and I caution myself even saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3056.02)|
| 0:50:58| but perhaps limiting out‑of‑state travel to not more than one a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3058.02)|
| 0:51:06| with special permission of the chair for a second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3066.02)|
| 0:51:11| or something like that that, you know, would keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3071.02)|
| 0:51:17| if we have a propensity to have a commission or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3077.02)|
| 0:51:21| that want to go all over the country four or five times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3081.02)|
| 0:51:25| that might help that if you all even think something like that is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3085.02)|
| 0:51:31| but that would at least then offer some type of a stop gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3091.02)|
| 0:51:37| but not close any door either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3097.02)|
| 0:51:43| Madam Chair, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3103.02)|
| 0:51:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3105.02)|
| 0:51:47| Commissioner Hill, out‑of‑state travel has to be approved by the chair anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3107.02)|
| 0:51:56| The out‑of‑state travel is very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3116.02)|
| 0:52:00| You know, it could be upwards to $5,000 just for one trip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3120.02)|
| 0:52:03| which eats into the budget in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3123.02)|
| 0:52:06| I guess the best thing that we need to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3126.02)|
| 0:52:10| we're probably too late this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3130.02)|
| 0:52:12| but next year, have a list, say, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3132.02)|
| 0:52:15| where are you planning on going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3135.02)|
| 0:52:18| So, Drew will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3138.02)|
| 0:52:20| She knows about what it costs per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3140.02)|
| 0:52:22| so we can get that budget to where we don't have to go back and amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3142.02)|
| 0:52:28| Commissioner McMaker, if you want to research that more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3148.02)|
| 0:52:31| do that for me, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3151.02)|
| 0:52:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3154.02)|
| 0:52:35| Number 10, discussion and consideration on page 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3155.02)|
| 0:52:40| number of procedure regarding reporting a planning commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3160.02)|
| 0:52:46| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3166.02)|
| 0:52:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3167.02)|
| 0:52:51| It would be beneficial for the person that's appearing from NOx planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3171.02)|
| 0:52:57| to be one of the senior planners as opposed to the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3177.02)|
| 0:53:03| I would prefer to hear information and have that person on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3183.02)|
| 0:53:08| who's a senior planner as opposed to actually works the nuts and bolts of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3188.02)|
| 0:53:16| as opposed to just the executive director coming and reading the verbiage in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3196.02)|
| 0:53:25| To me, that doesn't do us, there's no benefit to us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3205.02)|
| 0:53:31| And when we say on number five, a staff representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3211.02)|
| 0:53:35| that's never really been spelled out, what is a staff representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3215.02)|
| 0:53:42| So this is for the thought process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3222.02)|
| 0:53:48| So what is your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3228.02)|
| 0:53:50| Well, I was going to let Mr. Chair, if you'll defer to Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3230.02)|
| 0:53:55| I'll hear what she has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3235.02)|
| 0:53:57| Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3237.02)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3238.02)|
| 0:53:59| I would agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3239.02)|
| 0:54:01| It is extremely helpful when we do have senior planning staff present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3241.02)|
| 0:54:05| and can answer questions when they've been actually working on the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3245.02)|
| 0:54:10| I think it's something that we should probably have a discussion with Planning Commission and staff first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3250.02)|
| 0:54:15| before we change our rules and get their input and guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3255.02)|
| 0:54:20| just because it is impacting their staff and their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3260.02)|
| 0:54:23| But I agree it is extremely beneficial and helpful to me to have this senior staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3263.02)|
| 0:54:29| and senior planners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3269.02)|
| 0:54:31| But I think we should take it back to Planning Commission and talk to them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3271.02)|
| 0:54:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3278.02)|
| 0:54:41| Mr. Schoonmaker, would you be willing to go to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3281.02)|
| 0:54:44| and ask them if they would bring it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3284.02)|
| 0:54:48| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3288.02)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3289.02)|
| 0:54:51| And then we'll have Jill write it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3291.02)|
| 0:54:56| Number 11, discussion and consideration on page 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3296.02)|
| 0:54:59| application postponements and withdrawals on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3299.02)|
| 0:55:02| Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3302.02)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3304.02)|
| 0:55:05| Again, this is something that's come up several times during our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3305.02)|
| 0:55:09| and it's just a process that I don't think we've actually been following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3309.02)|
| 0:55:13| and that's when we do have an applicant who asks for a withdrawal or deferral at the zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3313.02)|
| 0:55:20| According to our rules, if they do request a withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3320.02)|
| 0:55:25| then the matter should be considered a denial if they don't follow proper process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3325.02)|
| 0:55:30| and submit a request to postpone or withdraw by a certain time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3330.02)|
| 0:55:36| So I wanted to bring that to the body's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3336.02)|
| 0:55:40| and ask is that something that we need to further clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3340.02)|
| 0:55:43| Is that something that the body would like to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3343.02)|
| 0:55:47| But it's something that currently we're not following regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3347.02)|
| 0:55:52| So I just wanted to get people's input and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3352.02)|
| 0:56:01| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3361.02)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3362.02)|
| 0:56:03| I think like any great rule, no matter how we write it, somebody's going to have a workaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3363.02)|
| 0:56:10| If I was an applicant and I didn't get my deferral in in time in my rules, I just wouldn't show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3370.02)|
| 0:56:17| because the rules say a no-show is an automatic 30-day deferral as a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3377.02)|
| 0:56:24| So I mean I think there's always going to be a workaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3384.02)|
| 0:56:30| The hardest part is as stuff comes up who I think tracking like, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3390.02)|
| 0:56:38| I'm trying to think of a recent circumstance where they may have come in and asked for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3398.02)|
| 0:56:43| We haven't had one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3403.02)|
| 0:56:44| So the whole point of this was originally we had people that sort of read the tea leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3404.02)|
| 0:56:49| saw they were going to lose the vote, and then last minute pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3409.02)|
| 0:56:52| And we were trying to present this was the fix to keep people from bailing at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3412.02)|
| 0:56:58| when everybody's shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3418.02)|
| 0:57:00| So are we just not enforcing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3420.02)|
| 0:57:02| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3422.02)|
| 0:57:05| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3425.02)|
| 0:57:07| We've had instances where applicants have come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3427.02)|
| 0:57:10| and actually asked the commissioner maybe to put forth a withdrawal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3430.02)|
| 0:57:15| or say the applicant has asked to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3435.02)|
| 0:57:19| And per our rules, the matter should be considered a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3439.02)|
| 0:57:25| if it did not follow the correct submittal process for a postponement, deferral, or withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3445.02)|
| 0:57:35| Yeah, I think you should weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3455.02)|
| 0:57:38| Mr. Jay, the Tazewell Pike, I'll talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3458.02)|
| 0:57:43| Tazewell Pike was one that he wanted to defer and he couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3463.02)|
| 0:57:48| It would be considered a denial, so we changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3468.02)|
| 0:57:52| Madam Chair made the motion to defer for 30 days so he wouldn't be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3472.02)|
| 0:57:58| Then Commissioner Beeler had the same one, I think, a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3478.02)|
| 0:58:02| So instead of what we've done, we did the workaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3482.02)|
| 0:58:05| to where we as a commissioner can request to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3485.02)|
| 0:58:11| But if we follow the rules, if they don't have it within five days, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3491.02)|
| 0:58:17| it has to be in writing within five days, that Wednesday before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3497.02)|
| 0:58:20| We could also suspend the rules at any point and then do whatever we wanted anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3500.02)|
| 0:58:26| I think the general sentiment of this body has been we are hesitant to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3506.02)|
| 0:58:34| into a point in which they cannot use their land for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3514.02)|
| 0:58:38| because of some scheduling or parliamentary issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3518.02)|
| 0:58:42| We're really hesitant to just jack people when they're not close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3522.02)|
| 0:58:49| But this was the stopgap to the last thing, so is there a proposed stopgap for the next thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3529.02)|
| 0:58:54| Or is it just a matter of enforcing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3534.02)|
| 0:58:57| All of our rules, there's probably 20 rules the last time we really did a deep dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3537.02)|
| 0:59:01| that we don't enforce on a daily basis, like how many minutes you get to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3541.02)|
| 0:59:05| and how many times you get to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3545.02)|
| 0:59:07| There's all kinds of little things that are the gray area of how strict we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3547.02)|
| 0:59:12| So I guess if there's specific language to debate, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3552.02)|
| 0:59:19| But I don't know how somebody wouldn't just do another workaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3559.02)|
| 0:59:25| This is what I'd ask Mr. Fraser to do, to watch and take notes of anything that's coming up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3565.02)|
| 0:59:33| And if we see that it can become an issue, I think we need to bring it back in the future sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3573.02)|
| 0:59:40| I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3580.02)|
| 0:59:41| I understand exactly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3581.02)|
| 0:59:44| Some things need to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3584.02)|
| 0:59:48| All right, any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3588.02)|
| 0:59:51| Quickly, any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3591.02)|
| 0:59:53| I'll jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3593.02)|
| 0:59:56| Robert's Rules of Order, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3596.02)|
| 1:00:02| I don't want to make anybody mad, but we've got to follow Robert's Rules of Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3602.02)|
| 1:00:07| because we're going to have new commissioners in a year or so, a little over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3607.02)|
| 1:00:15| And we've got to follow the Robert's Rules of Order to make sure that the new ones follow Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3615.02)|
| 1:00:22| And I'll be the first one to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3622.02)|
| 1:00:25| If there's a question to ask, I'll start talking in that microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3625.02)|
| 1:00:29| I wasn't recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3629.02)|
| 1:00:31| I can't talk in that microphone until I'm recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3631.02)|
| 1:00:34| Or you have the floor to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3634.02)|
| 1:00:39| We just got to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3639.02)|
| 1:00:40| I think we need to start paying a little more attention to the Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230417-rules-committee?start=3640.02)|
