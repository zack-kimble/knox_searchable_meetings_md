| 0:00:00| 400 West Main County Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| Just a point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:07| Knox County is losing an employee, but it will be the federal government and HUD's gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7)|
| 0:00:12| Our grants program has been under great scrutiny the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| and Eric Hoagland stepped up and done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| I know personally he's turned down two job offers at BetterPay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| and when he came a few weeks ago and said HUD had offered him a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| I begged him to stay until June 19th when we finish our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| for $2 million of energy efficiency money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| But this is his last county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:36| He will be monitoring all HUD grants for every city, county in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| including the state of Tennessee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| So they've chosen a good person, and at least he's going to be in a great role for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:50| But he'll be leaving June 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| I just wanted to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| It's been one heck of a ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| I never thought, you know, when I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| Bumpy ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Well, it's, you know, it was part of the fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| But I never thought I'd really leave Knox County unless it was for a HUD job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:18| and I really never thought this day would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| So I just wanted to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| And anything I can do, and I'm just moving two blocks down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| so anything I can do to help the county, yeah, I'm sure we'll be glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Congratulations, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Eric, don't forget me when you get ready to go to Turkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| I know I still want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| I actually have more time for extracurricular activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| 803 is the resolution establishing the Knox County tax rates for the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| beginning July 1, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Yeah, I got a substitute motion, and that is to use the same tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| but we're going to keep it the way it was done in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| where we'd have $1.10 for the general fund, keep the debt service at 36 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:40| and the schools at $1.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| And in doing so, what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| instead of using the 9.2 from appropriations from the debt fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| we're going to use that comes up to about $2.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| and that would be used for transfer that debt service fund to the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| so that we keep our tax rates for those three categories the same from one year to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:17| Yeah, that's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Let me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| I haven't been through this process before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| but you're basically talking about maintaining the same tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| The bottom dollar is the same tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| It's just how you divide up the money when it comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| and I think it's more appropriate to use the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| which is an ongoing revenue source to pay for an ongoing expense, which is our debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:51| instead of using appropriating fund balance to pay for an ongoing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| Whereas if we move it over to the operations, if during the year they find savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:07| then obviously they don't have to use that appropriation from that fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| It makes it a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| And I've talked with John Troyer, and he is fine with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| I guess my question was more going forward since the appraisal process has not concluded itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| What we'll have to do is approve the rate today using the old appraisals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| and then sometime in the future, July, maybe August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| depending on once we know what that equalization rate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| then we'll have to come back and redo the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| John, did I explain that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| We're trading property tax dollars from the general fund to the debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| and the debt service fund is just going to appropriate an operating transfer back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| It all works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| It's three cents, $2.4 million, and it still balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Mr. Troyer, what would a penny equate to precisely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Our current budget was $814,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We've exceeded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| In the new year, we budgeted $824,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Twenty-four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=335)|

| 0:08:14| Mr. Chairman, what's the difference in 805 and 806?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| Why are there two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| There are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| It's just we're required by state law to do an initial resolution and then a final resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| and it's the same money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| And so it just takes two different resolutions to do a bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| And then we've made that one step further as we're proposing to do a bond anticipation note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| which is 808, but it's going to be still the same $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| The same $16 million the whole time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| The whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=526)|

| 0:11:41| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=701)|

| 0:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| I just wanted to make a comment on this since I was the sponsor of the resolution after a vote on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| is because so many of the things that occur in the Audit Committee may eventually affect what we do in the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| we wanted to have a representative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| And as you note here, it's an ex officio non-voting member, but it's someone that can come back to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| He would have access to many of the same documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| and I guess it would even mean if they went into an executive session on something that was very sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| he could eventually bring that information back to the Ethics Committee also, and that's why that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Commissioner Briggs, how do you personally feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Are you in favor of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| I think if there are ethics issues that come up in the Audit Committee that may not fall actually into some sort of legal context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| I think it's good for the committee to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| I will add I'm not sure how necessary it would be because any member of the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and I try to attend all of the Audit Committee meetings myself because I think this is a very important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| It's probably one of the most important committees after the Financial Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| and the Intergovernmental Committee we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| So any of us could attend and then report back also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| I expect because of the Open Meeting Act laws is that they would very rarely go into executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| But I guess I'd say I'm neutral on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I'm the messenger, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I'm going to be voting against this and for much of the reasons that you have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| I think that and I originally had voted in favor of it because I thought well and then I got to thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| It seems to me that we're opening up a Pandora's box here because then we can have anybody coming in and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| okay, if the Ethics Committee is going to have a non-voting ex officio member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| then we want somebody there too and we want somebody to be able to go into executive session, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| I would suggest that the audit or the Ethics Committee, and I agree with you, it's a very important committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| that they appoint someone as their liaison who goes to those meetings because if this person is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| quote, non-voting ex officio, they're going to be going anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| And so if you appoint a liaison, then that liaison is going to go and they have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I mean, it's an open meeting and they allow people to go and speak anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I just think that we're opening up a situation here where we're adding people to the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| whether they're non-voting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I mean, they are a, quote, member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I also see issues with an executive session if someone does go in and then brings this information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| I mean, that's the whole purpose of executive session is to be able to discuss things in private that maybe should be kept private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| And so I will be voting against this, not because I don't think you need the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| It's just that I think you have access to it anyway by appointing a liaison who would be the liaison from the Ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| But as far as our taking that step to put someone on the Audit Committee as a, quote, member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| whether they're voting or not, I just see that as opening up a Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And so I just wanted to, you know, express my feeling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| As a member of the Audit Committee, I know that its attendance has grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| so that we are no longer meeting in the commission conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| We're probably meeting in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Anyone that wants to attend can, and I know of no one that has been ignored whenever they wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| So I think that saying someone technically has a title about being there probably is redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| and that the Audit Committee exists and anyone that wants to attend can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| I don't see a reason behind this, so I guess I'd vote against it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Let me ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Mr. Bridge, you said you were neutral on it and just the messenger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| because I don't know where I'm at either on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| You said you were just neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| I don't want to be a person advocating for it or against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| because even in the Ethics Committee there was a variance of opinion, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| as to what the person should be doing when they went to the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| and then also if we really needed someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| So the discussion occurred and it was a split vote to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| But, you know, I think this commission, each commission member here can decide whether they think this is good or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| I will tell you that the Ethics Committee did vote in a majority, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| to recommend this to the commission that we appoint that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Okay, because I'm sort of like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I mean, I'm neutral myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| I don't know if this is an open committee and a hundred more people can come if they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| And, you know, I will say that I think having an ex-officio non-voting member is almost like liaison anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| It's just that they're, you know, they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| And I doubt some of the unusual situations would occur where he would have a different role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| than as a simpler observer, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| But I'll just end my comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| I asked the law director if would this place, although it would be a non-voting member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| would they fall underneath the Sunshine Law because they could influence how the members, the voting members, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| And it could, instead of being a liaison that could communicate with the audit committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:26| it may prevent him from being able to talk to them and convey to them one-on-one what they would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| So I'm going to, I guess, although I have a great deal of respect for Louis Cosby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| I'm going to vote against this not because of him but because I just think it's best just to leave it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| What if we made it change the wording as an ex officio to a liaison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| Would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| I mean, the ethics committee did vote for that to happen, or the audit committee won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| What if we changed the wording to liaison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I don't think that we even need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I think if the ethics committee wants to appoint a liaison to attend these meetings, they can do that without us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| I guess my problem is this commission appointing somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| I mean, if they want to have a liaison to go to those meetings and report back and participate in discussion, they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| And they don't really need us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| My problem is that this commission then opens itself up to others coming in and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| well, we want you to appoint us as a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| We want you to, you know, go into executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| I just feel like we've got a five-member committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| It's operating well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| They're now going through their charter process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| They're still kind of in their infancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| To me, this just kind of muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| But the ethics committee can do that without this body doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| You know, you're saying it doesn't make a difference because he can attend the meetings anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| And so you're saying, why put him on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| So I'm saying, why not put him on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Obviously, the ethics committee took a vote, and they voted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| It's not something that I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And I just talked to Lewis, and he says, well, I can still go to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| But the point is, is that if it doesn't make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| then why do we want to insult the ethics committee by not doing what they've asked us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| They have asked us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| And I can't see any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| You're saying you can't see any reason to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Well, the reason I can see to do it is because the ethics committee has asked us to, and I see no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| Now, if there's a problem that you have with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| other than that you're worried that somebody else might want a non-voting member, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| then I'd like to hear that, because barring hearing a problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| I'm going to go along with the ethics committee because that's what they've asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| I'm not saying I'm going to rubber stamp everything they do, but they've asked us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| It's a non-voting member, so I can't see a reason not to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| So I'm going to vote for this, and I hope that others will vote for this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| My experience on the Knox County Commission is very seldom does somebody speak for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| or against something unless they have some sort of an ulterior motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| And I know that it's rumored that Mr. Hammond is going to run for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| and I know that it's rumored that Mr. Briggs is going to run for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| and I know that it's rumored that Mr. Cosby is going to run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| And I'm just wondering whether this doesn't have a little bit more to do with 2010 mayoral campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| than it does to whether we put him on the committee like the ethics committee has asked us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:10| I'm used to being a lightning rod and having people saying things, so it doesn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| So I have no comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| You're getting what I'm used to getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Ms. Nebrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Lumpy, you didn't mention that I was going to run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| I am, too, Lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| You know, I have an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| I'm not for it either because I gave careful consideration on the audit committee and who would be on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| even picked two from the fourth district, which is rare because they were two of the best commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| For those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| For the audit committee purposes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| I was going to say speak for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Were you only talking about the fourth district commissioner and not the eighth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| I balanced that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| It took two fours to equal your eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And it's commission confirmed by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| So that's part of the reason I'm not for it, having another member that's non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I'd like to ask the law director what he thinks about this because I can see it sort of muddying up the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:36| The only issue from a legal standpoint is that under the enabling statute that allows the creation of both of these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:48| appointment of members is to be done by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| So if commission acts to appoint someone as a non-voting ex officio member, that begs the question, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1432)|
| 0:24:03| Is he an official member or is he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Is he subject to the Open Meetings Act or is he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| If he is asked by the ethics committee to attend audit committee meetings as a liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:22| then it doesn't raise those issues because he has not been officially voted on and appointed by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:31| So in one sense, if he acts as a liaison simply at the request of the ethics committee, it avoids, I think, confusing the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| Seeing no other lights on, motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Who were the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Just two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Well, you all sounded like about ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Three ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Sixteen to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Mark couldn't help but vote with Lumpy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| Just remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Glad to see he can be right every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| He's causing me to rethink it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| 806, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| That's been deferred and withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| approvement policy to clarify the use of take-home vehicles and other policies now currently in place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1565)|

| 0:26:08| 6003, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| First of all, did everyone receive from the law director the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Did you get it in e-mail form or however?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| I want to make sure everybody got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Commissioner McKenzie mentioned earlier, and I would wholeheartedly agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| that the whole notion of the take-home vehicles is something that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| We have already seen what controversy that this creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| I guess my first question for the law director is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| given what has gone on in Nashville with Representative Faulkner's measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| and having passed the House local government, it's going to be taken up by the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| passing this resolution, how does that affect anything other than general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| I guess my question is, would this policy be in effect for the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| Until there's a final action taken by the legislature, it's impossible to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:29| When we were in Nashville earlier this week, last week when we left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| there was one version of the language that was before the House committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| When we got there, the language had been modified by the counsel for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:56| It was substantially different than the way it was originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| During the meeting, it was changed back to the original language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| I haven't seen the Senate version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| I'm assuming that it's the same language that was recommended by the House committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| It's really impossible to predict what effect it's going to have on a policy like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| There was discussion by the committee chair in the House that one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| that they were considering the measure is to avoid micromanagement of county departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:47| specifically involving vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| I wish I could give you some degree of certainty, Commissioner, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Well, I guess my point is that this whole notion of take-home vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| has even reached the halls of Nashville and the committee meetings in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| So, again, this just shows the type of controversy that we're looking at with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| I would just say this, that I think it's important that we have a policy and that we have a strong policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| And I appreciate, Mr. Law Director, your taking the time to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and giving us some various options on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| There are some things that I would like to add to this, but I'm not prepared to do it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| because there are some things I want to think about, I want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| I've mentioned the whole notion of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| You're going to be getting a parking study as soon as the audit committee has gone through it and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| You're going to be getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| We've already talked about the whole notion of the car washes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| I think these are things that we can take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| But as far as this policy is concerned, I'm not ready to vote on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| And so I guess I would ask that it be deferred for 30 days so that everybody has a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| The mayor's office to look at it, the sheriff's office to look at it, anybody that wants to look at it and give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| And I don't know that they've had an opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| So that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| I want to thank Commissioner Hammond for the work that he's done on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and the other commissioners that have looked into this policy, Harmon and Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| I appreciate you wanting to take another month to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| I think it's an important issue and we need to get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| And so I have read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| I think it sounds very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| But like you say, there might be some things commissioners would like to add between now and next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| We're talking about what might be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| But as it sits right now, Mr. Law Director, the current county charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| and county commission's relationship to take home vehicles, do we have a voice in that in the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:08| I want this question to be really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Is that a simple question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| In a word, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| About the question or about the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| The answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Currently, and I'm repeating myself, but I'm more than willing to do that because this is a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:39| The fee offices or the constitutional offices already come to you, the commission, on their operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:53| The only thing that they do outside of the regular budget process is the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1913)|
| 0:32:03| Now, that's not to say that there aren't other issues or legal issues that impact the one that you're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:15| because, as the sheriff brought to your attention when this issue was before you previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:27| he has certain legal obligations and decisions that he has to make in the course of performing the law enforcement function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:40| And to the extent that policies that this body might make that impact those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:49| he has to weigh his discretionary function as sheriff and see if, in his opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:58| action that this body takes crosses that line that he believes is solely his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| There is, without question, a tension between the legislative body, this commission, and the constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:22| But it's one that I think is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| Most counties have this issue and it's almost, we talk about separation of powers sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:43| and it's like these are almost a fourth branch of government because they are elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| who are charged with certain responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| So, this commission takes its fiscal responsibilities very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| We're in tough fiscal times, so this body is looking at things very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| By the same token, these elected officials take their responsibilities very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| So, I think that tension is somewhat natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| It's never going to completely go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| So, there's the long answer to the simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| Mr. Chairman, for the information of this committee, I just got an email and two blog posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:34| that seem to confirm that the Faulkner bill died in the Senate committee and did not get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| You may have similar information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:57| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Go ahead, will you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Go ahead, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| I think that in the budget process that we just went through, I recognize the fact that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| between the school board and county commission, there's a maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| And we can't cut their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I don't know really what all we can do, but they ask and we have to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| And I think that's the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| It's not just between, for example, the sheriff and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| I believe what we're speaking to here is the ability to say how many four-wheel vehicles we have on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| and how much it costs us to maintain those versus is that a part of a person's pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:52| and should we pay them that additional money and not have an even larger expense as it relates to a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2152)|
| 0:36:02| I believe that's what we're trying to balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I don't look at us trying to take away anyone's power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| I believe that what I'm looking at is the conversation that I get at the health club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| asking me why it is people get a take-home vehicle whenever when they were on a job somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| they didn't have a take-home vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| The question is not about a power issue between commission and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| The question is a dollar issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| People are asking where do their dollars get best spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| I understand and I didn't mean to single the sheriff out in this equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| but the earlier question related to the Faulkner bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| and I was trying to respond to your question in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| I would say that I don't, when I talked about tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| I don't view it simply as a question of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| and is someone trying to take power away from someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I think it's, to a large degree, philosophy, management philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Who's going to be responsible for running a department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| This body has fiscal responsibility and wants to have oversight in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:32| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Of course, the car issue is an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| It's one that we all hear about from our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| For me, I'm not so much concerned with taking vehicles away or retaining vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| I feel like it's our responsibility as we have three branches of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| legislative, executive, and judicial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and our role as the legislative branch is to set policy for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| If we set good policy, then the departments can sort it out themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| how they need to enact that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| I would like to see us come up with a really good, reasonable, thoughtful policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| on our vehicle fleet for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| and then the departments can sort out for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| how it will be applied to their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I feel like that's what we're called upon to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| I don't know about this fourth branch of government that kind of troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| I think that there needs to be oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| and I would like to know where these fee offices or constitutional offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| where do they fit in the tree of local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| I think we have these three branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Who provides oversight is the answer that there is no oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and that they oversee themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| I think we've all seen what problems can arise from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| not from these particular office holders, but in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| I think these are very important questions that we need to consider going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| but I would like to see a very reasonable, thoughtful vehicle policy be enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:37| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| He calls for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| I'll echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Since Mr. Hammond, you know, being on the committee has said they need more time for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| can I make a motion that we defer it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| The motion is already to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I'll call for the question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| Well, I don't see any more lights, so the motion on the floor is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Noss County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| including steps to be taken to reduce vehicle costs and to improve vehicle efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2426)|

| 0:40:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Let me just say that first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| this is about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| It's not about power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| It's not about relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| It's not about who's with whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| It's about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I want to commend Commissioner Hammond and the law director for pulling together the city of Knoxville policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| and some policies from elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I would also recommend you check out the blog post where I've pulled together some additional ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| and put up a rather lengthy blog post about 10 days ago with some good information from what some other communities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| I think that will guide him in designing a good future policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| This policy should not be viewed in conflict with that but as complementary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| This policy says looking where we are, not looking forward to a good policy, but looking where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| can we make a cut that makes sense and suggests how to do it, gives a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| also empowers the purchasing director to make some scale backs and options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I think it's a reasonable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| It's less than 10% of the take-home vehicles we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Well, depending on how you count the patrol cars and some other stuff, it's about 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| It's a very reasonable thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| It doesn't affect patrol cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| It's just a matter of take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I hope we can do this thing, not name-calling, not who's with whom, not about power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| not about relationships, just about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I want to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days so that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| when we come back with Commissioner Hammond's resolution and see if we can't not necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| I agree with you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| I don't know that they're in conflict, but I don't know exactly what's going to come back next month either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| and I don't want necessarily my hands tied next month because of what I did this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| This is about people who are currently assigned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| And so, therefore, it really wouldn't affect a future policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| I don't see the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Perhaps you can tell me where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Well, I mean, if we're going to say we have a policy here that you're allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| or this is what allows you to have a vehicle on one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| and you've come over and said to reduce it so much on the other, not that I'm opposed to that by any means, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| I just think it's best to try to come in and have one policy at one time as we move forward, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:33| And I think there might be some things that we can incorporate from yours into his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| and I'd like to be able to have that dialogue all at one time instead of trying to go from what we did this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| and now we're going to try to come back next month and do maybe something sort of different as we go into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| I don't know that we're going to be able to reduce any vehicles between now and then like you're hoping to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| and I'd like for us to reduce vehicles as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| So I just don't see that by waiting one more month so that we have one comprehensive policy that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:09| I think that's the best way to go is just to have one comprehensive policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and try to figure it all out next month and let's not postpone it anymore after next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| I guess I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| We have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| I'd just like to say that these officers, the sheriff and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| they're all elected just like we are and they're responsible for their budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| Now, are we saying that they don't know how to run their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| and don't know who needs to drive home cars or they're wasting money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Is that what we're really saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Are we trying to micromanage the county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| I'm going to vote against this because I feel like their department has to be run by their own selves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| and they have the ability to set their pace of how many cars they want to drive home or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| but I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| As stated before, this is not directed at take-home cars of just the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| This is talking about the entire Knox County fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| and I believe that I'll support a 30-day deferral until we have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| Is that your like, Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Yeah, I would support a 30-day deferral, but I would like to ask because there are amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| and I would hope the amendments, the amended version of this would be put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| because that's not what we're seeing on our screen, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| This one's very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So before the next commission meeting, I sure would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:49| Yeah, we amended these the same way in both committees, and for some reason an older version appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Only part of an older version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Yeah, part of an older version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| So I don't know why that error took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| I did put the current wording on our form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Yeah, I'm supporting the deferral for today, but I think we are getting into dangerous territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| as we try to micromanage other departments of independently elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| There was a time when the Knox County Commission attempted to micromanage the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| what school we were going to build next, what principle we were going to have at certain schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Essentially, the Knox County Commission stuck its nose into the school system's business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| to the point to where there was a very lengthy and very expensive lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| and Knox County Commission lost that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| That's why anything that has to do with the school board is on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| and while occasionally someone will pull something off of that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| we risk being pulled back into court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| if we don't approve everything that the school board puts on their consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Now, I know Mr. Faulkner's motion died today for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| I think it had more to do with how they did it than to what they were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| I think the folks in Nashville see very clearly that the Knox County Commission is about to overstep its authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| Now, while limiting vehicles may be a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| saving money for the taxpayers may be a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| micromanaging other departments that were elected by the people is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| And I see Mr. Spangler down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I'm wondering if he has something he would like to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Chief? Mr. Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| I saw you approaching the podium earlier, and I was just wondering if you had anything you'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Are we on the motion to defer or on the broader question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Then why are we addressing the merits of the proposal rather than the merits of deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Do you have a question about deferment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| I just saw Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I did, but I'll hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| I had some other thoughts that I wanted to talk about something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| but we'll do that later when it comes about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| I agree that we probably need to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I think we have some elected officials here that are capable of managing their departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| On the other hand, we do have a policy, vehicle policy, that we're fixing to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| This has some policy statements in this resolution itself that could very well be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| I'm going to kind of defer with Commissioner Lutho in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| I think we need to defer it, bring it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| I'm not wanting to get into the business of micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| I believe I think here the Sheriff's Department and or general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| I think that Sheriff Jones is quite capable of managing his own department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| I think we should deal with his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| If we think we need to save some money in a budget, then we need to talk about saving some money in a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| Just get down and say what kind of guns they carry and what kind of uniforms they wear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| because I can save money on a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| It's getting a little too much for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| So, anyway, I'm going to vote that we defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Mr. Chairman, we would like to be involved in the meetings, if you don't mind, with the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I'm sorry, but I think maybe you're taking a little bit of license, taking that too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| I don't think anybody's mentioning badges or uniforms or guns or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| If this passes, I'm bringing a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Greg, you're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I would like to make the point, Lumpy, that the Sheriff's Department isn't run by an elected board like the school system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| And what I'm talking about is not micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| It's setting good policy for the county, good, reasonable, thoughtful policy for the county, not micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:24| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I'd like to comment back, since I was directly addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| The statement was that I didn't want to micromanage a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and we're not talking about the policy that Mr. Hammond presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| I am all for the 30-day dealing with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| This resolution has policy issues in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| I said I think it needs to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| This resolution is getting down to the level of micromanaging departments with the number of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| and telling that department what it needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| You know what I think would be a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| If we could get-oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| I'm going to suggest that maybe the Vehicle Committee should meet between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| and next month's meeting and try to combine these two into one coherent policy that does what we need it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3068)|
| 0:51:18| I can make that part of my substitute motion that we ask that the Vehicle Committee bring back a recommendation for one policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:30| And have it come from the Vehicle Committee instead of from individual commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| I can make that part of my substitute if the second will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| All I'm asking is that you all get back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| What I'm not okay with is, you know, the Vehicle Committee was started as an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| We were not started as a committee to create policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| We were started as a committee to create guidelines, advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| And so I've always felt like that the Vehicle Committee needs to meet to discuss these things like a think tank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| but anything that's brought to commission needs to be brought by individual commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, if the committee doesn't vote to bring something forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| but it would allow commissioners who are within that committee to discuss in an open meeting how to combine their individual policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:30| I think it might also take some of the personalities out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| So does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| Second agrees to meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I agree to the meeting, but I don't agree that we'll come up with a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| So the second does agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| That's my question, I guess, to Mr. Hammond or to any other member of the committee, the Vehicle Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| And I'd like to remind the commission that Knox County Commission has been struggling with vehicles for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| At least in 1999, there were some efforts to form policy, and those were rebuffed by many members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:20| So this is a very old issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| It's not one that I can see being solved in any 30 days, and certainly it needs to thoroughly be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| I hate to use the term task force, but it probably workshops or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:39| but it probably, in my mind, would need that kind of detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| and we can't just take something that is to be adopted from the city or from some other document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| And I appreciate all the people that have worked on the committee, Dr. Harmon and his work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| and all of you all have done an exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| And we all are aware of the need for this now, so we need to do a good job with it, as several have mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| But I'm for the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3254)|

| 0:56:50| Always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| I'm glad to see you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I'm glad to see you're doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| Last month, Mr. Salter told you that Mr. Rockett had testified many times under trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| that John Evans had never done any original reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| I went back to look for Mr. Rockett's depositions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| and I found out Mr. Rockett didn't even testify at the trial for motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| So that could not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Now, he did testify on depositions for a couple hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| but he never even mentioned the original reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| The subject never came up with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| so that first statement he told you about what Mr. Rockett supposedly said was completely untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| So I decided to go back and see what the depositions said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| because the stories changed on these reports many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I decided to see what the depositions said about these original reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| when the first story was given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| and I'm reading to you from Tom Salter's deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| According to his deposition, the original reports, it indicates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| were done under an improper format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| and he had to go back and redo them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| This is Dean Farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| You stated at one point gathering some of the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| because you had to go back and redo a number of old reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| Answer. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Question. All but 2006, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Answer. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| He admitted he went back and redid the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Now, those reports that he told you last month were never done and don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| Larry Vangilder quoted one of them word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| See, what he doesn't realize is portions of these reports still do exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| and John Evans certified under penalty of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| that the pathogen reduction requirements had not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| All these tests that never failed that didn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| we have them, and they failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| We have documents where they were not supposed to sell by with solids prior to 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| because of failing reports that never existed and weren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| The great and illustrious Larry Vangilder wrote a story about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:14| and he happens to be the reporter that never talked to Tom about this, supposedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| about the reports that were never done and the failed tests that never happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| and detailed all these failed tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| and quoted one of these reports that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| I wanted to give Tom an opportunity to come to this microphone last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| and tell you they didn't exist before I dropped the nickel on this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| They exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| I'm not going to comment on where they're at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| and what portions still exist and what portions do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| but a portion of these reports definitely do exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| They were definitely done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| and Tom Salter admitted under oath that he went back and redone them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| Now, the more interesting part is when we asked him under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| if he looked at the EPA-required quarterly tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| before he made new certifications certifying that they passed everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| I've got his deposition right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| Basically, he said, I didn't look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| We asked him, did you review the quarterly test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| I'll get my word search right in here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Did you review the quarterly test required by the EPA to sign these certifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| I had this out here a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| Anyway, he was asked, did you look at the required quarterly test required by the EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| to sign these certifications, and he said, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| So, basically, what we got here is Mr. Salter admitted he went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| and redone John Evans' reports, and when he'd done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| he'd done so without even looking at the EPA quarterly test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| to see if they passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| And when you go back and look at the test, they didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| So, anyway, the documents exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I would like to get a copy of all of them in their entire form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| because I need those to collect the million dollars you all can possibly receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| It's a little hard to collect the money when you all don't want to produce the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| but they obviously exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| And John Evans wrote, I certify under penalty law that the pathogen reduction requirements in 503.32.A.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| and the vector attraction reduction requirements in 503.33.B.5 have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| I am aware there are significant penalties for false certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| including the possibility of fine and imprisonment, and he signed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| Where's the rest of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| He admitted he'd done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| He admitted he'd redone them because the first were improperly formatted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| There is two ways to format these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Either format that you met your requirements and you sold it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| or you format you didn't meet your requirements and what you did with it if you kept it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| or kept it on site for long-term composting in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| So if he's admitted he had to go back and redo them because they were improperly formatted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| the only other way you could have formatted them was failing ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| and there happens to be a few of those floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| I need these documents, and I would appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I've had a year and a half trying to recover documents to recover your money for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| At my expense, I'm paying the nickel on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| I'm going to collect your money for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| We're going back to 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| 102, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| 102 and 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Mr. Chairman, 102 and 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Yeah, 102 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| honoring Russell Monat for earning the rank of Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And Resolution 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| You want to do them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Yeah, do them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Consider for resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| honoring Chris Lansman for earning the rank of Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| I'm going to get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| You have something, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Second, third, and fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| This past Friday night Commissioner Pinkston and myself were able to go to these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| what did you call that now, the ceremony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| They were made Eagle Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| I wasn't a scout, as you could tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| But, anyway, they were recognized there within their own troop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| and we thought it would be great if we could recognize them from the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| and from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Commissioner Pinkston had both of them a proclamation on Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| and we now have each one of them a proclamation or resolution from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| signed, sealed, and delivered for each one of the boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| This is Russell Monette and Chris Fensler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Let's give them a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:47| As all of the commissioners know, this is a great honor to become an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| You have them in your area, too, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| But, you know, only one, we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| only one out of every 200 scouts ever made the Eagles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:11| Get the picture made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:24| Mr. Chairman, they're going to be working down Camp Buck Tom this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| so they're going to stay busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Gentlemen, before you all leave, two guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| we are going to do a banquet next year for everybody that has ever received the Eagle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| and we're looking for the oldest all the way down to the youngest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| So we're going to do that next year, the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| and we'd certainly like for you two gentlemen to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| I guess, Larry, you're an Eagle, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| He's got like a buzzard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| Back to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Do we have anyone else for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| If not, we can break for about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| I want to break and then go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| We'll break and we'll start zoning at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=3973)|

| 1:12:12| Thanks, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I just wanted just a general 20-second definition of technology overlay, that term, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| The zoning ordinance, in addition to having several what we call base zones, R.A., P.R., P.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:31| the zoning ordinance also has a handful of overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| So in situations where you do have an area that was identified and has been established as an overlay area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| the overlay district goes on top of the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| What the overlay zone does, it provides an additional layer of design review of how the project is actually going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4367)|
| 1:13:00| So it doesn't affect the use of the property, but it affects how the property will look, how the property will be developed on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:09| those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| So is it aesthetics or is it utilities, power, water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| It's more design, aesthetics, design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We do look at how the property is laid out in terms of circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| There's a site plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| It has to do with signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| So it is a design overlay is the best way to try to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4415)|

| 1:17:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| This request was initiated by the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals in September of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| when they considered an appeal of an administrative decision denying the right of a landscape contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| to operate a business within the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| At that time, the BZA deferred its decision and requested that MPC study the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| and provide clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Amongst those things that were discussed at that meeting was the need for definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and the possibility for selecting appropriate zone districts for contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| and contractor storage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| And, in addition, the use-on-review process was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| For the MPC's January meeting, staff originally prepared an amendment that was modeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| after the existing use-on-review process for mulching operations in the agricultural zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| And after discussion, the Planning Commission postponed its decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| and asked staff to assemble a working group to look into further refinement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| of the proposed definitions and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| This working group included three planning commissioners, two Knox County staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| two MPC staff members, and a representative of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| The working group convened and agreed upon proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| A public meeting was held Tuesday, March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| And the proposed amendments were considered by the MPC at its April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| The strategy that was put forward is threefold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| One, to create appropriate new definitions for contractors and contractor storage yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| and specifically landscape contractors, to assign these uses to appropriate zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:36| and then to develop regulations for contractor storage yards to be considered as a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| Three new definitions are proposed, one for contractor, one for contractor storage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| and an additional definition for landscape contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| Each newly defined use will be applied according to the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| In some districts, they're proposed as permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| In others, as uses-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| The proposed standards for use-on-review include three sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| a section describing the minimum required information on a site plan and application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| a section with minimum development requirements that will be required by all approved uses-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| and then a section for other review criteria that's a little more flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| and allows the planning commission to make approvals with the flexibility to adjust for the size of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:40| as it relates to the size of the tracks and the adjoining neighboring uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| Staff prepared three options for the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| They're in your packet as options A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Option A was to provide a definition for contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| and the addition of contractor to the list of occupations permitted as home occupations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| in Section 4.90.02 of the Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Upon study, we found that self-employed contractors who operate on their own, out of their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| are currently doing so illegally, and we wanted to create an avenue for their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| Option B provides a definition for contractor storage yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| and lists contractor storage yard as a permitted use in the industrial, light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| and business and manufacturing zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| and as a use-on-review in the general business, neighborhood commercial, and rural commercial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| And then Option 3 provides a definition for landscape contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| and lists landscape contractor storage yard as a use-on-review in Section 5.22.03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| and adds Section 4.102 standards for the use-on-review approval of contractor storage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4917)|
| 1:22:09| Ultimately, the Planning Commission recommended a blend of options A, B, and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| and in doing so, they made one amendment to the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:26| setting a minimum 100-foot setback for all contractor storage yards from adjacent residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:34| And then I would add in Paragraph C of Section 4.102.02, if you decide to adopt these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:45| that's a section that requires a residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| and we should add a clause saying that in the agricultural zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| an occupied resident must be maintained on the same lot as the proposed contractor storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4975)|
| 1:23:05| That would eliminate the need for a residence to be required in the commercial zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| if you should decide to adopt what was essentially Option B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| With that, I will rest and take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| We have someone else, Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| Mr. Chairman, Commission, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Bob Wolfenbarger, 3200 Lake Sand Lane, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| I'm here on behalf of the neighbors that I usually speak for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| which is the 8th District Preservation Association and Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| but there's others here, if I may note that, that might want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| And if you'll abide with me and let me read, I'll do better and we'll move faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| On behalf of the friends and neighbors with whom I speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| we respectfully request, Commission, to deny this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| and further we request that you treat all contracting businesses equally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| and require that they operate in a commercial or industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| The issue before you is a health, a safety, and a regulatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| as well as a quality of life issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| In addition to the negative impact of these and other business activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| on specifically affected neighborhoods in which they might locate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| we would ask, Commission, to consider the many and varied economic, environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and potential health costs associated with increasing the number of potentially unsupervised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| unregulated businesses spread throughout our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| These businesses, their associated activities and noise do compromise the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| for the next-door neighbors in their affected neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| But additionally, they potentially proliferate risky chemicals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| and other contaminants throughout our residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| with their associated storage of fuels, lubricants, herbicides, pesticides, and mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| Also, by allowing contractors to operate in the manner proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| Knox County would be further encouraging illegal and unregulated business activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| without an established plan, the manpower, or the designated financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| necessary for appropriate oversight and regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| Not to discuss the precedent this amendment sets for the next business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| that might find itself on the wrong side of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Further, when contracting businesses are located within the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| commercial and industrial zone, by their location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| they are more likely to be scrutinized by the appropriate authorities and inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| license and codes inspectors, the fire marshal, INS, OSHA, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| Conversely, when businesses are allowed to indiscriminately proliferate throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| they become unmanageable and thereby unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| We cannot regulate what we cannot find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| And many of these small businesses, quote, small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| currently do not buy and will not renew licenses, be listed in the phone book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| and when appropriate, locate to a business appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| How are the authorities to know who is legal and who is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| We were told at the only public meeting in this matter that it was up to the neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| to report the illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| Legitimate businesses, which locate in the appropriately zoned locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| are much more likely to pay the necessary and mandated actual costs associated with doing their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| within the established guidelines and rules set forth by the city, the county, the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Additionally, these compliant and legitimate businesses are placed in a competitive disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| against those businesses that do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| and will not be required to pay the necessary and actual costs to meet the same standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| Many of these unregulated businesses will not pay the licenses, the taxes, the insurance, and the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| nor will they comply with the appropriate and required regulations for safety equipment and training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| the chemical equipment and training and certifications, the OSHA training and certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| NIS training and certifications, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| These expenses that the competing legitimate and responsible businesses do pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| not to mention workers' compensation, unemployment taxes, and income tax and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| One important and obvious issue comes to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| Rhetorically speaking, how frequently do we see lawn trailers with commercial mowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| and related equipment being pulled by a privately licensed vehicle with or without commercial signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| The state requires all vehicles used commercially to be licensed commercially, including the trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| Further, as you know, automobiles and homeowners insurance excludes commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:11| So if we were to allow, excuse me, so we were wondering how many landscape contractors are insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:23| and would be insured in the event of an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Hypothetically speaking, a lawn trailer breaks free on a crowded interstate in front of a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| Or less horribly, whose bond or insurance pays for the termite infestation from the contaminated mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| improperly placed around someone's home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| And the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| Once again, your friends and your neighbors of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and the Eighth District Preservation Association ask that the commissioners side with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| and that you deny this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| We need to get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I'm going to go ahead and make the motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I'm sure that there will be some amendments to this, and I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| Here's the reason why I believe that we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| There needs to be some middle ground between full-blown commercial and something that's not business at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:31| There needs to be some middle ground that is respected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| and I think that use on review is a good process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| Here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| If you have a person who has a very small business, you know, a landscaping business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| and all their neighbors like them, and they decide they're going to get their property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:57| so that they can locate their small landscaping business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| if they get that property rezoned, then that property for the future is zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| and they can do anything they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| They can grow to any level they want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| If you have a use on review process, then that business is allowed with certain constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:24| and when that business grows beyond those constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| then it's time for that business to find a commercial location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Or if that person sells their property and they move, if it's a use on review granted to a specific business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:42| then that use on review is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| If that person gets their property rezoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| then something that's invasive that the neighborhood might disapprove of can be moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| and they won't have much say-so in it if it's already been zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| Use on review is some gray area, and I see I've got some of my constituents here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| and I'm not sure whether the business located next to them should be there, whether it shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| It's kind of in the gray area as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| If we made a ruling that maybe it shouldn't, that it's grown too big, that would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| Or if we made the ruling that nothing any larger than this can be located close to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:29| that would be fine for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| What I'm thinking about is not this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I'm thinking about the entire county, and I think we need some middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| We need some middle ground so that a person is not forced to rezone their property commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| any time there's any commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Because I'm telling you, my family, our neighbors love us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| If I had a landscaping business, I could go to any of our residential parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| and I could get the neighbors to go along with zoning it commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| But then if I sell that property, it's still commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| and somebody could open up a Weigel's in the middle of one of these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| That's why, and nothing against Weigel's, good constituents of the sixth district, and fine farm stores they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| But the point is we've got to have some middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| We've got to have some middle ground, and I believe that middle ground is use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| And so that's why I'm supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| And, again, I'm sure that it will be amended, but I think we need some very clear set guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| so that people know how big can I get before I've got to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| Yeah, I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| When it dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| We can't discuss it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Does anyone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| I'd like to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Well, wait a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| He's already called for a second, and if he's declared that it dies for a lack of a second, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| It's over, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Good enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| Could I speak on behalf of the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| The motion has died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| No speaking of it whatsoever now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Well, it's been turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| It's been turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| I'd like to hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| He'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Let's hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Robert Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| You might change your mind and we'll go back for the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| Robert Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| My address is 5312 West Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| I do own a landscaping company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| I got something short and brief I wanted to say to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| If this comes back to you all, something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| I think I gave each and every one of you all a packet that talked about landscaping and horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| Horticulture is allowed a permitted use in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| You do not have to go under use under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| If you look and study the package that I gave to each and every one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| you will understand what I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| In the beginning, in April 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| codes enforcement and the law director gave an interpretation of ag zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| as to the language being used that landscaping was not listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| therefore not allowed in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| When this was brought out in the open, horticulture was brought to their attention as a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| and it was their interpretation that landscaping was not horticulture, that horticulture is only farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| We followed advisement from codes enforcement that since the word landscaping was not specifically mentioned in the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| along with horticulture and farming to take steps to get the word landscaping added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| All the steps taken find us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| However, if any of us had done our research, we would have found that landscaping and horticulture go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:15| You can be a horticulturalist but not a landscaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| but you cannot be a landscaper without being a horticulturalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Within a few hours of research on the Internet through university websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| we have found overwhelming evidence to contradict their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| According to Bob Auger, professor and head of the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| the definition of horticulture is the science and art of cultivating fruits, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:49| According to Webster's New World Dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| cultivating means to prepare and use soil, land, et cetera, for growing crops, to till, to break up the surface soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5751)|
| 1:36:00| around plants in order to destroy weeds, prevent crusting, and preserve moisture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| to grow plants or crops from seeds, bulbs, shoots, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| to improve or develop plants by various horticulture techniques,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| which as a landscaper and horticulturalist I do when installing and maintaining landscapes and lawns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:25| And when my wife asked Mr. Auger what are some of the job opportunities one can expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| with a horticulture or plant science degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| he forwarded her to the university's plant science department website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| Under examples of career choices of some of our graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| the first is landscape design and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| The second is turf grass management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| Furthermore, Judge Stansberry stated in court on May 5th that, I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| horticulture and landscaping are so intrinsically intertwined that their differences cannot be distinguished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:07| As you will have no doubt reviewed the packets of information we've provided to each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| the argument that horticulture and landscaping are synonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| This information should answer most questions and prove this to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| This information does not just come from the University of Tennessee, and previously quoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| but from Clemson University, Virginia Tech, Iowa State University, Mississippi State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| Southwest Tennessee Community College, and Nashville State Community College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| whose horticulture programs prepare students for careers as landscape designers, landscape installers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| irrigation technicians, landscape management, and lawn care professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| And these are only the universities and colleges that we researched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| and I am positive that I can find countless others around the world providing this same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| I think adding landscaping as an amendment under use on review in the Ag Zone would be redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:09| Redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| Since horticulture is already listed as a permitted use in the Ag Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| We're going back to page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| Discussion regarding the May 5, 2009 Audit Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| No action taken in a governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| No action taken, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| I can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| No action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| The discussion, I asked to have that placed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| In a nutshell, our chairman, Dr. Carsello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| and after discussion with the Audit Committee members was requested that when the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:06| Mr. Walls, is instructed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| when there are projects that commissioners want him to look into, be it golf course or parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:18| or somebody embezzling money at Little Springs School over the coupon books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| that that be funneled through the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| or at least that they come to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:16| Not to discount any of the requests of members of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6016)|
| 1:40:23| Obviously, there are five members on the Audit Committee, three of us commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| We derive our power and authority from the full commission as we derive ours from the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| That's the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| It's a more efficient way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| That's the way it's done in other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| That's the way corporate America does the Audit Committees for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| Any board member calling the internal auditor, they refer questions through the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| So that's basically the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| That's just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| Do you need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| It's just a discussion and request of courtesy somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| Discussion regarding the process for payment of discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| I've been working with John Troyer as far as trying to get this process sped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| Obviously, sometimes we get requests for funds, and they are time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| And right now, we're only, since we have to publish the list of everything that we're going to disperse funds to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6108)|
| 1:42:00| we're only doing that one time a month, and that deadline is the same as the agenda deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:08| so that we save in costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Because if we do it as a separate item every time, it's going to run up the cost per check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| So the other thing to keep mindful of is that every time you put in a request, and if you're taking your funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:27| and obviously every commissioner has a right to divide those up however they wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| but if you do it in very small amounts, just remember every time you do it, it's costing us $40, $50 for each request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:43| So if you do a $250 request, you've spent $40 or $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| You do a $1,000 request, you've still only spent $40 or $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| So just keep that in mind when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| But I did talk with John Troyer to make sure his office is not what's holding up getting these checks out to those that are seeking funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:07| And he now has a process to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Commissioner Lutho, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| That's not $40 or $50, or is it $40 or $50 per request or every time we publish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| I believe it's $40 or $50 for every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Because if there are several requests, that publication, from what I understand, I'm getting my information from Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:38| Jolie, could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Because I believe that when we request several checks, it's costing more than just $40 or $50 for that one ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| It may be a couple hundred dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| The only legal notices that I have done has been for special call meetings, and those end up costing right around a couple hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6230)|
| 1:44:01| So you look at our agendas and how many lines that would be in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:09| How much information are we required to put in for each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Like if we're giving money to an organization X, how much information are we required to put in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| Maybe the law director may have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| The state statute requires that the organization be named, the amount, and the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:34| And I believe there's one other piece of required information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:42| She said that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| So that's still going to take up several lines in the newspaper, and that's how they charge is how many lines you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:56| But obviously there's probably a disclaimer at the beginning of each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Jolie, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| Again, the only legal notices that I've done have been for our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| and that's all I have to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Our agendas for our meetings are normally pretty short, and they end up costing us a couple hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:21| Yeah, they charge by the square column inch is what they charge by, and it's very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| I still don't understand why we can't do like city council, just bring it before this commission and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:33| Nothing would be more public than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| It does not make sense to me to have to run it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| When we put it on the agenda, the agenda items, like Jolie said, are put in the paper, so they know it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| and then we vote on it, and I see no reason why that we should have to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:55| Mr. Law Director, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| The reason that it has to be published is because that state statute tells us we have to publish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:07| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| Does it tell you where we have to publish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| In a newspaper, general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Well, for estates, they're published in a weekly here that's very cheap to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:24| Now, we don't have to do it in a Sentinel, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| I guess any publication that meets the criteria that the state sets forth we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| I mean, obviously we can shop around and see who gives us the best deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| I believe that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Other legal notices that we publish meet the definition of newspaper general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| As long as it has general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| We've got a few shopper papers that would like to have the inches, and they'd probably put them in free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:03| Bid it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Tony was having an ink pen emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| and I missed what the law director said about why we can't just do it in a meeting, and why would that not suffice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:17| There's a state statute that requires us to publish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| It's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| It's published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Is the county held to a different standard than cities, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Are counties held to a different standard than cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Or else we could do what Mr. Pinkston said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| I don't know what the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| It's voted up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| So you might have to wait a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| If a request came in tomorrow, you'd have to wait a month before it got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| I don't know what the city does, what their mechanism is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| This is a requirement, though, that affects county governments across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| And in developing the policy that we did, we checked with different county governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6475)|
| 1:48:03| and they were all surprised to learn that this statute even existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| I sure wish we could just have it on the agenda and vote it up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| so it's unlikely they'd complain or speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| I think we ought to put it on the agenda, vote it up or down, and let the state get on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| We're doing it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| I also make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| They're out of adjournment dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| We send them a letter and tell them they need to change that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| But I'm for voting to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| They don't want us telling them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Why should they be telling us what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| They won't take all your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Continuing on this question about these grants or these things that we're asking for funding from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:55| Mr. Law Director, can I talk to my fellow seatmate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6535)|
| 1:49:04| Public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| You have to publish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| Do it on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| Lean into the mic and talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| It's not something we're going to vote on, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Well, it might affect your future deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| It might affect my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| As long as they keep notes, he's clear, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| They've got notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Now, just to be clear, what I just heard, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| what I heard was what these organizations need to provide us with is the name of the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| the amount requested, and the purpose for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| That's what gets published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| That's what gets published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| It's a sheet of eight different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| The thing I'm struggling with, and I've probably been driving Jolie and Drusilla crazy over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| is there's a lot of things that these loosely organized teams and organizations just don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6607)|
| 1:50:21| If this is basically all they have, they haven't developed a mission statement and all this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| The form that we drafted that was an exhibit to the policy that was approved has asterisks by certain of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:42| information fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| And as I recall, the ones that have asterisks is the required information that has to go in the publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:53| The others are not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| I think the Board of Directors, is that asterisk on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| So something like that, if they don't, it's a requirement, but if they don't have it, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I mean, obviously, if they don't have it, like you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| They've got work to do this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| So all these things need to be in by Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Mr. Law Director, maybe, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| I never understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Sometimes our charter trumps everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Other times it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| There's nothing that seems to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| It just depends on, apparently, who's presenting it before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| whether the charter overrules the Constitution or state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| If you went to Nashville and just argued that we were a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| that we had the right to oversee these fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| why do we not have the right to say that we're going to bring these discretionary funds before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| and everybody here vote on whether or not we give the money away or not to the people that want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| Can that not be a public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Now, we're a charter form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Why can't we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| There's nothing in the charter that remotely addresses this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:20| There's a very specific state statute that addresses this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| So this isn't a matter of our charter being in conflict with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| It's just that all we have is the state statute that tells, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| what local governments are supposed to do under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:47| So that means if we have a resolution telling us what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| if we had an addendum saying that we shall publish the fact that we're going to talk about discretionary funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| at the end of every meeting and we'll detail those and we add that to our record of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| then we can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| I was simply answering that direct question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I think you may have inferred something that I didn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:23| It's what we want to hear, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| Again, we'll do as homework as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| I don't know how this affects the rest of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| but I've been informed that the TV is frozen and there's no sound for the community TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:43| I have some announcements that I need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| Well, we're not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| Do you have something else on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| Not on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Jolie, we all get $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| I've got $60 left in my account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| If I give that to whoever, does that come out of what I have or is that, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| if I put in 10 requests all year or 15 requests for $100 here and $50 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| is Knox County paying that or does that come off my $6,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| To pay for the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| To pay for the ad, yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| I don't think it's been determined who's going to pay the cost of the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| But an ad in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| I don't think it's been determined who's going to pay that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| Hurry up and get rid of your $60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| Any more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| For the fifth time I'm going to say it's a silly bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| Borderline stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Discussion regarding House Bill 714 and Senate Bill 679.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Approve a motion to send a letter, but that's null and void now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| and it didn't make it out of the Senate down there, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Same thing, 7-1 approved, send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| I was just going to give a little bit of an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| and a little bit more information and details that Commissioner Harmon mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| is that this thing did come before the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| They call it the State and Local Government Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| The motion was made by Bill Keatron from Murfreesboro to pass the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| It failed for lack of a second, so it died there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| There was no discussion because the motion was never put forward, so it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Discussion to request Knox County fee offices to provide information regarding positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| and policies on overtime, salary enhancements, and bonuses intended for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| You got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| That's the booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| 9-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| 4-1 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| And that's the booklet you got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Page 34 through 38 are the pages that dealt with office staff salary compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:38| And it was just my intent to use this probably in the next budget cycle to open up the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:48| of how salaries are addressed in comparison with teachers primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| And what's happened historically has been that the school system tends to give broad 2% raises across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7015)|
| 1:57:04| which tends to separate central office staff from teachers in terms of their compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| And I think we need to be about closing that gap, increasing classroom teacher salaries to the extent that we're competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:22| with our neighboring counties, which we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| Are we talking about fee offices or schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| I'm talking about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| We're on fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| I thought we were talking about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I find myself in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Don't forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| I find myself in the position of needing and wanting to issue an apology to the fee offices, to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| and to our citizens for my pointed and critical and unnecessary and unfair remarks earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| Apparently, there was confusion as to when this information should be turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Some folks did not realize that during the finance I had specifically asked that it be brought in by budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7076)|
| 1:58:05| And there was confusion as to when that information should be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| So, again, my apologies to the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| I did not realize I was supposed to send a letter specifically asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| And so, again, my apologies for making it appear as though they were not willing to conform to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| Apparently, there was confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| I take full responsibility for that confusion and will issue the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| And I'm sure that the information will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| One more word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| Commissioner Norman, did you add another discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I did add a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| It had to do with moratorium on billboards and electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| And I suppose that what some people have contacted me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| that they're seeing electronic message centers that are going up within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| And this is a permitted on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| It is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| And it was my understanding that the moratorium dealt with all billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| and message centers and electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| And so I suppose I'd like to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| or the possibility of including electronic message centers on premise message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| within the moratorium as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| So I'd open it up for comments from anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| I'd like to make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| I thought about that after we did the EMCs and the moratorium last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| And really you're talking about a large group of, I mean, you're talking about bank bill signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| You're talking about gas station signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| You're talking numerous things that we could, you know, stop a business from signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:09| If you define the price of the new signs on gas stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| having electronic numbers up there instead of the old plastic numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| I think we need to be careful that we're not keeping a business from opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| if they have an electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| You know, the Arby's on Emery Road hasn't opened, but what if they're waiting on a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| and they can't put one up because we're moratoriumed a restaurant sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| And I think we need to be careful on the distance we travel on this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:46| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have something on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| Anyone else have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7250)|
| 2:01:01| I'm Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| In addition to the mulch business, I like to piddle in real estate a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| I've owned billboards that have leased from me and I've had signs, leases and on-premise and off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7270)|
| 2:01:19| And I just wanted to submit something while we're on this digital billboard issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| that a lot of people aren't weighing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| I like to trade in real estate a lot and I've got some land along I-40 in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:37| not far from Turkey Creek with a lot of interstate frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| I currently don't have any signs on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| but I know a lot about that traffic flow around the Turkey Creek area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| It's one of the reasons I invested in that area to buy land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| Knox County has the great benefit of having the second highest traffic count in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| from the 40-75 split to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| That little area down there from Paper Mill down to Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| that's the second highest traffic count in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Now, I think we could all agree that there are some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| that digital advertising is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| But there are areas, surely somewhere in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| where digital advertising would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| And I would submit to this body that if anywhere in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| digital advertising is appropriate, it's the second highest traffic count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| which happens to be in Knox County along I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| If we get too overblown with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| we're going to take away the digital advertising from the highest traffic count there is for 100 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| And there's a lot of people like me that I invested a considerable sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| so I bought a quarter mile of frontage of property down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| I've got roughly 30 acres of land down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| There's a lot of people like me who invest for this exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| There's a lot of businesses that will not build without the proper signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| There's a lot of businesses that will not come to this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| if they cannot get the appropriate exposure from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| And those businesses want that corridor for their developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| Now, this might be self-serving because I know that there will be some big business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| trying to buy my property someday and build a big Walmart or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| And they'll want a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| They might not build there if they can't get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| And if there's anywhere in the state of Tennessee that digital advertising is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| it's on the second busiest traffic stretch in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| And if it's not appropriate there, then where is it appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| It's appropriate nowhere in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| You know, being in business, a sign is one of the most important things for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| Take yourself, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| I'm sure you've been going somewhere hunting for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| And what do you look for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| You look for their sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| But this does take in a lot of things, like Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| You know, even the state has gone to having messages on the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:29| I was on 640 yesterday and it told about a wreck at the I-75 in the 640 exit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:41| And what that did was it leads you to get off to avoid this traffic jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| So, you know, we could be opening up a can of worms like Mr. Anders says here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| There's some things that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| I don't know how that would affect the state if we banned this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| but they have them all over the interstates now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| The federal government does, telling you how far it is to such and such a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| and how many minutes travel time is here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| And then they warn you about wrecks ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| And Amber Alerts, they do a lot of things on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| So, you know, times are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| I'm not saying I'm for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| I don't know how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| But we do need to take into consideration and leave this up to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| because they have the right to deny a sign or approve a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| So we need to leave it up to them to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| Nick, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| I know you all are tired and I'm tired as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| So I'm going to make this as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| Commissioner Hammond, I accept your apology on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| Can you just name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Nick McBride, Chief Deputy, Norris County Register of Deeds, 400 Main Avenue, Suite 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| As the ongoing debate surrounding constitutional offices has continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| this is just kind of for some information that we want to let the commission know where our office stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| And I will make this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| There has been some requests from several members of this body for clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| as who should set policies and procedures for these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| It is the registrar's position that such clarity should be established as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| However, the registrar's office would like to call several issues to the attention of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| To begin, our operating budget is already subject to the approval of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| We feel that there's been some misrepresentation of this fact to the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| and we just want to set the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| Further, all purchasing that is done by our office, including the use of our P-card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| are done through Norris County Purchasing and the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| With regards to employees and salaries, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| the registrar enters into the agreement with the county mayor for our positions and our salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| and that the registrar has cut positions since she has been in office in our salaries agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| She has cut four positions since taking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| She has no salary increases, bonuses, or incentives that have been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| that have not been approved and given to county general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| It has been expressed intent of the registrar's office to maintain transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| and accountability to this body, the county mayor, and to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| Each month, as I mentioned earlier, we provide a detailed financial report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| of all the transactions and all the payroll of our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| which is given to the county mayor, to the commission office, and to the county auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| In addition, we're proud to say that we have turned over our county payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| In summary, it is our position at the registrar that our office has cooperated fully with this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| to a degree that has afforded this body the appropriate level of physical oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| of budgetary procedures and that no further action, resolution, or charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| is necessary to maintain an appropriate level of oversight by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:54| With regard to policies and procedures of the Register of Deeds office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| it's the position of the register that the duties of the office are clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| and specifically prescribed by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| Nearly 90% of the revenue that we collect is state revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| It's extremely important that uniformity be maintained across our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| in the operational procedures and fee structure of the Register of Deeds office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| It is important that the same body oversee the operations of those 95 registrars' offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| We believe, as has been expressed by the State Attorney General's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| that it was clearly the intent of the Constitutional Convention in 1978| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| to maintain constitutional offices and their relative duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| even in counties that have adopted alternative forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| Go ahead, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| Dr. Briggs, you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| Just so everyone knows is that we already have a moratorium on all new billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| and we also have a moratorium on electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| What we're really talking about here that Commissioner Norman brought up deals with the on-premises signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| One of the problems that we have here in the county and in the city is that they're not obeying the present ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| Every time you see one that starts scrolling across, it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| Every time you see it changing, I forget what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| It's either six seconds or eight seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| It's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| And what's happened when you talk to the enforcement people on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| they do not want to, because there's a lawsuit right now between Lamar against the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| and everyone's sort of waiting to see how that comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| But the signs that are up now, I don't know what percentage of them are that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| but just when you go home tonight and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| most of those signs are completely illegal the way they're acting and functioning right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| And with what Brad Mays just said, I think he also made a very good argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| If this is one of the most heavily traveled corridors in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| it's a good reason to keep the billboards out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| What we have in East Tennessee is something that very few other places in this country has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| and it's a lot of natural beauty that attracts people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| Now, if we want to look like downtown Los Angeles or we want to look like Las Vegas, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| But what makes us unique is our natural beauty, and that's a gift that we've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| And I think we have an obligation to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| If you look at what people are coming to East Tennessee for, it does deal with tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| and it does deal with our natural beauty, and that's another reason why we need to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| I agree with that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| And then the only thing that I would add is that the moratorium, that's what I'm looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| is during the moratorium, what do we have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| How are we developing policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| Are we starting to clarify that for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| And I agree with Mr. Anders about some of the business concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| But, indeed, I think I never thought I'd see the day where Tennessee would take smoking out of restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:10| But I think we've progressed greatly in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| And I think this is kind of a similar type of thing, especially on a local scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| for us to be thinking about what we really value, what's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| There is a business value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| It's an economic driver for us to not be cluttered with what I consider visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| Now, that's in the eye of the beholder, and a lot of people don't consider it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| But I think it's something that we need to deal with and we need to get clarity on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:50| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| Yes, is Mr. McBride still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7912)|
| 2:12:08| Hey, thanks for staying so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| I just wanted to let you know and please convey to Sherry that I think she's doing a fabulous job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| and I think she set a really good example for other office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| And the concern is not Sherry and what Sherry has done or hasn't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| It's Sherry can only serve two terms and who's going to come in after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| And my feeling is that there needs to be oversight and guidelines in place, not for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:42| but for future registers and property assessors and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| So I appreciate what Sherry's done, and my quarrel isn't with Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| It's just that I'm looking at the future of Knox County government, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| and want to make sure that future registers continue to do the same thing that Sherry's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| I'll pass that along to her, and I do appreciate your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| but there are 95 registers across the state that adhere to state law, and there's no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:14| But they don't have a charter form of government either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| Shelby County does in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Tom Weatherwood is the registrar down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| He's a great elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| I think the citizens of Knox County, when they elect our officials, we've learned in this last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| we have a very informed constituency out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| And, you know, I feel confident that when they go to the ballot box that they will elect qualified individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| to run the Register of Deeds Office, commissioner, the county mayor, or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| And leave them without oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| We have plenty of oversight, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| We have plenty of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| I don't think you'll find anything more transparent than the way that the Register of Deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| and our financials and everything else are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| There's a difference between transparency and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| But we also don't want micromanaging either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Sherry Witt was elected to do a job, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| Again, we aren't talking about micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| We're talking about policy, good, thoughtful, reasonable policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Yes, next month we're going to have before us the election of two judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:24| And I know that you all have been, because I've been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| and I'm sure we've all been contacted about people that are interested in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| and have been applying for them, applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| I received a letter from the judges with a list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I guess their approved list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| But I'm wondering if this body needs to have a public hearing to hear from those applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| so that we can interview them and hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| And as chair of the judicial committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| I would like to know when people would like to have that hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| so that I can schedule a meeting prior to our next month's commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| so that we can make an informed decision next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| Do we still have that fourth slot open from one of these rooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| We'll be, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| They're using that for vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| He just said the vehicle meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| They're using that for vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Well, we could do that if everybody wishes to do it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| and we'll inform those that have applied that that's the day and they need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:33| Is that the wishes of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| Would that be following the vehicle meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| Do you need a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| What time is the vehicle meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| We have the meeting from 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| If you guys want to do that first and then you can leave and we can do vehicles, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| You let me know and I'll get with Jolie and we'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| I'll tell her what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| We've already got the room reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Did we pick 10 o'clock because the room wasn't available earlier than that or why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| I think we just picked that time because we didn't want to be here earlier, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| Those of us that go to work at 4.30 in the morning, I mean, I'm not complaining too much about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| but 10 o'clock is just right in the middle of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| You tell me a time that you would like, Commissioner, and we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| I prefer, I mean, don't tell me what time I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| I'd say 6 o'clock, but 8.30 would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| I can manage 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| We'll start this meeting through the traditional commission at 8.30 on June the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:43| Does that sound good with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| 8.30 a.m. June the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Was that okay with you, Amy, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| It's a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| Just tell her it's a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| She'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| It's for public hearing for everybody except for Ms. Workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| And then the requested vehicles committee meeting will be at 10 or immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| Immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Jolie, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| And if you'll send that notice out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| And if you will also contact all of those that have applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| although I'm not sure that anybody that's applied that's not within that approved list by the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8238)|
| 2:17:27| I don't know that they need to be here because they may not even be eligible because we passed a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:34| Mr. Law Director, the judges have put forth a list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| They've sort of pre-approved it to be able to serve in that capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| so we would not need to expand the hearing beyond those names, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| So just those that are on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| I just wanted to add the next redistricting meeting, I had a note on my desk up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| whatever this is, for June 2nd at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| I just wanted to let all of you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| I'm sure there's going to be an e-mail sent out, but just give you all a little heads up on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:23| Did you have something else, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| I wanted to remind everybody that the softball championship is Friday, June 5th, beginning at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8308)|
| 2:18:38| We play that first game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| It's at the West High School Field on Tyson Park, which is up behind the skate plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:48| We are playing the school board in the first game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| We win that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| We will play whoever wins between NPC and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| We will win that game, and then we will play whoever wins NPC city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| Also, June 27th are the dragon boat races, and I'm putting together a county team for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:13| We need at least 22 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| It's an all-day event, but it's going to be lots and lots of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| And they provide the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| All we have to do is get in and paddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| July 11th is the Epilepsy Foundation's mud volleyball tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| We're going to have a commission team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:59| It's going to be in Nashville this year, and it would be a shame to miss it since it's so close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:10| Do they have adult beverages at this dragon race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| I will bring beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| Amy, I think Lumpy wanted to sit in the back of the boat on the dragon race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| It's very ambitious to think you're going to get 20 of us rowing in the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:29| Any of you all haven't given Michelle or me five bucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| We need it for incidental supplies, and I need $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| Is there anything else we need coming before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| Seeing none, meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part2?start=8442)|
