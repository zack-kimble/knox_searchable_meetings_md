| 0:04:11| and historic architecture of neighborhoods. Emergency preparedness. How to get along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=251)|

| 0:06:17| agenda. It looks really, really good. And it has been a long time since we've had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| here, and I know the ones in the past were really informational. So I think this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| great thing that you all, I know you've had a team that's put that together. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| a planning committee of neighborhood leaders, both city and county, working on this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| we have, we're really blessed because over 125, there are over 125 speakers and presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=395)|

| 0:06:50| and Urban League groups who are providing volunteers. And if someone forgets the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| address or your number, they can call 311 to get the information? They can call 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| yes. Okay, great. Councilman Della Vopi? Thank you, Mayor. Of course, I know I speak for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| my colleagues when I thank David and his office and the city for doing this. I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| to mention that neighborhood groups, if you're out there listening, that there are sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| going on simultaneously. So please, don't just send one person. Send several representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| There's a great opportunity to kind of sharpen your toolkit for how to deal with city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| how to make your organization work. And you're going to hate to miss some of these conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| and some of these sessions. So bring several folks to it, and split up the day if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| to, morning and afternoon, but attend. It's really going to be worthwhile, I think. Very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| good advice. And I know council will help spread the word among the neighborhoods in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| your district and anybody in the audience who are out watching on TV. Please help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| get the word out on this. We want to see you there. Thank you, David. And thanks to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| of the team that's worked so hard to put this together. I also want to announce that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| will be participating in a groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow at 1.30 p.m. for University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=479)|

| 0:08:13| financing and then subsequent some public infrastructure that we are providing as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| part of this project. This is a $65 million project, urban retail complex on a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| brownfield site. So we're inviting everyone to come out for that. That is Wednesday, tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=507)|

| 0:08:46| park and how to get there. Okay. And finally, next Tuesday, March 12th at 12 noon, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=526)|

| 0:16:01| people in favor of it and listening to those people that are not in favor of it. So this is just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| very beginning. It's like someone outside said this is a baby step. Number one. I see. OK. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| then I'll remove my questions then for now. Thank you. Thank you sir. Nobody else. OK. All right. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=971)|

| 0:18:08| I wonder if the chief would tell us a little bit about this because this is this is trying to address according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| at least the information sheet. The problem we have a large large trucks coming through Knoxville on our interstates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| and the potential hazard that you have to contain if something happens. But I think it's a matter of public interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| and I hope you would. Yes. Thanks for asking that. Yeah. We do have a lot of trucks. Obviously we have two major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| interstates running through here. We have a large petroleum terminal on Middlebrook Middlebrook Park. So therefore we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1112)|
| 0:18:42| have a lot of trucks coming and going through there. And we also have a dedicated hazardous materials team that responds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| to that. We also respond to regional incidents outside of Knoxville. We also have a dedicated hazardous materials team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| in Knoxville City also. And this is to just give us updated training on that. And it's also being the part of it's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| funded by the Petroleum Terminal Association. So they see the importance of this too to provide us this updated training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you much for that. OK. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| And so ordered. Eleven F is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation if necessary of attractive real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1158)|

| 0:19:40| have it. And so ordered. Eleven G is a resolution to waive city of Knoxville taxes on surplus county properties pursuant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Tennessee code annotated 67 dash 5 dash 2 25 0 7 B 5 and 67 dash 5 25 0 8 D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| Move for approval. Second. Councilman Dela Valle. Yeah I wonder if Jim York is here or David. He is. Jim as you're coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1195)|
| 0:20:04| down if you would just tell us a little bit about this. We have a list of I don't know about six or seven properties but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| obviously this is part of that new act we passed to to enable us to sell property rather than hold on to it when the you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| know when the when the liens for taxes build up to being more than it's worth. But you can tell us a bit more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| and how it works. OK. Jim York finance director for the city. What this is is this is part of our agreement with Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| County. Both of both parties both Knox County and the city of Knoxville do obtain properties through tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1231)|
| 0:20:42| Oftentimes those properties would be what we'd consider underwater and that the taxes and interest and penalties are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| than what the property is worth. As part of our efforts to turn these these properties back into onto the tax roll. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1248)|
| 0:21:02| we have agreed to waive our taxes and then sell them for what the true market value of those properties are. And we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| share proportionally in the proceeds from those sales. You let the auction determine the real market price of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| properties and don't worry about the your finger on the lever with the tax. In a tax sale the city or the county both have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| bid in both all the existing taxes as well as interest and penalties. And so that's why we end up holding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| This just enables us to sell those at true market value and put them back on the tax rolls. And so thank you very much for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| that. Thank you Jim. Thank you councilman. OK we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| The ayes have it. And so order 11 H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and all documents necessary to apply for and accept the 2014 Internet Internet Crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Against Children grant in the amount of two hundred forty thousand dollars from the Tennessee Office of Criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1317)|

| 0:22:12| Move to approve. Second. Councilman Dell about me. Yeah I think it's worth asking Gary Price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| if he would from the police department if he would tell us a little bit about this is obviously a program that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| ongoing and I know that Knoxville has been sort of a lead agency in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| But one of the things it mentions in here as you discuss what it's about is that we're funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| two full positions and I'm wondering what happens when the money dries up if it dries up from Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| in terms of how we manage our business. Yes sir. Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| There are actually two primary funding sources for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| One is federal grants. This particular item deals with a state funding mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| It's an allocation from the state legislature. They actually allocate to Knoxville Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| and Memphis for the three regions of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| But it's handled like a state grant would be in terms of application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Now the two positions would be two sworn positions that are actually part of our authorized strength of 416 that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1393)|
| 0:23:23| They're not in addition to that. They're part of the. Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| If the funding went away our normal funding for those positions would take care of those two slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| That helps. Thank you very much. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1423)|

| 0:24:50| but the reports I'm getting from Chilhowee Park and others are that that they're doing a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and they want to actually upgrade some of the some of the service items at the auditorium Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| Greg you have something to add. Actually I think deputy to the mayor Eddie Mass is going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Yes I'll address that. It is part of an agreement. I think it's a five year agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| it started with one hundred thousand dollar investment and then it was seventy five thousand dollars twenty five thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| and then an additional twenty thousand. So as part of that extension they're they're making twenty thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| in capital improvements for this one year extension that will include an ice maker some stainless steel sinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| and and I hear from what I understand that they are doing a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| The food is great. So we're getting good reviews from ovation. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| The only way we make money at those facilities is any ticket proceeds where it's a show that the city sponsors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| the parking garage and the concession. So to help offset the cost of running those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| concessions is an important leg of the stool. And so it's important to have a good contractor in there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1557)|

| 0:26:45| So yeah. And you know from the workshop the other night we're just going to send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| to get all the language and get everything. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| So make the motion to just refer back to refer to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| OK. We have a motion and a second to refer this back to MPC Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| We do have all the notes that need to accompany this going back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| so that we don't keep reconsidering this for several more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1633)|

| 0:27:28| Thank you. Good point. OK. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed. The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1653)|

| 0:27:43| development in some residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| I would move for approval and then I would like to offer something if it gets a second. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| OK. We have a motion and a second. We also have people to speak. Do you want to hear them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Let me let me offer an amendment before I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| OK. And that would be the amendment would be to remove our one a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| zone or one correct. Yes I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Second. OK. So we have a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| amend. I mean a motion to amend which would be to remove our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| one a councilman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you. Second on that right. We got a second from from Mr. Marshall stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Yeah I think that when we had the workshop the other day that that was one of the major comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| It was also a comment made before MPC by several of the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| I think that based on the discussion I sat through anyway and listened at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| the workshop that folks want to step in this a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| quietly and calmly because there are questions about what happens to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| versus medium density residential courtyards allow more density and we didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| to rush into putting that into the zones that that have more single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| housing. And it may be something that gets expanded in the future but it didn't seem like a good place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| start. I think that issue and and possibly the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| of more standards like we have in the historical zoning area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| not that those would be the same things but but standards that that could help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| good courtyard development. And I think I saw a bulletin board over there. Some of the examples that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| MPC came up with after our workshop that helped us all see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Obviously if they turn out good it's a wonderful addition to to Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| communities and if they are done poorly or without careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| workmanship and standards they might detract from neighborhoods. So that's that's my read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| of what happened at the workshop anyway. So I'm going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| We do have some speakers lined up. Is that correct? We did. After those speakers I would like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| Councilman Delavo's comments and the workshop. We have another. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| want to speak now or wait till after that? You can wait and take the vote after they speak. That's right. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| We'll speak after. OK. I have two people signed up. First is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| Nice to see you here. Miss Davis please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| And as you know you have up to five minutes. Thank you. Charlotte Davis 104 Crawford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Good evening. I attended the workshop last week and I've given a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| of thought to the discussion concerning courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| and I don't believe that this type of development will fit into our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| I can't visualize up to 12 houses being 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| apart. What if your neighbors on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| either side or both sides have barking dogs crying babies young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| children getting into it as children normally do or if your neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| has a car with a loud muffler going to work at six o'clock in the morning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| coming home at midnight. You can't always choose who your neighbors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| I believe that any one of us would prefer to have our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| further than 10 feet from our neighbor's homes. I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| we don't need smaller homes for some of our citizens but why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| not just build small houses on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| Personally I would like to see this table. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| if you vote to try courtyard development I hope that you act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| on Councilwoman Palmer's suggestion to have eight homes rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| than 12. And also remember Councilman Adele Volpe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| suggestion to build one unit of courtyard homes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| then we could better visualize we would visualize rather than we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| would see rather than visualize eight to 12 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| 10 feet apart. Thank you. Thank you ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| The next speaker is Miss Terry Faulkner. Terry you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| the rules. I won't repeat them. You've been here. Thank you. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| Terry Faulkner. 4178 Ridgeway Lane 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| And I never take an opportunity that I never miss an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| to say thank you. And tonight I'd just like to publicly thank someone that Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Cree forgot to thank. KUB has donated 13 trees to be added along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| the Third Creek Ringway behind the UT athletic fields. And that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| be Thursday an Arbor Day event at one o'clock. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| anyway we want to thank KUB for helping beautify our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| I'm speaking as the president of the Bearden Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| the council voted to support the courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| development ordinance if the R1A is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| removed. And thank you Councilman Saunders for voting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| So that is our position on that. And that's and I was afraid I sent my email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| too late for everyone to get it which is why I'm taking your time now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you very much Miss Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| OK Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. We had a workshop Thursday that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| really examined this courtyard development fairly carefully. I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| when we asked NPC to look into it and they have come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| with their look. And quite frankly I'm not at all comfortable that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| as a council we really understand and know enough about the courtyard concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| to be taking action at this time. I think there are some really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| positive components to the courtyard development. I think there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| legitimate concerns that some folks have expressed. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| talked about maybe trying just one development and seeing how that flies. But you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| undo an ordinance as easily as you can do one. So I'm going to I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| we need some outside expertise. I'm not discounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| NPC but I think we need some third party expertise either from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| the UT Planning Department or from MTAS that can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| us better understand how this might go. We got some photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| from NPC of two story houses. Other places I've looked at this it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| always been one story and it's really been directed towards seniors. So I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| don't think I know enough about this and I'm not confident that my fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| council members really know enough about this. A few years ago a different council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| looked at a development called the Town Center and that was the latest thing and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| was it. And it was a great concept. It was wonderful on paper but it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| didn't exactly fly well and certainly didn't fit with development plans even before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| the recession of 2008. So I would ask my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| to table this so that we have an opportunity to get a much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| understanding and then we can bring it back out, take out what needs to be taken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| develop some standards, see what kind of standards need to be developed rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| just blindly voting on something that we think we know something about but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| maybe we don't know enough about to be making a sound decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| Okay, there's a motion to table. Is there a second? Second. We have a motion and a second. That's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| priority motion. If you want to speak to that then, Councilman. Yeah, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| speak to that. I agree with Councilwoman Palmer. You know, the photos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| look nice and what have you but I can also see some really shoddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| developments happening. I like what Councilman Della Vopi said in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| you know, we need to define exactly what can go in there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| it could really turn into some just shoddy development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| and a lot of that could go in places where it would be very detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| to the neighborhoods and weaken them even more. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| just, I'm just not ready to pull the trigger on it. I think it's something I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Councilwoman Palmer again that we need to hastily move into this. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| there's a huge groundswell of developers that are waiting in line to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| start this type of development. So, I'm going to support the tabling motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| and just see where it goes from there I guess. Councilman Wallace. Yeah, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| you. Well, I've thought about this a lot. Obviously, I'm in the residential real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| business, lifelong resident of Knoxville and studied similar projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| around and participated in the workshop last week. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| very opposed to it being an R1A. I think that would be a huge mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| But I really don't think we're ready for this. I think the limited appeal to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| courtyard development opens up the unintended consequences of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| what Vice Mayor just said of opportunity for poor development in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| the wrong, in the good areas in the wrong development. You already have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| opportunity to have according to what's in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| The R1, the RP1, RP2, RP3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| already allow a type of housing similar to a courtyard development. And there's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| little of it. The traditional neighborhood development, there are a few of those around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and they've had limited success in holding values and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| in selling out from the beginning. And courtyard development is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| variation of that that I believe would just not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| much success. I think you're opening up a whole new zoning for something that has very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| appeal and will have very little traction. And you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| other opportunities and other style developments. And I'm fine with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| table net, but I'm opposed to moving forward on the courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| Mayor Brown. Yes, Mayor. Thank you. I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| the increased density in an urban setting and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| or not that is such a good thing. Because when you have increased density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| it brings on other problems. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| somewhat in agreement with what Council Member Palmer has said. We may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| need to take a little more better look at it. But I just wanted to say I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| very concerned about the increased density. Thank you. Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Mayor. I respect very much my colleagues' caution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| cautious approach to this. I would ask, and maybe this is a question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| law director. I'm kind of looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| a time period or an agenda of where we're going. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| is it that we don't know that we need to know? Can we set a limit that this may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| brought off the table and back for our consideration? Or I'm just trying to figure out the steps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| get this back in front of us. Just to explain how motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| tabling works. If the motion for putting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| on the table passes, then we would have to have a motion to take it off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| So what would happen is somebody who wants to take it off of the table, who has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| whatever they want to do after it is on the table, then really would call my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| and say, I would like to move to take this off of the table. So we would put it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| put this item back on the agenda, along with motion to take off the table. It would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| before the Council, and then the Council would vote whether or not to take it back off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| That is in distinction to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| the motion to postpone for a set time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| I guess that's where I was going, because I'm trying to figure out, is there a limit? And I guess for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Councilwoman Palmer, maybe I should address my question to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| My thought was that we would table it for the time being, arrange to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| a workshop, because it will take some time to get some outside experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| ready and set to go. We do that, and then if we want to at that point, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| untable it, bring it back out, make the amendment, do whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| If we know that we need some new standards, we can send it back to MPC with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| recommendations. But that we would have some time and not feel pressured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| and certainly not have this scheduled with another topic at a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| so that we had a full 90 minutes to devote to learning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| people in planning or MTAS who really understand this and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| what the ramifications are, what are the positives. And we may decide at the end of that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| this is it. This is the best thing that we can do in zoning in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Or we may ask ourselves, what in the world? Or we may just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| move forward. But I really, this was my thinking, that we need some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| I'm trying to table it to buy time, knowing full well that that doesn't vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Because from what I'm hearing tonight, I kind of think this could go down the drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and that may not be where we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| If I may, that Ms. Palmer, you and I team up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and get with MTAS, get with MPC, whatever expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| we can find and arrange those workshops so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| we can at least figure out whether we want to do something with this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| If that is the wish of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| I would be very happy to work with you, Councilman Saunders, on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| On many matters, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| This is the one that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to make sure that it doesn't die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| In other words, that the intent here is to keep it alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| But I agree with Councilman Della Vopi, one of the things I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| are the standards and the design standards that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And I didn't know whether we send that back to MPC. I like your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| But I just want to make sure and publicly make sure that we don't let it die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| that this is not an end run on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Well, this is why I suggested tabling, because I don't want it to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I don't want to send anything else back to MPC without really specific instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| about how we want this to look when it comes back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| because we've had that conversation with Mr. Donaldson and others at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| that we send things back with this vague whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| and it comes back and we're still not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| So this would give us an opportunity to work with some outsiders, work with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and then get this fine-tuned or kill it off, whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| But I definitely don't want to see this die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| I want it to have some time to be looked at carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you. Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Well, I certainly have to agree with my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| because we spent probably the bulk of the time on Thursday talking about what will it look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| how do you picture this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| And, you know, the devil's always in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Does it turn out to be a neighborhood-enhancing tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| or does it turn out to be sort of a neighborhood-destroying tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| and we certainly don't want the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| So if we have a mechanism for looking at it, I think it's a good idea that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| I don't know if we should engage MPC to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| or engage somehow the developer community to come in and talk to us at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| so we can get input not only from design professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| but on the ground practical folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| But there's been a lot of good points raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| including the fact of what do you do when the kid's going crazy ten feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| I mean, maybe waking you up when you don't want to be woken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| I certainly respect everything everybody said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I mean, I'm actually okay moving forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| You know, I think, you know, you can sort of imagine the worst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| we're limiting it to R2, which already allows dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| You know, there's all types of terrible development, you know, around this county, apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| I just don't see this as that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| I mean, I haven't lived in a single-family home since, I guess, the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| So, I mean, just coming from my background, I mean, I've got people below me and next to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| and, you know, there's all those types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| But, you know, I think as a city, we're not annexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| We're not really growing, and we've got to look at the different tools we can use to grow our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| And I see this possibly as one of them, and we're trying to make our neighborhoods more desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| Throughout my entire life, all the growth has been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| The housing side of the city is growing tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| We need to look at the tools we can use to bring people back into our neighborhoods, the neighborhoods we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| And I think this could be a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I'm okay with moving forward with it tonight, but I understand it doesn't look like that's where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| We have a motion and a second to table this 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130305?start=2780)|
