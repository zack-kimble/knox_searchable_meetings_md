| 2:37:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9434.42)|
| 2:37:15| Questions first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9435.42)|
| 2:37:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9436.42)|
| 2:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9437.42)|
| 2:37:18| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9438.42)|
| 2:37:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9439.42)|
| 2:37:21| Trustee Biggs, how many seniors are currently participating in the property tax freeze program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9441.38)|
| 2:37:25| we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9445.66)|
| 2:37:27| 4789.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9447.66)|
| 2:37:30| And how many, if approved, how many new seniors do you expect to participate, or do you project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9450.94)|
| 2:37:36| to participate in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9456.42)|
| 2:37:38| The new program should add around 5,000 seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9458.1)|
| 2:37:41| What's the fiscal note, or the estimated cost, because that's going to be 5,000 less tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9461.54)|
| 2:37:47| collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9467.18)|
| 2:37:48| So is there an average or an estimate of what that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9468.82)|
| 2:37:52| The estimate right now that we're looking at is given that it was just a brand new reappraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9472.78)|
| 2:37:57| year, it's going to stay where it's at, it just depends on if the property assessor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9477.58)|
| 2:38:00| office does a reappraisal and it goes up or down, or if there's any tax increase or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9480.58)|
| 2:38:04| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9484.1)|
| 2:38:05| Director Caldwell could also probably help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9485.1)|
| 2:38:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9486.1)|
| 2:38:07| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9487.1)|
| 2:38:08| Wait, I didn't, it was hard to hear, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9488.1)|
| 2:38:11| So is there, is there not, you're saying there's not going to be a fiscal impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9491.74)|
| 2:38:16| There will be, depending on later use, whenever there, if there's a reappraisal, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9496.82)|
| 2:38:21| specific instances that take care, take course through county commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9501.46)|
| 2:38:25| Okay, and the fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9505.779999999999)|
| 2:38:29| So technically, until there's a reappraisal, there is no lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9509.34)|
| 2:38:35| And so you lose money during reappraisal, because those values go up, and you lock it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9515.46)|
| 2:38:41| in a certain, so you really don't truly know, because you don't know what the value's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9521.3)|
| 2:38:46| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9526.060000000001)|
| 2:38:47| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9527.060000000001)|
| 2:38:48| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9528.060000000001)|
| 2:38:49| I guess I, in doing this, did somebody do some sort of calculation to say, of 4789 seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9529.060000000001)|
| 2:38:58| currently there's an average value of X on their price, and look at the last reappraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9538.74)|
| 2:39:03| to kind of, I mean, ultimately this will be, you know, what will it, we average, not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9543.82)|
| 2:39:10| say it's not a good program, but you know, this is the first thing that's had a fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9550.060000000001)|
| 2:39:13| impact that doesn't have a fiscal note attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9553.74)|
| 2:39:15| So I'm trying to just better understand, when you add 5,000 more people, what will that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9555.699999999999)|
| 2:39:20| look like to generate, you know, or to take in less tax collection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9560.5)|
| 2:39:25| So I'm just wondering if anybody did that calculation, or trying to just do a broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9565.619999999999)|
| 2:39:29| estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9569.78)|
| 2:39:30| What, what we could do is we could get the numbers crunched in my office, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9570.78)|
| 2:39:35| going to sound bad, but unfortunately some of these elderly people will be passing away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9575.02)|
| 2:39:38| and whenever something like that does happen, it goes back and reverts back to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9578.699999999999)|
| 2:39:43| status, and then the tax freeze is no longer applicable to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9583.38)|
| 2:39:46| So it's for the property that that person is now, if someone goes into assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9586.82)|
| 2:39:52| or a retirement home, obviously it will no longer be attached to that property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9592.18)|
| 2:39:56| So as soon as it ends up a new owner, it goes back on the tax rate as full value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9596.939999999999)|
| 2:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9600.699999999999)|
| 2:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9601.699999999999)|
| 2:40:02| And one thing to keep in mind, too, Commissioners, you know, the income level is pretty low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9602.699999999999)|
| 2:40:09| so we're not collecting a whole lot of property tax per individual or family on this for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9609.9)|
| 2:40:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9617.699999999999)|
| 2:40:18| Depending on what type of house they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9618.699999999999)|
| 2:40:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9619.699999999999)|
| 2:40:20| Well, I don't think they're going to be able to afford a whole lot for, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9620.699999999999)|
| 2:40:24| It's just, you know, something to think through down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9624.18)|
| 2:40:26| But if you could, I mean, this isn't an actuarial table, just like we do in a retirement thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9626.5)|
| 2:40:31| to try to determine how many people are going to be alive, and how long is it going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9631.02)|
| 2:40:34| Just trying to get a better sense of this, just to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9634.34)|
| 2:40:36| I do think it's a good program, and I'm happy to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9636.86)|
| 2:40:39| I just wanted to, if you can start thinking about what that list is going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9639.539999999999)|
| 2:40:43| I guess, four years from now, three, I'm assuming that would be four, depending on if they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9643.539999999999)|
| 2:40:49| That would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9649.14)|
| 2:40:50| I do find it interesting just that, like, that this resolution is actually, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9650.14)|
| 2:40:55| calls out that the value of today's dollar is 68%, is only 68% of the value of a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9655.98)|
| 2:41:03| dollar in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9663.42)|
| 2:41:05| So, it's, we don't talk about that with budgetary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9665.380000000001)|
| 2:41:08| We just went through a whole session of budgetary numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9668.74)|
| 2:41:11| We're literally about to pass a resolution that says, we recognize that since 2007, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9671.62)|
| 2:41:16| value has dropped to nothing, but when we talk about roads and paving and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9676.62)|
| 2:41:19| else, we don't, we seem to ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9679.86)|
| 2:41:21| So it's, I find it interesting it's in here, but thanks for your work on it, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9681.62)|
| 2:41:25| those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9685.82)|
| 2:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9686.82)|
| 2:41:27| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9687.82)|
| 2:41:28| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9688.82)|
| 2:41:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9690.66)|
| 2:41:31| I just wanted to tell the Mayor and Mr. Biggs, thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9691.66)|
| 2:41:35| I appreciate this, and I would gladly support it, and ask to be added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9695.46)|
| 2:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9700.26)|
| 2:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9701.26)|
| 2:41:42| Everybody good to add full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9702.26)|
| 2:41:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9706.26)|
| 2:41:47| Commissioner Daley, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9707.26)|
| 2:41:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9712.82)|
| 2:41:53| Dustin, this is a yearly application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9713.98)|
| 2:41:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9717.539999999999)|
| 2:41:58| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9718.539999999999)|
| 2:41:59| You know, it's just not one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9719.539999999999)|
| 2:42:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9720.539999999999)|
| 2:42:01| You've got to do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9721.62)|
| 2:42:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9722.62)|
| 2:42:03| And sometimes if Social Security increases, it knocks a large amount of people off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9723.62)|
| 2:42:07| program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9727.060000000001)|
| 2:42:08| And out of that 4,800 or whatever, I would say some of them forget year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9728.060000000001)|
| 2:42:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9734.380000000001)|
| 2:42:15| We send reminder notices, but unfortunately right now we're at about 350 to 400 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9735.380000000001)|
| 2:42:19| that fall off the program a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9739.460000000001)|
| 2:42:22| That's usually due to passing away or going into an assisted living facility or things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9742.42)|
| 2:42:27| of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9747.26)|
| 2:42:28| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9748.26)|
| 2:42:29| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9749.66)|
| 2:42:30| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9750.66)|
| 2:42:32| What is the minimum age requirement to be able to apply for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9752.66)|
| 2:42:35| Sixty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9755.94)|
| 2:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9756.94)|
| 2:42:37| So we don't have 35-year-olds out there that are applying for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9757.94)|
| 2:42:41| That's for low-income seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9761.18)|
| 2:42:42| Just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9762.18)|
| 2:42:44| It's for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9764.06)|
| 2:42:47| Not speaking for myself or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9767.18)|
| 2:42:50| There is no minimum age requirement for the Disabled Veterans Program that we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9770.74)|
| 2:42:55| So if anybody knows any veterans or disabled veterans, I would love to be able to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9775.7)|

| 2:45:12| came about because of some conflicts between the way the Commission, the old Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9912.1)|
| 2:45:18| was handling school board matters. Basically, under state law, once you have budgeted funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9918.380000000001)|
| 2:45:25| to the school board, it's up to the school board to decide how to spend those funds as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9925.82)|

| 2:45:36| power of this Commission to affect that. The only reason we have these items on the Agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9936.42)|
| 2:45:41| is because our Charter says that the Commission has to approve all contracts over a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9941.66)|
| 2:45:45| level. So, to be consistent with the state law and with our Charter, we have these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9945.86)|
| 2:45:52| So, that's why they're there. They don't need to be voted on except as a general consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=9952.26)|

| 2:54:21| this all occurred, actually, was because I got a phone call from Mr. Tim Hill, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10461.560000000001)|

| 2:54:53| sat down and came up with some recommendations. You all should have a copy of the latest red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10493.26)|

| 2:55:46| speak to you. Sorry, came in late in the game, was out of town, saw the article in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10546.66)|
| 2:55:55| the paper, and here we are. But just a few general comments, questions I think I posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10555.66)|
| 2:56:03| to some of you all is how big a problem is this? We've been putting drive-throughs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10563.66)|
| 2:56:08| CA and CB zoning for years with no regulations. It's not rocket science. You know, Chick-fil-A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10568.66)|
| 2:56:16| or McDonald's or Starbucks or whatever, there's, and those guys know drive-throughs, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10576.66)|
| 2:56:26| say, Chick-fil-A, better than any of us. They've hired all the best engineers and architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10586.66)|
| 2:56:33| in the world, and they know how to do their drive-throughs. And so I would hate to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10593.66)|
| 2:56:38| that we get in the way of them doing what they know how to do. Secondly, I don't recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10598.66)|
| 2:56:43| this body really debating drive-throughs over the years. I've been developing for 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10603.66)|
| 2:56:50| now. I don't remember this being some big problem, and so are we over-regulating something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10610.66)|
| 2:56:56| that just naturally takes, you know, makes sense? And we all know we wouldn't be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10616.66)|
| 2:57:03| today without drive-throughs getting through COVID. You know, if it wasn't for drive-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10623.66)|
| 2:57:08| we would really be in up the creek. And so I would just say that this is more government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10628.66)|
| 2:57:18| and not less government. And so that's just kind of generally the comments that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10638.66)|
| 2:57:27| Globally, on the red line document, I think we just wanted to address that McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10647.66)|
| 2:57:35| doesn't have a problem with Chick-fil-A's drive-through, or if they're located next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10655.66)|
| 2:57:40| to industrial use or even a multifamily use. You don't have any debate. I think the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10660.66)|
| 2:57:47| issue is, does it affect a single-family home? And so we made that proposed carve-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10667.66)|
| 2:57:54| in the document that you have that these standards would come into play if you are adjoining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10674.66)|
| 2:58:02| if a commercial lot is adjoining a single-family home. You know, in all the property that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10682.66)|
| 2:58:10| own in the centers, I've never had old Charlies complain about Chick-fil-A or whatever. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10690.66)|
| 2:58:18| so we just don't see that as being necessary. One of my most recent developments out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10698.66)|
| 2:58:26| front of our target, you know, we spent six or eight months getting through a use-only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10706.66)|
| 2:58:30| review because it had a drive-through. And so at the end of the day, it ended up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10710.66)|
| 2:58:37| what we proposed originally. So, you know, the issues that I saw that the staff, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10717.66)|
| 2:58:48| was the noise, lighting, and a buffer is needed when you do have these standards, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10728.66)|
| 2:58:55| are next to, say, a single-family residence. So we've tweaked on those some. Be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10735.66)|
| 2:59:02| answer any questions or discuss any parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10742.66)|
| 2:59:11| Thank you. Thank you for that. I do believe since this red line has occurred that it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10751.66)|
| 2:59:18| has, I know that I sent a copy to Mr. Stone and also to Knox Planning. Jim, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10758.66)|
| 2:59:28| come forward? Do you have any comments, suggestions, or recommendations on this that you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10768.66)|
| 2:59:34| are appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10774.66)|
| 2:59:36| Yeah, and I would, from my perspective, being the party that has to enforce these standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10776.66)|
| 2:59:42| I think I need to be pretty neutral in this matter and not really take an opinion one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10782.66)|
| 2:59:48| way or the other in regard to the Planning Advocates' comments or Mr. Graham's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10788.66)|
| 2:59:54| I would say that if this body wanted to consider Mr. Graham's suggestions, that I would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10794.66)|
| 3:00:04| it. Those changes are pretty significant, so I think that might require that red line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10804.66)|
| 3:00:12| to go back to Planning Commission. But as far as my opinion in regard to the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10812.66)|
| 3:00:18| comments, I would be hesitant to offer really any, just because my department does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10818.66)|
| 3:00:24| to enforce the standards. I don't think it would really be appropriate for me to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10824.66)|
| 3:00:28| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10828.66)|
| 3:00:29| All right. All right. Thank you. One discussion that I do believe occurred, and I think, Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10829.66)|
| 3:00:37| you and I, and I think you've talked with some other commissioners also about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10837.66)|
| 3:00:44| the concern that was presented was it was like a who is here first that you might address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10844.66)|
| 3:00:52| and perhaps if you wanted to consider any change along that regard as far as having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10852.66)|
| 3:01:00| a single family lot next to you as opposed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10860.66)|
| 3:01:05| Sure. And that's probably a reasonable request that maybe a platted lot that's part of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10865.66)|
| 3:01:14| new subdivision or subdivision, you know, maybe that, you know, even though that lot is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10874.66)|
| 3:01:20| to be generally pretty close to your main roads, that would probably be reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10880.66)|
| 3:01:28| not only just a single family home, but a single family lot that has been platted. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10888.66)|
| 3:01:35| think it can... Y'all can narrow the definition or broaden it as you see fit, but that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10895.66)|
| 3:01:43| makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10903.66)|
| 3:01:44| All right. All right. Thank you. That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10904.66)|

| 3:01:52| Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to first thank planning staff. I don't know if they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10912.66)|

| 3:02:02| As Mr. Murphy stated, a little bit of background. This came out of conversations when the John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10922.66)|

| 3:02:16| with more uses for commercial properties. And in that discussion, we acknowledged that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10936.66)|
| 3:02:23| we had not really looked at drive-thrus. And one thing to consider is with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10943.66)|
| 3:02:29| coming out of advanced NOCs, we will see probably more recommendations and suggestions for mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10949.66)|
| 3:02:37| use and town centers. And so this is something that will be on our radar. I'm sure we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10957.66)|
| 3:02:43| have to look at some of these uses. And so it's important to have something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10963.66)|
| 3:02:51| You know, I had a lovely conversation with Mr. Graham. I understand his concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10971.66)|
| 3:02:55| his comments. I told him, you know, you're kind of coming in at the 11th hour. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10975.66)|
| 3:03:00| been talking about this for like four months. And he explained to me he had been traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10980.66)|
| 3:03:05| and out of town. And so what I'm willing to do, and I hope the body is willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10985.66)|
| 3:03:11| is to send this back to planning and have a conversation that includes Mr. Graham, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=10991.66)|
| 3:03:20| Murphy, engineering, planning, and myself. Because, you know, we like to say we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11000.66)|
| 3:03:26| married to things. I'm kind of married to this. I mean, I was, you know, a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11006.66)|
| 3:03:30| effort. And so I think it's important. I don't want to minimize it. I don't want to water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11010.66)|
| 3:03:36| it down. But I do want to hear his comments and take those into consideration. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11016.66)|
| 3:03:43| know, I think that's where we are now. Again, I want to remind everyone, this went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11023.66)|

| 3:03:54| again, as a courtesy, I'm willing to send it back if the body agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11034.66)|

| 3:04:05| Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree this is, Mr. Snowden, too many changes. It needs to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11045.66)|

| 3:05:07| family. So if I own a piece of agricultural land, and I don't have it plotted for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11107.66)|
| 3:05:14| houses or whatever, and then you buy the property next door to me and want to put a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11114.66)|
| 3:05:19| to it, hasn't that devalued my land the way it's written here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11119.66)|
| 3:05:26| So you're saying it's agricultural versus...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11126.66)|
| 3:05:29| Well, it doesn't matter. It could be RA, it could be whatever. Well, RA would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11129.66)|
| 3:05:34| Well, we were strictly thinking about residential, i.e. multifamily, when we changed it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11134.66)|
| 3:05:43| residential to single-family, because a lot of people look at multifamily as some form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11143.66)|
| 3:05:50| commercial or whatever, and apartments, people are there 6, 12, 18 months and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11150.66)|
| 3:05:57| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11157.66)|
| 3:05:59| Your question is a legitimate question and probably should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11159.66)|
| 3:06:05| Well, if it goes back to planning, that would be one question that I would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11165.66)|
| 3:06:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11169.66)|
| 3:06:10| I mean, it's not a deal-breaker or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11170.66)|
| 3:06:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11172.66)|
| 3:06:13| It's just clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11173.66)|
| 3:06:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11174.66)|
| 3:06:15| I did have a phone call about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11175.66)|
| 3:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11176.66)|
| 3:06:18| I'll admit I haven't thought of everything on this, but so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11178.66)|
| 3:06:24| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11184.66)|
| 3:06:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11187.66)|
| 3:06:30| I'm glad this is going back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11190.66)|
| 3:06:32| Mr. Snowden, I did want to ask, is there been a problem with this in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11192.66)|
| 3:06:38| I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11198.66)|
| 3:06:41| No, there hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11201.66)|
| 3:06:42| We were talking about that today in our CODES meeting, and historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11202.66)|
| 3:06:49| we haven't had a lot of complaints from drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11209.66)|
| 3:06:53| We do get complaints about light trespass and noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11213.66)|
| 3:06:56| but historically, they've not been really voluminous from a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11216.66)|
| 3:07:02| It's more of a situation where, you know, it's not been drive-thru uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11222.66)|
| 3:07:09| So, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11229.66)|
| 3:07:11| I went around the barn to say no there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11231.66)|
| 3:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11233.66)|
| 3:07:14| I just understand the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11234.66)|
| 3:07:18| I just didn't want to get into over-regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11238.66)|
| 3:07:22| If there's not a need, why would we do that, absent there being a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11242.66)|
| 3:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11248.66)|
| 3:07:30| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11250.66)|
| 3:07:31| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11251.66)|
| 3:07:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11252.66)|
| 3:07:34| This is a question for Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11254.66)|
| 3:07:36| What would be sent back or sent back to commission planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11256.66)|
| 3:07:40| the most recent red line or the original or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11260.66)|
| 3:07:44| And what are we asking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11264.66)|
| 3:07:47| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11267.66)|
| 3:07:49| Thank you, Commissioner Jay, for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11269.66)|
| 3:07:51| We would send back the current version that you all have already approved on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11271.66)|
| 3:08:00| and then we would take into consideration the comments and concerns of Mr. Graham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11280.66)|
| 3:08:08| to possibly then present back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11288.66)|
| 3:08:12| So we're sending them both versions and saying, look, here's current and suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11292.66)|
| 3:08:19| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11299.66)|
| 3:08:20| Go through the process and figure out how to either meld the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11300.66)|
| 3:08:23| or send us back something that's a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11303.66)|
| 3:08:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11306.66)|
| 3:08:27| And they could say, we're fine with it as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11307.66)|
| 3:08:30| And so we just, as a courtesy, we're sending it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11310.66)|
| 3:08:34| so we can take into consideration his concerns and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11314.66)|
| 3:08:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11318.66)|
| 3:08:39| I think as long as both are sent back and we don't start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11319.66)|
| 3:08:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11322.66)|
| 3:08:43| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11323.66)|
| 3:08:44| We're not starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11324.66)|
| 3:08:45| We are sending the current version back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11325.66)|
| 3:08:47| We are taking into consideration those comments that have been submitted by Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11327.66)|
| 3:08:51| We will have a great conversation about his concerns and hopefully find some middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11331.66)|
| 3:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11341.66)|
| 3:09:02| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11342.66)|
| 3:09:04| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11344.66)|
| 3:09:06| Amy, if I misspeak, you just say I did, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11346.66)|
| 3:09:12| This came about the Alcoa Highway Corridor study, which was business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11352.66)|
| 3:09:17| When all the neighbors got together and had probably five, six meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11357.66)|
| 3:09:24| Mr. Snowden probably didn't get any phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11364.66)|
| 3:09:27| but there at the Hardee's that is closed down, they had a loudspeaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11367.66)|
| 3:09:34| and I got phone calls from that neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11374.66)|
| 3:09:37| I mean, they were right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11377.66)|
| 3:09:40| So, yeah, was there issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11380.66)|
| 3:09:43| Nothing major, but, yeah, you're living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11383.66)|
| 3:09:47| and you hear Hardee's loudspeakers at 11 o'clock at night for giving me the Hardee's Jr. or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11387.66)|
| 3:09:58| Yeah, it is not a major problem, but it was a problem to those neighbors around Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11398.66)|
| 3:10:05| And we can fix that by the noise level, DBAs, which Mr. Graham has already suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11405.66)|
| 3:10:11| So that was, I wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11411.66)|
| 3:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11416.66)|
| 3:10:17| Any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11417.66)|
| 3:10:21| Well, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11421.66)|
| 3:10:28| So, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11428.66)|
| 3:10:32| That was by Commissioner Frazier with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11432.66)|
| 3:10:36| Move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11436.66)|
| 3:10:42| It has to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11442.66)|
| 3:10:46| So, seeing there's no more discussion, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11446.66)|
| 3:10:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11451.66)|
| 3:10:53| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11453.66)|
| 3:10:57| That moves us to public forum on open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11457.66)|
| 3:11:00| We have one person signed up, Mr. Dubrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11460.66)|
| 3:11:02| If you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11462.66)|
| 3:11:04| State your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11464.66)|
| 3:11:07| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11467.66)|
| 3:11:27| I'm Dubrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11487.66)|
| 3:11:30| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11490.66)|
| 3:11:33| I've got a different train of thought here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11493.66)|
| 3:11:39| Let's back up to Sheriff Spangler's video where he showed his officer getting assaulted in the pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11499.66)|
| 3:11:51| Let me fill in the blanks of what you did not see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11511.66)|
| 3:11:56| That being the psychiatric pod, what happens is you get a lot of people in there that's medicated through Helen Ross Benal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11516.66)|
| 3:12:06| And once they get behind them bars, they don't get their medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11526.66)|
| 3:12:13| They beg in these guards to get their meds, and they get talked to like dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11533.66)|
| 3:12:23| So what happened, you seen it where this officer got assaulted for ignoring an inmate crying out for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11543.66)|
| 3:12:34| And you didn't see another officer restraining his assailant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11554.66)|
| 3:12:41| You seen another inmate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11561.66)|
| 3:12:44| Now, the part you didn't see is God only knows what happened to that young man once the guards got their hands on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11564.66)|
| 3:12:55| Now, here you are with a standing room only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11575.66)|
| 3:13:00| They wanting raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11580.66)|
| 3:13:03| And everybody out here wants more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11583.66)|
| 3:13:07| But law enforcement from the East Coast to the West Coast, everybody's in the crunch because of what you see happen right there in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11587.66)|
| 3:13:19| It is an absolute nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11599.66)|
| 3:13:23| Young Mr. Thompson, dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11603.66)|
| 3:13:26| Miss Lisa Edwards, dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11606.66)|
| 3:13:30| It was a young couple that was killed in a police chase by the sheriff's department last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11610.66)|
| 3:13:38| Nobody wants to say a word about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11618.66)|
| 3:13:41| Their family begging for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11621.66)|

| 3:14:38| When you have public officials with that kind of power saying that they don't want to touch the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11678.66)|

| 3:14:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11697.66)|
| 3:15:00| We are now to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11700.66)|
| 3:15:07| So discussion of our May agenda zoning items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11707.66)|
| 3:15:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11710.66)|
| 3:15:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11712.66)|
| 3:15:13| We have a total of six items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11713.66)|
| 3:15:16| Fifty percent of those were approved on consent from the planning commission of the basically the eight that are left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11716.66)|
| 3:15:25| There's only six individual ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11725.66)|
| 3:15:29| So if the commissioners that want to discuss those like it's number sixty two and sixty three, which is in commission district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11729.66)|
| 3:15:40| You've got number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11740.66)|
| 3:15:46| Well, we could start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11746.66)|
| 3:15:47| Sixty six is in commission district six and I think the restaurant district seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11747.66)|
| 3:15:53| And eight, six, seven and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11753.66)|
| 3:15:58| So I'll be glad to tell you the numbers as we get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11758.66)|
| 3:16:00| But if there's nothing relevant, then we can just just say nothing relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11760.66)|
| 3:16:08| So we're talking about number sixty two and sixty three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11768.66)|
| 3:16:19| Commissioner Hill, would you like to make any comment regarding yours on sixty two and sixty three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11779.66)|
| 3:16:27| These are district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11787.66)|
| 3:16:29| They really should be yours because the lines are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11789.66)|
| 3:16:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11795.66)|
| 3:16:36| Because they are right on the property line of the township.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11796.66)|
| 3:16:42| Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11802.66)|
| 3:16:45| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11805.66)|
| 3:16:46| And really, this just can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11806.66)|
| 3:16:49| I will let you address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11809.66)|
| 3:16:51| I know that they have some very real concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11811.66)|
| 3:16:54| Part of this does not really coincide with what the township of Farragut would desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11814.66)|
| 3:17:05| There is density around it that is equal to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11825.66)|
| 3:17:09| There's also density around it that is considerably less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11829.66)|
| 3:17:14| So it's they they've looked at the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11834.66)|
| 3:17:24| Road improvements that we deal with seem to coincide with as fast as we can get a road improvement planned or even on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11844.66)|
| 3:17:36| Then immediately the development starts and then the planned road improvements justify development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11856.66)|
| 3:17:45| So I certainly understand both sides of that equation, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11865.66)|
| 3:17:51| But Mr. Schoonmaker, do you have anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11871.66)|
| 3:17:57| As I said, I know this is your your Farragut town that's taking it very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11877.66)|
| 3:18:03| Yeah, I do think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11883.66)|
| 3:18:05| Their administration sent a letter to Knox, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11885.66)|
| 3:18:11| I don't know if Amy remembers that or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11891.66)|
| 3:18:16| But anyways, yeah, they're just concerned about it backing up to the town of Farragut limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11896.66)|
| 3:18:22| And that letter, by the way, was never posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11902.66)|
| 3:18:24| So since it wasn't addressed to me, even though it's in my district, I think that's a little bit of a yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11904.66)|
| 3:18:34| Because they figured laundry also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11914.66)|
| 3:18:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11917.66)|
| 3:18:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11925.66)|
| 3:18:46| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11926.66)|
| 3:18:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11928.66)|
| 3:18:49| Just to that point, I did reach out to the town of Farragut because if you will notice under the GDP, it does state that this is the Farragut urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11929.66)|
| 3:18:57| And any time we have something like that on our zoning agenda, I try to be a good neighbor, good steward and reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11937.66)|
| 3:19:05| And they did send a letter, Commissioner Hill, and they do have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11945.66)|
| 3:19:12| And I will I will make sure that you get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=11952.66)|

| 3:20:40| I will say there's nothing in the area that that looks anything like an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12040.66)|

| 3:23:31| So I don't particularly have any issue with it since it's the traffic studies suggested there's not going to be any change going from eight to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12211.66)|
| 3:23:40| And it's already approved for eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12220.66)|
| 3:23:42| So as long as the traffic study supports that, I don't really have an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12222.66)|
| 3:23:47| So you said the traffic study supports the 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12227.66)|
| 3:23:50| From what I was told that the traffic study says going eight to 12 is not going to affect anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12230.66)|
| 3:23:54| And Mr. Snowden can talk to that planning or at next week's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12234.66)|
| 3:23:59| But what I was told that the traffic study suggested it was not going to affect anything is in significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12239.66)|
| 3:24:08| And also Crescent Ridge just got Crescent Apartments just got built down the street, which is like massive apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12248.66)|
| 3:24:15| So it's hard to say they can build a massive apartment complex and you can't build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12255.66)|
| 3:24:20| It's supposed to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12260.66)|
| 3:24:22| I talked to the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12262.66)|
| 3:24:23| I talked to a couple of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12263.66)|
| 3:24:24| It's supposed to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12264.66)|
| 3:24:25| There's the guy next to him is supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12265.66)|
| 3:24:28| The neighbor is supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12268.66)|
| 3:24:29| The neighbor wants him to build it because it's going to increase their land property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12269.66)|
| 3:24:32| So there is in support for it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12272.66)|
| 3:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12276.66)|
| 3:24:37| Mr. Schumacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12277.66)|
| 3:24:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12278.66)|

| 3:24:44| And it's is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12284.66)|
| 3:24:47| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12287.66)|
| 3:24:48| I think he has a contract on other parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12288.66)|
| 3:24:53| But I don't know if he's buying them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12293.66)|
| 3:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12296.66)|
| 3:24:57| So that's not going to be where I didn't ask him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12297.66)|
| 3:24:59| We just talked about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12299.66)|
| 3:25:00| I didn't ask the individual part in three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12300.66)|
| 3:25:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12303.66)|
| 3:25:04| And it's basically in the middle of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12304.66)|
| 3:25:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12307.66)|
| 3:25:08| From Ebenezer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12308.66)|
| 3:25:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12309.66)|
| 3:25:10| The Westland Drive is the main artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12310.66)|
| 3:25:11| And it goes out to our big four lane arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12311.66)|
| 3:25:14| So and also the railroad tracks right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12314.66)|
| 3:25:16| Which if anybody that lives in West Knoxville knows the train goes right through there at four o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12316.66)|
| 3:25:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12321.66)|

| 3:25:29| I don't have an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12329.66)|
| 3:25:32| We need housing, especially in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12332.66)|
| 3:25:34| You cannot move into the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12334.66)|
| 3:25:36| It's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12336.66)|

| 3:25:50| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12350.66)|
| 3:25:51| No issues with 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12351.66)|
| 3:25:53| It's just a down zone to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12353.66)|
| 3:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12355.66)|
| 3:25:56| 76 and 77?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12356.66)|

| 3:26:06| That's the one that was deferred for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12366.66)|

| 3:26:16| I guess if he doesn't, it will automatically defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12376.66)|
| 3:26:18| If he does, he may not even want to pursue it any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12378.66)|
| 3:26:23| 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12383.66)|

| 3:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230515?start=12406.66)|
