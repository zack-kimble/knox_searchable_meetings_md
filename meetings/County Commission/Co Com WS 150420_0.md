| 0:01:11| The item number four, resolution memorializing Richard Behler, defer until next meeting or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=71)|
| 0:01:22| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| And also, I'd like to add a resolution honoring the Carter High School existence of 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=84)|
| 0:01:33| That's to be an add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| I want to defer item number five until the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| Commissioner Brolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| The discussion item on the preparedness, yeah, the Family Safety and Emergency Preparedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| Fair, we'll do that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Are you not prepared to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| No, I can go ahead and do it, but I think you'd rather hear from the other people about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Not a change in today's, but just looking ahead for next week, if you looked at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| beer board agenda, there's no way we're going to finish that in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| And it's too late to make a change on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| So, are we going to run it right through the commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| The beer board will end and then commission will begin after that's concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Because there's 13 violations on the beer agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Actually, we've got 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| There's an extra piece of paper in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| I would want you to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| The records office has prepared that on Raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| And I'm going to take a fairly strong stand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| So, study that, please, before you come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| On what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Raceway, on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Oh, on Raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Sandra prepared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| So, make sure that you do at least read that addendum to your agenda there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Yes, I'd like to pull item number 30 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| In going along with that, pulling 30 off, I sent an email earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Items not on consent are 8, 18, 31, and 32, and now 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=216)|
| 0:03:45| Is there any other items you'd like to pull off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| I lost my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| I thought it was number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Yes, number 9 on the cost of those coupon books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| That will be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Sam wants to pull something off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Sam's talking to us from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Make a motion we add all that needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=267)|

| 0:04:40| It's for purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| It will allow them, I think, to buy a forklift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=285)|

| 0:06:18| Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I'm here today on behalf of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| At the time when the County Industrial Development, the agendas were due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and the County Industrial Development Board was meeting, the timing didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| But we do have two names I passed out to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Ms. Lynn Akers and Ms. Tamara Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| And I did pass out to you today resumes and bios on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I don't know if they were able to attend today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| I'm looking around and not seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| But they are aware of the actual commission meeting next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| and will be there to answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| They're both excellent candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| I would remind you all, though, as commissioners, this is your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| If you had someone else that you wanted to nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| or bring to the table for consideration at next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| certainly that's your choice to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| And we've had good commissioners that have come from nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| that have been presented as well as from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| So I'd be happy to answer any questions if anyone had them about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| This is to fill out the remaining three years of Mrs. Dawson's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Any questions for Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=446)|

| 0:08:07| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Or is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Is there a first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Yes, I just had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| If somebody from the schools wants to come down, I guess that would be Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=497)|
| 0:08:32| Evening, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| When I look at that figure, that's a lot of money for printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| How many books do we print?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| About 160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| 160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Where is this Walsworth Publishing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| We don't have anybody locally that can publish these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| It's a bid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And to my knowledge, as I recall, and purchasing may be able to help on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Walsworth was the only bidder on the contract, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| They're located in Missouri, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| and they are the previous holder of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Is it a contract that somebody locally or that anybody else could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| We've had people bid on them in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| but the issue comes down to not necessarily can I print the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| but can I cut the books and cut them in such a manner that they're neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| and don't have the spines broken when we get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| How many of this 160,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| What's the average sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| You ordered 160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| How many of them do you average selling each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| It fluctuates from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| I can't tell you the exact amount of the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| but we'll gross between $1.5 and $1.7 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Then you can take that off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I just wanted some information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| On page five, item number 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| is a resolution approving a contract for the survey mapping and GIS work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| necessary to comply with the MS-4 requirements of the State of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Department of Environment and Conservation NMPDES general permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| for stormwater discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| The contract also includes additional work to provide detailed condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| assessment of all culverts greater than 48 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| Resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Dr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| I know we had a number of blanks on the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| We'll just ask you to move this forward without recommendation until Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| but we do have final negotiations with the vendor complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| We have a vendor selected that is GRW,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| and we can either give you a little bit of background on it today if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| maybe speak things up on Monday, or we can just talk about it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| Let him talk five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| You only got five minutes Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Is there anybody that's got any questions in regard to the meeting Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Yeah, it's going to be a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| If you've got any questions at all over the week, give them to Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Describe the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Give us some background information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| The selected vendor is the firm of GRW,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| and they will be using a series of subcontractors, most of whom are local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| including Cannon & Cannon, Benchmark Associates, and Vaughn & Milton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| And the gist of this is that we are required by our NPDES permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| to map all of the stormwater and drainage infrastructure that is owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and maintained by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| This contract is the first phase of two and far and away the biggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And GRW and the subcontractors will come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| and they will actually map using GIS technology all of the berms, swales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| catch basins, pipes, headwalls, wing walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| and all the drainage infrastructure of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| The contract has a not-to-exceed amount of $2.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and the successful respondent was selected by a committee that purchasing supervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| We had purchasing, stormwater management, highway maintenance, KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| and Knox County IT because there's a big data set that comes with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| And we would anticipate that we'd take the deliverable by October 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I should mention that besides permit compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| some of you probably assume we already have this information, and we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| It's vitally important to us from a highway maintenance standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| to know what our inventory is, where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| what kind of condition it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| It helps us from a spill response standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| If you have a tanker truck overturn, water goes into a roadside ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| it gives us information about where those contaminants are going to flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and what our cleanup efforts need to be and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| I could talk about it for hours, but I'm not sure anybody wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Is this greater than 48 inches in diameter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| What if they're rectangular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| In other words, anything with that much area or greater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| I'm thinking the one under John Sabir Highway is a rectangular duct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| I think it would be captured by the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Then I've got two on my little half-mile road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Anything within the public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| a data point will be collected and photographs will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Condition evaluations will only be done on the larger structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| because what we want to look for is the potential for culvert collapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| and things like that so we can go ahead and take maintenance efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| to prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| In fact, in anticipation of the data that we're going to get from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| in the FY16 budget we're going to include a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| or have included a request for some monies to maintain culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| that are found to be in a condition that needs maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| so that we can go ahead and address those issues before we get a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| I need a motion to move that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| I move to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I'm going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Really what I said a moment ago was make him talk five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Don't let him wander away because now the question is coming to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| As we're speaking of stormwater discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| and you gave all those technical terms about land formations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| to control stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| what's the dividing line between what will be surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| and what may not be a part of our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| or are we going to take everything as a part of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| even though it may be bankrupt or not complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| In this initial phase we're going to capture everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| that's within the limits of the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Including streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Yeah, roadside ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| anything that's within the limits of the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| If you want to get into more of the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| why don't we let Tracy Jones come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| She's done yeomans work with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| It's been a big and complicated project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| and they've worked for months on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| There are two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| This is the initial phase and the bulk of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| This is the urbanized area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| and that's the most of what we're concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| There's going to be a subsequent phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| where we get into the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| and that will be a much smaller scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Not much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| We anticipated it at about a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| but it's potentially a year or two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Let me let Tracy give you an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| of what it is we're going to do in this first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| In the first phase we're just going to do the urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| That's based off of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| We are, like Dwight said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| we're going to get what's in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| and that would include, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| ditches, culverts, catch basins, weirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| anything like that that the county maintains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| Okay, so my question deals with a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| with a public road where a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| has taken real estate on both sides of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| and may have a catch basin on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| drainage under the road and more riprap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| and more catch basins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Are we only dealing with what's in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| or are we dealing with those other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| that are adjacent to or feeding that or draining that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| The only things that we are going to get off of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| would be if a catch basin drains to a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and then the outlet of the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| would then drain to a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| So to get a full connected network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| to know where the water is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| we would go off of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| to get the detention pond discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| But if the county hasn't accepted the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| and it's not something we're maintaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| then we will not capture it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Okay, I see then that it has to be a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Yes, a county-owned road that we maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| But if it is a county-owned and maintained road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| turned over to the county by a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| then if there is drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| where some of the developers have gone bankrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| will we still be picking that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| We may never have accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| And really where I'm at is Christian Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| We'll talk about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Tracy, we'll need your name and, I guess, stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Tracy Jones, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Any other questions of Tracy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| We have a motion and a second to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| It's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| On page nine, item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| is a resolution opting into the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated 13-3-101J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| and 13-7-106B regarding training and continuing education of professional planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| planning commission members, Board of Zoning and Appeals members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| building commissioners and other administrative officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| whose duties include advising a planning commission or Board of Zoning and Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I was going to make a motion that we send this on without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| since Jeff's not here today and he's the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| But I would be really interested to hear John's thoughts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| since he just came off of BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Well, of course, I'm a big fan of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| and when I first started on BZA I was actually provided training from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| which was very valuable that was put on by the CTAS people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| But at first I thought we would be able to make an adjustment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| but since it's actually state law that we're just reactivating or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| we're not going to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| So I think Commissioner Smith, did you want to add something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Yeah, I just wanted to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| and I agree with Amy to defer it without recommendation to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| But I wondered, we've been without this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| I think it was the Ash administration that opted us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| and we're fixing to appoint a new MPC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and I'm just wondering if maybe we'd be better off not trying to micromanage this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| and wait until someone's in place and get their feel on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| We have a motion and a second to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| We'll see without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| In regards to Commissioner Smith's remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| all of these folks would not be coming under MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| although I agree with you in the point that it probably would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| I just want to point out that all of these are not under the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| And Dan's here if he's got anything he wants to add to it about the current training that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1256)|
| 0:21:07| Dan, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Dan Kelly, staff member of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| We are aware of Commissioner Owenby's request to put this item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| and I understand there may be a companion resolution that's going to be going forward at City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| also doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| As a staff, current staff, and we have no issue with the idea of the commissioners opting in for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1290)|
| 0:21:40| It also requires staff training, and since we're dealing with a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| it also brings in the Board of Zoning Appeals and those who work advising the Board of Zoning Appeals also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| But we're prepared to provide the training to the planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| and there's plenty of training opportunities available through webinars and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| The only real issue that we've identified has been it's kind of an administrative issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| in that you have 15 planning commissioners and nine members of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| and you really don't have any way to make them do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| And so you have to keep track of who shows up for each one, each training session, and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| And I don't know what if any penalties, if you want to call it that, or ramifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| or if they don't do the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| But we can provide the training opportunities for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| The motion is to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| I guess for the law department, does this particular Tennessee Code referred to here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| demand that these different categories have this training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| Unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Or is it a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Unfortunately, a lot of times the statute will say that you opt in, meaning you take the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1385)|
| 0:23:14| But if you don't, there's no penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| It's up to this body, you know, what you do with them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| If they don't, you don't have to renew them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| But there's many times in statute where they require training unless a license is attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| or they have some actual remedy associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| But there's a lot of statutes that don't have a solution if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| And I think this is probably one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So right now we're opted out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Right now we're opted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| There's no training required of any of the membership or any of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And through this action you will be opting in, meaning they will be required, theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| to take training that's offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| You got the statute thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1439)|
| 0:24:09| We love well-trained commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Just look at Mr. Busler and Mr. Brown, both matriculated from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Well, we have a correction here, believe it or not, since Jill knows the law on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| They can be removed by this body as their position if they fail to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| So this is one that does speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Doesn't Daniel train or do some kind of training with BZA now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| We do provide some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Daniel provides some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| What would happen here, it would be, as MPC stated, we would have to be able to record, to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| to document, to ensure, which we don't really do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| We're going to have this available to you on Wednesday if you'd like to have it come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| It's more voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| All right, we have a motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| On page 10, item 31, is an ordinance amending Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| entitled Animal Control to amend Section 6-31 definitions by adding the definition of the term extreme weather conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1517)|

| 0:26:23| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| I'm also going to move that we send this on with our recommendation again because Jeff has taken the lead on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| and I think that he needs to be here for any discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| All right. We have a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Okay. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| I would like to, I've had, and I think once the group that come up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| and approached Commissioner Olinby, there's been some discussion in that group with some different ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1609)|
| 0:26:58| And so I'll be sending you that different ordinance over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| the kind of review that I advised them that I would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| or I would send that on to you guys just to kind of look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| And it's different in some ways and the same in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| So kind of put them side by side and look at them, and I'll try to get it out to you this evening or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| So there will be another ordinance because there's two groups that want to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| And so I think it's fair that we place both of them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Is there any other discussion? Commissioner Kilmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Yes. This morning I actually reached out to the animal control office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| to the person that handles all of the complaints, to see if they'd had a copy of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| and they had not seen that yet, so I forwarded them a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| So if you at the same time would send them your copy, because they were going to go ahead and review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and see, since they're going to be enforcing this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| if they're seeing something that we're missing or overstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Did you send it to HUBS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150420?start=1675)|
