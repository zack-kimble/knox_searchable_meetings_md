| 2:19:49| Rebecca, if you would state your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| My name is Rebecca Saldivar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| My name is Rebecca Saldivar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| I'm a small business owner in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| I am speaking briefly today to support no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| to the Board of Health authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| Just like we regulate people wearing seatbelts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| I feel like masks should be regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| or the Board of Health should be able to regulate masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| I personally feel a lot more comfortable going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| if I know I'm going somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| that people are wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| and I will frequent those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| as opposed to other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| where people are not wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| Again, I just wanna support the no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| to Board of Health authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| They are doing an incredible service for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| and I appreciate their service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| and I appreciate your service as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| and that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Thank you, Ms. Saldivar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| Our next speaker is Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| Laura, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Laura?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| You have a Laura Branson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| There's nobody in the waiting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Okay, let's skip that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| Next up is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Sherry, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Sherry, if you would, please state your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| your county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| I live in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| On March 12th, 2020, Governor Bill Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| essentially declared martial law on the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| I quote, today's action will move us into a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| to utilize additional emergency funds as needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| and relax provisions of certain laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| to provide the flexibility needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| to respond to this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Knox County Board of Health has declared martial law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| on the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| Let me define what martial law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| Martial law exists when military authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| carry on government or exercise various degrees of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| over civilians or civilian authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| in domestic territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Tennessee Constitution Declaration of Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| Article I, Section 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| That martial law in the sense of unrestricted power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| of military officers or others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| to dispose of the person's liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| or property of the citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| is inconsistent with the principles of free government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| and is not convited to any department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| of the government of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| So in our Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| martial law is in the sense of unrestricted power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| Unrestricted power is when there is no vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| by representatives, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| Unrestricted power is when there is no check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| and balance of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Many of you don't mind acquiescing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| to the unlawful exercise of power not granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| I contend you acquiesce because you do not know our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| do not understand why we declared independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| do not understand how abuse of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| always escalates and becomes tyrannical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| and oppressive of rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| fought and died for by our forefathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| So in our Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| martial law is in the sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| I think I'll say that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Even better, our founders were wise enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| having suffered tyranny of the crown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| to put in or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| or others is all persons, including governors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| mayors, boards of health, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| and not just military officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| And our founders declared that conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| inconsistent with the principles of free government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| and is not confided to any department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| of the government of this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| I do solemnly swear that I will support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| obey and defend the Constitution of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| the Constitution of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| and the charter of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Now I will faithfully discharge the duties of my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Do you remember this oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| You took it the day that you were sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| So I ask you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| will you have the courage to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| for a foundation in the Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| Or are you so busy keeping your jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| that you're forgetting to do your jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Thank you, Ms. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Our next speaker is Andrew Flores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Mr. Flores, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8668)|
| 2:24:31| and your county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| and you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| If you would turn your, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| There I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| It's Andrew Flores and it's Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| First, I wanna say thank you to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| for hearing from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| And I wanna say Merry Christmas as this week is Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| I do wanna talk about Kyle Ward's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8690)|
| 2:24:55| I think that it really is the middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| This is a middle ground that will unite the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| It is not taking away mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| Mandates will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| It is shifting the power from the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| to the health officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| In this way, you give accountability to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| You also give the people an avenue to pursue recourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8718)|
| 2:25:24| through the mayor's office if there's an actual reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| or if there's an actual cause to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| I hear a lot of people talking about how they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| that the Board of Health needs to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| to have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| And when you look at the Board of Health's power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| you think about it and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| it's unconstitutional the way it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| It is unchecked and has no balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| And that type of power should not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| for any entity at all anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| And so by bringing this, by voting yes for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| and by bringing the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| into an advisory capacity, you have solved that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| And then once again, we're not voting on the mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Those mandates will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| We're not voting on the advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| that the Board of Health is giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| They are top professionals in their fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| and should definitely be giving advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| in times of outbreak or pandemic or epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| But I believe that you are in its basic form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| solving one issue, which is bringing power under check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8795)|
| 2:26:42| and bringing an unconstitutional power that an entity has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| you're bringing that into a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| where the people now have a little more control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| Maybe not all the control, but a little more control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| And so I do hope that you guys will vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| And I do believe this really is the middle ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| even if it doesn't appear that way right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| And there's no better time to take up a position on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| than right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| No better time to make an unconstitutional position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| constitutional than right now at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=8840)|

| 2:31:45| and your county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| Tonight will likely be one of the most significant votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| of your tenure as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| You are confronted with a hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| Some of you are set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| and whether you like the vote you have chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| is nonetheless the one you believe is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| Based on your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9125)|
| 2:32:06| your open deliberations over these many months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| I suspect the commissioners who I sent this email to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| I should say, who have that resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| and have their opinions set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| I'm in agreement with for a variety of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| not all the same motivations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| But there are some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| who have not formed a finalized opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| and you have expressed that they aren't pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| with the structure of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9151)|

| 2:32:36| and how decisions are being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| but they also are conflicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| about removing a Board of Professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| they believe to be acting in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| for the well-being of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| I and many others have been before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| attempting to undermine that last belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9169)|

| 2:32:54| for the good of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| We believe they are manipulated by other factions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| spoon-feeding them only one version of data and policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| such that they are driven to the actions they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| We believe there is an egregious money trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| that exposes the corruption of institutional self-interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| that can exploit plausible deniability to protect itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| We can quote to you Dr. Fauci himself from July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| stating that PCR tests with cycle thresholds above 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| which our health department director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| has repeatedly called the gold standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| are useless, that's Dr. Fauci's words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| in determining an infection by a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| All of this may be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| and it has no bearing on why you should vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| in support of Commissioner Ward's ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| in reference to executive orders has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| government is not free to disregard the First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| in times of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| It goes on to say other things, but that's the heart of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| I think it's more than just the First Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| I think it's all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| Beyond the federal constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| our Tennessee state constitution states in section two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| the government being instituted for the common benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| the doctrine of the non-resistance against arbitrary power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| and operation is absurd, slavish, and destructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| for the good and happiness of mankind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| Section 21 says that no man's particular services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| shall be demanded or properly taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| or applied to public use without the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| and people staying at home to protect the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9268)|
| 2:34:31| is public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| So without just compensation being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| is the Board of Health paying these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| that they're putting out of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| The result of the actions of Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| have demanded the services of men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| When a single mom who depends on tips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| to provide for her children is unable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| to serve a larger number of tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| because of capacity limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| then her services are effectively demanded of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| This might be because her employer has reduced staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| but it is ultimately the actions of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| that have created this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| It is one thing-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| Mr. Hill, please wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| Your time has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9309)|
| 2:35:10| Each of you have taken an oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| to defend the constitution of our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| This is your time to stand and defend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| not only our nation, but our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| There's so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| I hope you read the email I sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| I'm gonna take two more speakers before we break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| and then go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| For anybody who is still on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| that I have not gotten to yet, please hang with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| We will return to this right after our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| The next two speakers are gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Zach Weisfeld and Kim Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| Mr. Weisfeld, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| If you'd turn your camera on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| And if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| and you have three minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| Sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| My name is Zach Weisfeld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| and I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| And I'd really like to thank commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| for the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| As the prior speaker pointed out, this is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| Not sure it's all that important constitutionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| but it is important to our county and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| I'm speaking today in strong support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| of the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| I'm a business owner, I'm a husband, I'm a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| and the Board of Health's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| to mandate our public health policy is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| It's key to keeping my business open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| It's key to keeping my kids' schools open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| and it's key to keeping the health of our community intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9394)|
| 2:36:39| Those who want to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| the board's public health authority are either ignorant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| or have an ideological ax to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| But don't believe for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| that those calling to undermine the authority of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| have our best interests at heart because they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| The board is made up of medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| and members of our community who care about us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| and are doing their best to keep us safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| keep us healthy, and keep us working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| So I encourage all of you to please continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| your support for the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Thank you, Mr. Weisfeld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| Next up is Kim Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| Kim Fortner, if you'll turn your camera on, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9436)|

| 2:37:22| your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| You are muted still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| It may be headphones or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9455)|
| 2:37:45| We are not hearing you, but we are seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| Sorry, we can't hear you, but we can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9475)|
| 2:37:55| Okay, I'm sorry, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9475)|
| 2:38:02| Seth, the audio's connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| Okay, try it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9484)|

| 2:38:10| but we have no audio on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| So if you want to hang with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| we will come back and put you at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9494)|

| 2:38:25| Debbie Stafford, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| You were on the list earlier and then got moved back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| and you may be back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9510)|

| 2:38:48| I haven't been able to go because I had to stay late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| and treat some COVID patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| I'm running behind tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| I wanted to start first by thanking the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| that felt he needed to call names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| to those of us who disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| And secondly, I would like to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9539)|

| 2:39:14| is absurd, slavish, and destructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| of the good and happiness of mankind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| Now, I'm not overtly against the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| As a healthcare professional, I appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| What I'm against is the arbitrary power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| For those like me who didn't exactly know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| what arbitrary meant, I went and looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| Arbitrary means based on random choice or personal whim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| rather than by any reason or system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| What you all do as county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| is based on a system of our county codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| It's based on our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9586)|
| 2:39:49| It's based on the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| What the Board of Health is doing is literally arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| They may pass or demand whatever they wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| with no accountability under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| For each of you commissioners that fail to resist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| this oppression of arbitrary power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| per the state constitution, it's absurd, slavish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9607)|
| 2:40:10| and destructive of the good and happiness of our Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| I don't say this, our state constitution says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| Also, the Knox County Charter in section 1.05,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| rights reserved to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| No provisions of this charter and no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| by any officer or employee of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| acting under its authority shall infringe upon rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| privileges, and powers now or hereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| reserved or guaranteed to individual persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| which are the people by the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| or the constitution of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| Again, our own charter states that none of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| may have arbitrary power over any citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| individually or collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| So each of you as commissioners are directly responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| for resisting arbitrary board that has random choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| or personal whim over our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| An arbitrary board mandating penalties of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| is literally a definition of a fascist action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| What is fascism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| It's an autocratic government which seeks to silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| dissenting thought whose decisions are subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| to neither external legal constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| nor regularized mechanisms of popular control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| The action before each of you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| has nothing to do with anything beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| do you continue to support an autocratic arbitrary board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| or do you support a free government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| with checks and balances in place accountable to the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| Voting to dial back an autocratic arbitrary board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| is an act to protect our rules, laws and government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| I find it interesting someone earlier quoted Merle Haggard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9704)|

| 2:41:49| Merle Haggard, yet I starve myself to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| trying to keep my family fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9711)|

| 2:41:57| We're gonna do one last try with audio from Ms. Fortner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| and then we will take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Ms. Fortner, do you wanna try one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| And if not, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| Okay, if you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| and your county residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| and you have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| Thank you for the second opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9737)|
| 2:42:17| So first, thank you so much to our elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| county officials for their service and their communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| as well as efforts to protect the Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| for your visit to UT Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| and for your brave post regarding the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| of sick inpatients, open to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| We're more concerned than ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| by the increasing numbers of COVID infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| These impact our clinical lives on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| We have seen avoidable closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| and consequences of rising numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| I heard some conversation of capacity not being an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| but it's only not an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| because we continue to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| to change around practice patterns and care patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| and delay surgeries that can be delayed until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9790)|
| 2:43:14| These impact the lives of all of our family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| friends, and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| At this point, our healthcare workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| and our healthcare system are both pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| to the brink of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| While we're eager for the vaccine that will end the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| we also request that we continue to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| to the Tennessee Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| and trust those non-elected public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| and medical teammates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Thank you for your time and for the second opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| Thank you, Ms. Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9822)|

| 2:43:47| that are still in the waiting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9827)|

| 2:43:53| but we do need to recess this meeting to go to zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9833)|

| 2:44:25| We will take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| We will put on putting this meeting in recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| and then we will jump over to the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| We'll start the zoning meeting at 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| So if you would count Knox County IT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| tell our zoning participants that we will start at 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=9878)|

| 2:57:01| You know, there have been several attempts to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| It's lot 19 of the Choteau Mill Homeowners Association subdivision, but it was never developed as a residential neighborhood and there were difficulties in developing it as a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10624)|
| 2:57:19| So it sat there vacant for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| It was ultimately bought in 2016 by the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| And there were several conversations about ways to maybe rezone that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| And none of those were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| With regard to this property, you know, Mr. Brad Pruitt and Mr. Mark Amrine came in and sought to extend the neighborhood commercial zoning with the intent of potentially putting a restaurant, a beer garden on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10651)|
| 2:57:46| However, you know, it's important to note that process will need to be approved through a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| We're here talking about the rezoning process and whether it's a natural extension of the neighborhood commercial zoning that is to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10670)|
| 2:57:59| Planning Commission thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| There was opposition at the Planning Commission level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10680)|
| 2:58:06| Mr. Pruitt and Amrine and their architect, Mr. Ewers, have done a really good job reaching out to the neighborhood, talking about ways they can make accommodations to deal with some of the negative impacts that might come from extending this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10686)|
| 2:58:19| And we have, as I understand, the full support of the Choteau Mill HOA, which is the subdivision that this lot is currently a part of and that would most directly be impacted by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10699)|
| 2:58:33| And Mr. Pruitt may be able to give you more details about that, but I don't know a lot of the opposition that I read in the county commission's packet was back in September while those conversations were ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10713)|
| 2:58:45| And so I hope we've been able to really reach out and to the neighborhood and address some of their concerns so we can move forward with a quality development and follow Planning Commission's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10725)|
| 2:58:57| Brad, do you want to talk about maybe your conversations and your efforts and what accommodations you've been able to to reach with the HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10737)|
| 2:59:06| Sure. Thank you, Ben. And I think Steve Robinson is on here. He's going to talk a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| He says, Steve, I don't want to step on your toes here, but yeah, we met with the HOA, which this lot is actually a part of that HOA, for anybody who's actually seen this come up through zoning before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10751)|
| 2:59:22| Knowing that, going into that, we met with the HOA very early on back in the summer. We've agreed to numerous concessions, which include deed restrictions, monetary supplement for a gate to be put in for the subdivisions, the past few HOAs, physical barrier lines, mature tree lines to make sure that we are a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10762)|
| 2:59:46| In addition, we've also agreed to operational restrictions, early closing hours, which is typical for our establishment anyways. But, you know, in good faith, we wanted to meet with them and try to be the best neighbor we could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10786)|
| 3:00:00| Subsequently, this zoning went through. As of last week, we actually came to a legal understanding and a bonding agreement, and thus getting the 18 support residential approval from the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10800)|
| 3:00:14| Thank you. Is there any opposition? Mr. Robinson, I thought that might be you, but perhaps you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10814)|
| 3:00:21| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10823)|
| 3:00:24| Would you like to add very quickly to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| Mr. Pruitt's gone out of his way to work with our neighborhood. Obviously, we've had a long history in working with this lot. I've been in the neighborhood since the beginning, so 17 years in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10827)|
| 3:00:40| I've been involved in numerous attempts of rezoning, and I will say that Mr. Pruitt came to us early, worked with us to develop something that we felt comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10840)|
| 3:00:53| He proved himself to be what we think will be a good neighbor and a good addition to the business community in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10853)|
| 3:01:02| So the Homeowners Association of the Mill at Choteau is in full support of his project, and we would ask you all to vote in favor of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10862)|
| 3:01:12| Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson. Did Kevin Murphy jump on, or is there any opposition that I'm seeing or hearing? Speak now or forever hold your peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10872)|
| 3:01:23| Okay. Seeing none, I will look to the district commissioner for a motion. That would be Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10883)|
| 3:01:34| Can we go ahead and discuss this before a motion is made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| You need to, well, yeah. Well, tell me, do we need to do the motion and second and then discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| Or in zoning, I think we can discuss first. So, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, I just had to think through that. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to kind of give some quick history because of the extent of the emails and the phone calls and the text messages that we receive from the people of the Choteau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10911)|
| 3:02:06| In 2009, the developers of Choteau Markets, which is the 12 acres that includes the Flygoals, the rural metro fire station, and the Tenova health care facility there, they came to the community and said, hey, they wanted to do neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10926)|
| 3:02:27| And this was the first time a zoning classification was actually designed to back up to residential development. And at the time, the Metropolitan Planning Commission said that they would designate these 12 acres as the neighborhood commercial district for that portion of southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10947)|
| 3:02:49| And that was approved in December of 2009. Then this commission in October of 2018, we revised the zoning ordinance for neighborhood commercial to allow self-storage units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10969)|
| 3:03:08| So they took four and a quarter acres of the 12 acres and are now putting in self-storage units because they could not fill the commercial area there with commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=10988)|
| 3:03:23| So now and they still have room in the 12 acre development to do other businesses that would accommodate the neighborhood commercial structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11003)|
| 3:03:38| So I guess the question is, should you fill up that area first before you jump across the street and start adding on to neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11018)|
| 3:03:48| And I think the people out in the Choteau area, they have nothing against the development team that's proposing this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11028)|
| 3:03:54| I don't think that's ever been a question, but it's been kind of a question that's come up with the HOAs and Choteau fields, which are actually due north of this property and the Montgomery Cove HOA, which is northeast of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11034)|
| 3:04:12| It's unfortunate that when MPC originally did this development for Choteau Mills 20 years ago, that lot 19 ever existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11052)|
| 3:04:25| It probably should have been originally designed as a open space for the other 18 lots because of its accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11065)|
| 3:04:33| And what I said from the get go on this, because there was so much conversation regarding for or against this, that I would base my decision on how I was going to vote by the will of the people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11073)|
| 3:04:54| So basically I have just trying to tabulate everything between emails, phone calls, and verifying the folks that actually live in the Choteau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11094)|
| 3:05:05| I'm about 60 to 65% of the folks who are against jumping across the street to extend the neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11105)|
| 3:05:16| So I'm opposed to this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| But again, I have nothing against the development team that's doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11120)|
| 3:05:24| I understand exactly what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| I'm just laying out the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| And by the way, when the original Choteau Marcus was put in in 2009, I was a neighborhood representative for the Council of West Knox County homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11130)|
| 3:05:42| And I fully supported what John Huber was doing there because I felt that was a viable area for commercial development in those 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11142)|
| 3:05:52| So that people who live down Choteau Road could actually go up on Saturday and get a gallon of gas so they can mow the lawn at the Weibel store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11152)|
| 3:06:00| So anyways, that's all I have to say at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11164)|
| 3:06:05| I see some other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Commissioner Ward and then Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| I live down the road from this area, Choteau area, not too far from here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11171)|
| 3:06:17| I'm just up north shore a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| John, you know I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| I've actually had a little bit of the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11182)|
| 3:06:25| I've had a lot more people call me saying that they're for this, that they want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11185)|
| 3:06:30| I mean, obviously the HOA that backs up to this has said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| I went out and talked to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| I love the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11198)|
| 3:06:39| They're not going to sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| They're going to have basketball courts and pickleball courts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| And it's going to be more of a community area that sells food and some place to hang out and watch a balls game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11204)|
| 3:06:50| So I think for me personally, I would love to see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11210)|
| 3:06:56| I would definitely go and visit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| And I think it's perfect for the people coming off the water, off the marina, want to stop off and see the game afterwards or go there beforehand and get lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11218)|
| 3:07:07| And then go down the boat docks and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| And I think it's a perfect expansion to what we already have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| And I would like to see more of the Chotto Circle concept built throughout the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| I think this is exactly what we need going forward in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| Small neighborhood commercial with nice, beautiful neighborhoods around it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11243)|
| 3:07:29| We're not sending traffic into Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11249)|
| 3:07:31| And we're not sending people down north shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| They can stay right there in their own community, have a nice lunch, play some basketball, watch a game, and go walk home or drive a couple seconds down the street to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11254)|
| 3:07:45| So I think there's not a lot there to begin with to service these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11265)|
| 3:07:52| I think we have one or two restaurants for what is an extremely fast-growing community down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| And I think looking forward when we talk about smart development and traffic patterns and things like that, keeping people in their neighborhoods, in their small communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11277)|
| 3:08:06| And I think that's the direction we need to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| So I will be in full support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11292)|
| 3:08:13| Commissioner Daley, I see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| I'd like to speak to Planning, Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| Are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11301)|
| 3:08:22| He's in South Bronx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Hey, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| Staff recommendation, according to the Sector Plan and changing the Sector Plan, there's got to be certain rules to change the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| It says deny the Southwest County Sector Plan amendment to Neighborhood Commercial because it does not meet the criteria for a planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11315)|
| 3:08:43| Can you kind of go over your reasoning that this does not meet the planned amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11323)|
| 3:08:48| Except for the actual commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| I can review the Sector Plan amendment requirements and just reaffirm that our planning commission did find that there was rationale to support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11332)|
| 3:09:05| But there is four criteria that we review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| So we look at changes of conditions warranting the amendment of the Laney's Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| And staff had found that there were no recent significant changes to the conditions that would warrant a planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11352)|
| 3:09:19| You know, as you know, in the motion made by commission, they did note some of the recent developments that would warrant that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11359)|
| 3:09:28| The second one is introduction of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11368)|
| 3:09:36| Staff found that there were no new roads or additional utilities that have been introduced in this area in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11376)|
| 3:09:42| And the third is an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11382)|
| 3:09:47| There is no significant error or omission in the plan was found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| And then trends in development, population, or traffic that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| Again, staff found that there were no trends in development pattern that would warrant the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| However, again, planning commission did note some of the new developments that have come online in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11403)|
| 3:10:11| What new development has come on in the last three to four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| And when was the last sector plan update for that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11415)|
| 3:10:20| This one was, the sector plan was updated in one of our more recent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11420)|
| 3:10:28| I think it was 2015, but I'll double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| And then the development that was noted by the planning commission was some new condo developments to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11432)|
| 3:10:45| But you didn't, staff did not see that as an obvious error in trends in development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11445)|
| 3:10:53| No, Commissioner, that wasn't part of our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| I try to go, you know, I spoke to the mayor of Farragut and the mayor of Norris County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11460)|
| 3:11:07| We need to get this growth plan started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| But in the meantime, I try to live by the sector plan, and I don't see any reason that we have here to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11469)|
| 3:11:17| And that's going to be the way I stand is that unless Mr. Mullins, are you there, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11477)|
| 3:11:25| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| Can you tell me a good reason that we can, from all the sector plan requirements, can you give me the reason we can change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11486)|
| 3:11:37| Well, I can go back to what the planning commission's rationale was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| Of course, they, you know, listen to staff more often than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| And, you know, they're also familiar with the developments in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11504)|
| 3:11:48| And just due to the success of the neighborhood commercial, due to the, you know, the traffic improvements in that area with the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11508)|
| 3:11:56| due to the development of higher density development in that area that may call for more commercial development to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11516)|
| 3:12:03| they disagreed with staff respectfully that there were not changes in the development patterns in that area that would not justify a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11523)|
| 3:12:14| This is something that was, you know, very thoughtfully discussed among the planning commission and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11534)|
| 3:12:21| and they voted 11 to 4 that there was a rationale to change the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11541)|
| 3:12:28| So I would echo what they have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| And due to the growing area and the need for additional neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| which is intended to be complementary to residential areas, they thought that there needed to be an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11556)|
| 3:12:44| Sure, there might be some areas in the Choteau markets that have not been completely developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11564)|
| 3:12:51| but we also don't have a piece of property that's been sitting vacant and unused that's slightly over an acre right there adjacent to that neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11571)|
| 3:13:00| that would support a use like this and the unique nature of a use like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11580)|
| 3:13:05| So, you know, it was during that conversation that planning commission believed there was a reason to justify the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11585)|
| 3:13:12| at least in extending it to this parcel to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11592)|
| 3:13:19| Ben or Amy or maybe Mr. Snowden, when was the roundabout built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11599)|
| 3:13:28| Commissioner, let me check on that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| Mr. Robinson, I see you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| And I also see Ms. Trento has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| If you have some brief remarks, I might give her an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| I see Commissioner Skidmaker's hand up, but I have a question before that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| So just kind of going around the horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| The area continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| As a neighborhood, we have been through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| Mr. Chairman, I'm waiting on an answer from Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11634)|
| 3:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| I figured we'd hear from Mr. Robinson while Mr. Snowden was checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| We've been through this scenario multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| For once, I was happy to join you guys tonight, thinking that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| we had found the ideal neighbor for us in this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11652)|
| 3:14:18| I can't help but think that if we go beyond tonight, this scenario is going to kick the can down the road even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11658)|
| 3:14:27| We're going to be forced to address this as a neighborhood once it comes back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| This costs us legal fees every time that we have to work on this situation with a new perspective applicant that comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11672)|
| 3:14:43| We finally found an applicant that we're happy with as a neighbor, that we would be amenable to working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11683)|
| 3:14:51| to living next to, and that we don't feel is a detriment to our community and our value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11691)|
| 3:14:58| I think it goes without saying, this area is exploding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11698)|
| 3:15:03| The community is growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| To the end of our neighborhood, Ball Homes has built a large development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11705)|
| 3:15:12| It continues to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| There will be a continued need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| And quite frankly, I feel like it's a matter of time before, whether it's the makeup of this commission or another commission, that approves that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11716)|
| 3:15:26| I'm not a big gambler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| I like the guy I got right here as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| That's who I'd like to stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11731)|
| 3:15:34| Thank you, Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| Mr. Snowden, I see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| We started construction out there in the spring of 2014 and completed in September of 2014 on that roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11740)|
| 3:15:50| So the roundabout was finished before the sector plan update at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| You know, I feel we need to get that growth plan started back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| And the residents out there, they need to put some, call the town of Farragut and get town of Farragut on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11760)|
| 3:16:08| We need to get this so we won't have these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| And hopefully we can get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| But I still see, you know, there's nothing new there that I see that myself warrants a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11776)|
| 3:16:24| And I go by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| In South Knoxville, I tell the neighborhood associations there, we live and die by our sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11786)|
| 3:16:32| So if it's in the sector plan, it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| If it's not, I'll stand with you and fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| So, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| Thank you, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| Before I go back to Commissioner Skinmaker, I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11800)|
| 3:16:46| I went by and I looked at this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| I've actually been by it a hundred times and never really paid attention until, of course, it came up in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| And I'd be hard pressed to figure out another use for this corner lot than anything but commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11816)|
| 3:17:04| I mean, nobody would build a house right on that corner in an acre lot in a neighborhood that's already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11824)|
| 3:17:11| So my understanding is this neighborhood, I believe, Ms. Trento, you are the HOA president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11831)|
| 3:17:21| this is a developed neighborhood with an extra lot on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| And this is not going to be developed into a house of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| You're muted, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| Yes, that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| If you would just state your name and address for the record so we have to make sure we know who everybody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| Phyllis Trento, 12509 Choteau Mill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| When I look at this, I just don't see any other way that you would develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11870)|
| 3:17:56| I can't imagine anybody building a house right in that corner of the roundabout on an acre lot in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| And so we make exceptions to sector plan things all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| And I think we have to think about what is the highest and best use for a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11886)|
| 3:18:14| That's what zoning does, and that's what we do as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| Zach, could you mute Mr. Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| I think somebody's hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| But as a commission, our job is to look at what is the highest and best use and also to what do people have a right to do with their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11904)|
| 3:18:31| I mean, we have property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| And I think the justification, quite frankly, is it's very difficult to say, oh, because there's more room over here, you shouldn't develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11913)|
| 3:18:41| That doesn't have any bearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Somebody has a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11923)|
| 3:18:44| A neighborhood has said we have a partner that we'd like to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11924)|
| 3:18:47| There's no other use for this land other than something commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| And it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| And to hold them up I think is, you know, it's absolutely wrong to hold up somebody from the opportunity to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11933)|
| 3:19:01| So I'm struggling with how would this ever be anything other than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11941)|
| 3:19:06| And if you've got a neighborhood, it is so rare that we have a neighborhood that comes with a developer arm in arm and says we have a good plan and we like each other and we think this is going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11946)|
| 3:19:18| That is like never happens in the history of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11958)|
| 3:19:22| Why would we not consider that as a massive mitigating circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11962)|
| 3:19:26| Mr. Mullins, am I missing something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| You're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| I don't think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| I just wanted to say I think, you know, sometimes when the sector plan gets amended in an area where there has been quite a bit of controversy over expanding a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11974)|
| 3:19:44| that sometimes are a little maybe short-sighted in not expanding the sector plan to allow commercial zoning into areas like this, which is seems to be earmarked for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11984)|
| 3:19:57| I know it was controversial when it happened in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| I know it's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| I think maybe it didn't get changed in 2015 because there was some reluctance to potentially expand that because of the past controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12002)|
| 3:20:11| But this is going to sit vacant and there's going to be somebody else to come along and eventually somebody is going to figure out how to develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12011)|
| 3:20:20| It should be someone that the neighborhood is in support of instead of being opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| I would really ask that you follow the planning department's recommendation to change the sector plan in light of how quickly this area is growing and how there is still a need for not only commercial development, but commercial development of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12026)|
| 3:20:40| One of the things that we have agreed to is to put down deed restrictions that specifically exclude some of the things in the neighborhood commercial zone that the neighborhood might find a little more offensive, such as a self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12040)|
| 3:20:53| So that would not be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| So even if something happens to the beer garden, because we are here on a zoning request, the mantra is you have to consider all the uses before the CN zone, not just this particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12055)|
| 3:21:06| So even if hypothetically something changes, we have protected the neighborhood in doing this in a way that there would not be a use that they would object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12066)|
| 3:21:16| So this makes sense to do this and do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| Commissioner Skinner, I'll come back to you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| I'd like the planning commission to just, or excuse me, planning staff to just for the record state what the recommendation was from the planning staff to the planning commissioners regarding both the zoning, excuse me, the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12086)|
| 3:21:45| So planning commission recommended to, planning staff recommended to planning commission to deny the southwest county sector plan amendment to neighborhood commercial for 1615 Choteau Road because it does not meet the criteria for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12105)|
| 3:22:03| And planning staff recommended to planning commission to deny the CN zoning because it is not consistent with the southwest county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12123)|
| 3:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12135)|
| 3:22:26| Okay, seeing no further discussion, is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12146)|
| 3:22:35| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| Last time this was before us back in, I believe it was 2018-17, there was a request to turn this into office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12161)|
| 3:22:51| And I supported the community, which overwhelmingly did not want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12171)|
| 3:22:57| I think this is a very rare opportunity we have where the people of Choteau Fields get who they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12177)|
| 3:23:05| And I agree with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| This property is going to eventually be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12187)|
| 3:23:10| And I also agree with Mr. Mullins that yes, Choteau Road had just been completed and the sector planning process probably started before it was completed while construction was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12190)|
| 3:23:23| It was probably an area they didn't want to touch at the time because of the recent development that happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12203)|
| 3:23:30| So, I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment as approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12210)|
| 3:23:39| Mr. Smith, a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12219)|
| 3:23:43| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| I see two hands up, but those are the last two people that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12225)|
| 3:23:49| So, are your hands still up or you just happened to click those off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| So, the motion is before us to approve by Commissioner Smith and a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| Madam Clerk, would you – I'm sorry, are there additional hands up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12241)|
| 3:24:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12246)|

| 3:31:26| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12686)|
| 3:31:32| Here on behalf of the applicant, urban engineering and Hunter Harrison, this is for, as you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12692)|
| 3:31:38| aware, development of the property located at 1737 North Campus Station Road in the Longview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12698)|

| 3:31:46| This is approximately 62 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| The incident request is for a sector plan amendment from agricultural to rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| as well as a rezoning for low-density RA to plan residential at a density of up to 1.93| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12713)|
| 3:32:03| growing units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12723)|
| 3:32:04| The initial request by the applicant was a little over three acres, but we are in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12724)|
| 3:32:10| with the planning staff recommendation and the planning commission's approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12730)|
| 3:32:15| planning staff's recommendation at a density of 1.93 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12735)|
| 3:32:19| In regards to the sector plan amendment, as you're aware, there must be certain requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12739)|
| 3:32:24| that must be met and satisfied for this commission to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12744)|
| 3:32:29| Several of those requirements are met with the incident request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12749)|
| 3:32:33| However, only one has to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| As identified in planning staff report, this area, Hardin Valley, continues to expand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12756)|
| 3:32:42| grow, and there is a constant request for or demand for additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12762)|
| 3:32:49| There have been new roads scheduled to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| There have already been new road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12772)|
| 3:32:54| There have also been new schools constructed and new schools scheduled to be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12774)|
| 3:32:59| Likewise, utility improvements have been made as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12779)|
| 3:33:04| As far as request and the way development works, as this body is more than aware, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12784)|
| 3:33:12| that improvements such as road improvements, utility improvements, school construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12792)|
| 3:33:18| it follows density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12798)|
| 3:33:20| It follows the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| It is never proactive or prospective in going into an area and making these improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12802)|
| 3:33:29| based on the expectation of density to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12809)|
| 3:33:34| There's always some form of a catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| We submit that this sector plan amendment is a reasonable amendment going from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12817)|
| 3:33:43| to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| There is rural residential existing in the immediate vicinity as well as there is LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| existing, which is a higher sector plan amendment existing in the near vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12830)|
| 3:33:57| A planned residential rezoning is not necessarily always an increase in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12837)|
| 3:34:03| It just requires certain plan amendments, plan review, and submit that a density of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12843)|
| 3:34:09| up to 1.93 dwelling units per acre is a very, very conservative density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12849)|
| 3:34:17| The applicant, my client, says that the development can still be constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| Obviously, this, as we always discuss on these, this is just a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| This is just a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12866)|
| 3:34:28| This is not an actual subdivision plan or concept plan, development plan approval review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12868)|
| 3:34:34| This is just a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| I want to give the opposition time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12876)|

| 3:35:08| Are you in opposition of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| Jennifer, if you could turn your camera and mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12912)|
| 3:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| Mr. Ryan Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| Mr. Ryan Dabbs, if you could turn your microphone and your camera on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| And are you part of the opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12929)|
| 3:35:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12932)|
| 3:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| I'll let you go first if you just state your name and address for the record, and then we'll go to Jennifer next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12934)|
| 3:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12940)|
| 3:35:41| I'm Dr. Ryan Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12941)|
| 3:35:42| I live at 1811 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| I've lived here for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12946)|
| 3:35:47| and I want to try to explain why I think this proposed development is such a big concern to the community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12947)|
| 3:35:53| And I hope that more than 50 emails that were sent in opposition before the NPC meeting kind of catches your attention a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12953)|
| 3:36:00| The Campbell Station Road is kind of known to be a dangerous road because it's such a windy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12960)|
| 3:36:05| narrow county road with a steep cliffside for a large portion of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| Last year's traffic mobility plan recommended multiple improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| including widening the road, adding shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| and a potential north-south connector road just to bypass this road altogether because it's considered such a difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12977)|
| 3:36:26| road and may not even be improvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12986)|
| 3:36:30| But all these improvements are so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| As you know, the Knox County and Farragut have both requested regional federal funding for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12992)|
| 3:36:37| So even if we receive the funding to do so, it's at best a multi-decade project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=12997)|
| 3:36:42| So we certainly can't count on the road improvements anytime soon to improve the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| And those of us who drive the road daily are seeing car accidents or near misses on almost a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13007)|
| 3:36:54| And so the traffic letter that the developer submitted used 2012 to 2015 data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13014)|
| 3:37:01| but with the traffic count increasing so significantly along Campbell Station Road in the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13021)|
| 3:37:06| these numbers really aren't valid anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13026)|
| 3:37:08| and a new traffic study should be done before a large development is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13028)|
| 3:37:13| So what really makes this particular development different than other higher-density developments in the area is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13033)|
| 3:37:20| specific location of the entrance of this road is at the curve in North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13040)|
| 3:37:25| nearly a 90-degree curve in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13045)|
| 3:37:28| And so even with technically adequate site distances, 120 or more households, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13048)|
| 3:37:36| cars entering the road at this location is just a bad, dangerous idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| Certainly the MPC voted on a max 1.93 density, which allows around 120 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13061)|
| 3:37:48| but really this is still just too many houses and cars entering Campbell Station Road at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13068)|
| 3:37:54| At least that number does take into account the Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan, which is important to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13074)|
| 3:37:59| So I don't think certainly this recommendation should be increased at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| but it's still a really high number at 120 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13083)|
| 3:38:07| which is a really large development for this part of North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| Thank you. I want to give Jennifer a chance to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13092)|
| 3:38:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| Hello. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13101)|
| 3:38:22| Yes. If you could state your name and address for the record, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13102)|
| 3:38:26| Jennifer Stenstrom, 1717 Long Farm Way, here at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13106)|
| 3:38:31| I'm a new resident here, and I spent the past about two months researching all of the county approved reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13111)|
| 3:38:39| and talking to residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| And according to all the stuff I've researched, we are in the rural area of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13121)|
| 3:38:48| and the whole point of the growth policy plan was to prevent urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| And I don't feel like the intent of the growth policy plan is being followed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13133)|
| 3:38:58| to make it even 1.93 units per acre is still too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13138)|
| 3:39:08| For me, that's not rural, and I don't think that's why people have purchased their property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13148)|
| 3:39:14| The character of Hardin Valley and the rural way of Hardin Valley is why people want to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13154)|
| 3:39:20| And 64 acres at 1.93, 120 homes, that's not rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13160)|
| 3:39:28| It's not even close to rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| We're not even in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13170)|
| 3:39:33| So I would really like the commissioners to seriously think about the dangerous precedent that's being set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13173)|
| 3:39:42| making a subdivision on 64 acres of 120 homes, and think about what that's going to do to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13182)|
| 3:39:53| and the hillside and the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13193)|
| 3:39:58| It's going to completely change the character of the entire ridge right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13205)|
| 3:40:10| I believe that was both the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13210)|
| 3:40:12| I'll open it up to discussion and defer to the commission district commissioner first before opening questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13212)|
| 3:40:22| if you'd like to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13222)|
| 3:40:25| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13225)|
| 3:40:30| I don't disagree with anything anyone said on both sides of the aisle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13230)|
| 3:40:36| This is just a part of the growth and development that we are experiencing in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13236)|
| 3:40:46| I do ‑‑ it does pain me, but I really probably do need to go along with the 15-0 recommendation of NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13246)|
| 3:41:03| because of the yet-to-be-voted-on next segment that's coming up with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13263)|
| 3:41:12| in that given everything that folks have said, there has still, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13272)|
| 3:41:19| been much consideration put into what both Dr. Dabbs and Jennifer both have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13279)|
| 3:41:28| And I've spoken, met with Dr. Dabbs, met with Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13288)|
| 3:41:33| It's just been a difficult process all the way around, but in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| I will move to approve the recommendation for the change to rural residential HP, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13298)|
| 3:41:56| There's a motion by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| I do have some additional hands up, but is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| We can continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13323)|
| 3:42:04| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| Commissioner Skinmaker, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| This question is for Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13331)|
| 3:42:14| This project is made up of two separate parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| One of them is owned by Sarah and Robert Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| and it makes up about 35 percent of the total development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13342)|
| 3:42:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| I believe that's roughly, yeah, roughly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13349)|
| 3:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13352)|
| 3:42:33| And we affectionately know that location as Catatoga Kennels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13353)|
| 3:42:42| When will they be ceasing operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13362)|
| 3:42:45| That I can't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| Mr. Harrison may be able to answer that question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13367)|
| 3:42:56| They will be ceasing operations on 12-30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13376)|
| 3:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13382)|
| 3:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13383)|
| 3:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| Thank you, Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13387)|
| 3:43:08| Is there additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13388)|
| 3:43:14| Is there anything either the applicant or opposition would like to say in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| sort of closing statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13398)|
| 3:43:19| Commissioner Durrett, I see your name up or your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13403)|
| 3:43:24| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13406)|
| 3:43:28| I'm looking at our agenda, and it says we are wanting to change the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13408)|
| 3:43:35| plan to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| So is it rural residential or low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13418)|
| 3:43:41| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| It is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| The applicant had requested low-density residential, but staff and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13430)|
| 3:43:54| planning commission committed rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| And the applicant is good with rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13439)|
| 3:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| Which would be the lesser, which Ms. Brooks can confirm would be a lesser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13442)|
| 3:44:07| change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13449)|
| 3:44:12| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13452)|
| 3:44:17| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13457)|
| 3:44:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| Is there a traffic study then that is required as part of that, or does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13460)|
| 3:44:26| that, is that not a part of this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13466)|
| 3:44:30| Mr. Snowden, perhaps you could chime in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13470)|
| 3:44:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13474)|
| 3:44:37| Due to the number of lots being proposed, when Mr. Harrison presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13477)|

| 3:46:55| item for the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| The difference here, obviously the request was for a little over three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13617)|
| 3:47:01| dwelling units per acre, and we are requesting that this commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13621)|

| 3:47:28| and the rezoning requirements that must be met that was previously set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13648)|

| 3:47:47| consistent with the slope analysis and compatible with the surrounding zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13667)|

| 3:48:09| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13689)|
| 3:48:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13690)|
| 3:48:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13691)|
| 3:48:12| So because I have this one chance to mention it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| I feel like I must for all of the residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| There is another lot that is attached to this parcel that is 19 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13699)|
| 3:48:26| If that parcel is sold, will that change the commissioner's feeling on 1.93| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13706)|
| 3:48:32| units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| Because that would be an additional 38 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13713)|
| 3:48:37| which would bring a total of 160 homes to that three-parcel area off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13717)|
| 3:48:43| Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13723)|
| 3:48:44| And they cannot get anywhere else but to Campbell Station Road when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13724)|
| 3:48:48| enter and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13728)|
| 3:48:49| And then also it would set a dangerous precedent because there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13729)|
| 3:48:53| subdivisions all the way from North Campbell Station Road all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| Marietta Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13737)|
| 3:49:00| And I don't know if that's exactly what the county commissioners are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13740)|
| 3:49:05| for, for a rural area of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13745)|
| 3:49:08| And I just wanted to bring that up because it's my only opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13751)|
| 3:49:12| Thank you, Mayor Stenstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13752)|
| 3:49:15| Mr. Sanders, correct me if I'm wrong, but we sort of take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13755)|
| 3:49:19| although we think about the big picture in many contexts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13759)|
| 3:49:23| when it comes to voting on particular land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| we take them individually without, you know, as they're presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13765)|
| 3:49:29| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13769)|
| 3:49:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| You're correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| I don't know that it would be appropriate to speculate about what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13773)|
| 3:49:37| body might do in the future with another application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Is there any commissioner discussion that needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13782)|
| 3:49:45| that everybody would like to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13787)|
| 3:49:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| I would like to point out that in our growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| the rural area does allow development up to two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13797)|
| 3:50:02| And it looks like there's been a compromise between the slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13802)|
| 3:50:08| going by the growth plan and the rural area designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| It looks like this zoning meets all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13813)|
| 3:50:17| If I could add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13817)|
| 3:50:23| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13823)|
| 3:50:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13824)|
| 3:50:26| When this came up, what you said, Commissioner Smith, is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13826)|
| 3:50:34| It, in fact, did not necessarily meet all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13834)|
| 3:50:40| However, the 3.15 on the surface did not appear to be outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13840)|
| 3:50:46| However, the more that it was looked into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13846)|
| 3:50:49| and this is where really the community advocacy kicked in with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13849)|
| 3:50:55| Dabbs and his neighbors stepping forward and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| we've got to have some change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13858)|
| 3:51:01| If this is going to happen, it needs to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13861)|
| 3:51:05| And there were numerous meetings occurred between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13865)|
| 3:51:09| and phone calls between all the parties concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| And a new plan was, in fact, proposed by Mr. Harrison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| dropping it to the 1.93 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=13879)|

| 4:00:37| General commercial probably wasn't appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=14437)|
| 4:00:40| So we looked at changing the sector plan to office, which is a good transition, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=14440)|
| 4:00:45| then going to planned commercial, which we put down some restrictions and allows a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=14445)|
| 4:00:50| more review by the planning commission to allow us to expand and still mitigate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=14450)|

| 4:13:26| If you would, Ms. Brooks, if you would please give us the recommendation first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15206)|
| 4:13:33| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve LDR Lodensy Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15213)|
| 4:13:38| and HP Hillside Protection designation because it is consistent with the adjacent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15218)|
| 4:13:43| by a vote of 12 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15225)|
| 4:13:46| And we'll go to the applicant first, then we'll go to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15226)|
| 4:13:49| So if you would, please tell us about your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15229)|
| 4:13:52| This is a 5.4 acre tract that would probably be in the parental responsibility zone because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15232)|
| 4:14:00| it's right next to a tract of property where they're planning to build an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15240)|
| 4:14:07| MPC approved both the zoning and the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15247)|
| 4:14:13| The CDA also approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15253)|
| 4:14:17| This is an area that is transitioning from agricultural and into a residential, family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15257)|

| 4:14:28| The infrastructure is either already in or planned to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15268)|
| 4:14:35| And it doesn't seem to me that the zoning part of this is what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15275)|
| 4:14:39| It's the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15279)|
| 4:14:42| And I'll have to say that Commissioner Hill has done a very good job at arguing her position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15282)|
| 4:14:48| for the lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15288)|
| 4:14:51| And Ball Homes, we believe her to be a very reasonable person, a reasonable commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15291)|
| 4:14:57| She wants to lower the number of units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15297)|
| 4:15:04| We asked for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15304)|
| 4:15:05| Five was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15305)|
| 4:15:06| I think she wants something substantially less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15306)|
| 4:15:09| And we're going to agree with what Commissioner Hill wants to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15309)|
| 4:15:14| Which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| I think she wants 3.8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15316)|
| 4:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15319)|
| 4:15:20| I just also, Ms. Pettit, I want to explain to you, this is in two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15320)|
| 4:15:24| So we have a first part that is approving the action is to approve the residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15324)|
| 4:15:35| the hillside protection and the overall sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15335)|
| 4:15:41| And then there is another piece after this that is about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15341)|
| 4:15:45| So this is in two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15345)|
| 4:15:46| The first part we're voting on right now is just the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15346)|
| 4:15:49| And then the next part will be about how many is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15349)|
| 4:15:53| So I just wanted to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15353)|
| 4:15:56| So I'll give you an opportunity, if you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15356)|
| 4:16:00| My name is Deborah Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15360)|

| 4:16:09| So would you like me to wait until the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15371)|

| 4:16:14| Is there additional discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15374)|
| 4:16:16| Ms. Brooks, did I already ask you for the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15376)|

| 4:16:30| Ms. Hill, I will pass the baton to you for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15390)|

| 4:20:21| of the land and makes a neighborhood where people are living on top of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15621)|
| 4:20:26| So we are asking you to limit this developer to 3.5, and to be consistent with the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15626)|
| 4:20:33| developments, even though the planning, your staff said it was with five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15633)|
| 4:20:40| It was consistent, but it's not because it's 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15640)|
| 4:20:46| The problem is if you set a precedent at 3.5 or at five, excuse me, then the next people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15646)|
| 4:20:55| who come in, and there is a lot of land on Coward Mill that will be developed by future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15655)|
| 4:21:00| developers probably, and we want to ensure that this 3.5 or less dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15660)|
| 4:21:08| be observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15668)|
| 4:21:09| You know, there have been many changes to our area in the last few years, like many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15669)|
| 4:21:14| parts of the county, but if we let 3.5 go, if we let five go or even get 3.5 and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15674)|
| 4:21:23| that precedent, the next time it's going to be 3.8, then the next precedent is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15683)|
| 4:21:28| to be 4.0, and then it's going to keep going up and we're going to keep fighting for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15688)|
| 4:21:32| every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15692)|
| 4:21:33| So if we can set the precedent for this area with a lot of land around us at 3.5, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15693)|
| 4:21:40| would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15700)|
| 4:21:41| The thing is, is that when builders and developments come in, they come in, they build houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15701)|
| 4:21:51| and they make their money, they leave, and we are left with the aftermath of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15711)|
| 4:21:57| So I've talked to, tonight, I talked to a lot of the people in our area, and they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15717)|
| 4:22:02| to stick with that 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15722)|
| 4:22:05| Our request is just helping us to secure and maintain the surrounding areas and the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15725)|
| 4:22:11| of the surrounding areas, and I would like you to please listen to our voice of the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15731)|
| 4:22:16| homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15736)|
| 4:22:17| And many of these homeowners have been here for way over 40 years, and we've had a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15737)|
| 4:22:23| nice area, and now we have a school that's going in that's going to be 900 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15743)|
| 4:22:27| We have another development, the development to the west is 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15747)|
| 4:22:31| We have another one going down by the veterans home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15751)|
| 4:22:34| So it would be nice just to limit this to 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15754)|
| 4:22:38| I appreciate you listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15758)|
| 4:22:40| Thank you, Ms. Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15760)|
| 4:22:41| Commissioner Hill, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15761)|
| 4:22:43| Would you like to chime in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| It is, and I do agree with everything Ms. Pettit said, and in fact, the last four developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15765)|
| 4:22:51| that have been approved along Coward Mill have been 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15771)|
| 4:22:57| So I was a little bit surprised when Planning Commission approved the 5 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15777)|
| 4:23:05| That said, I talked with Ms. Pettit, also talked with Ryan several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15785)|
| 4:23:14| I do feel like 3.8 is a reasonable, very reasonable compromise, especially given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15794)|
| 4:23:21| fact that this is such a small tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15801)|
| 4:23:25| I mean, I think I looked at it in the end, it's maybe one more house, maybe two, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15805)|
| 4:23:32| I think it'll come out to one more house, which is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15812)|
| 4:23:37| Well, thank you, maybe two, but which is very different when we're looking at a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15817)|
| 4:23:43| tracts that are 20, 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| So in this particular regard, I appreciate both sides being willing to, whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15825)|
| 4:23:57| like it or not, to be able to willing to have some compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15837)|
| 4:24:02| And I do bring the motion forward at 3.8 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15842)|
| 4:24:09| Motion by Commissioner Hill for 3.8 units an acre approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15849)|
| 4:24:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15853)|
| 4:24:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15854)|
| 4:24:15| We can still have more discussion, Ms. Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15855)|
| 4:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15858)|
| 4:24:19| It is on a second, and I see John Schoonmaker has got his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15859)|
| 4:24:23| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15863)|
| 4:24:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15864)|
| 4:24:25| Ms. Pettit, you referenced the tract of land that is west of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15865)|
| 4:24:32| Is that the property that Scott Davis developed at 3.5 dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15872)|
| 4:24:39| And you all negotiated with him for that amount, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15879)|
| 4:24:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15884)|
| 4:24:45| We, he was at first talking about a lot of apartments, and then he changed over to houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15885)|
| 4:24:52| and then he wanted to, it was very, very dense with the houses, and so I remember that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15892)|
| 4:24:58| specifically because we wanted three per acre, because we thought that would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15898)|
| 4:25:04| with the houses that are in this area, the quality of houses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15904)|
| 4:25:09| But I remember you walked back to me and said, 3.5 is going to be the best that you can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15909)|
| 4:25:14| and so we decided to agree with you and go with the 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15914)|
| 4:25:19| And that's what we're, I'm sorry, that's what we're afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15919)|
| 4:25:23| We're afraid that if we go 3.8 today, then in two years or whenever somebody develops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15923)|
| 4:25:31| more of the property on Coward Mill, it's going to be, well, they've already got 3.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15931)|
| 4:25:35| down there on that little one, let's do 4.0, 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15935)|
| 4:25:40| That's what we're afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15940)|
| 4:25:42| And when you're referencing that to the person you're talking about, that was Scott Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15942)|
| 4:25:47| that said 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15949)|
| 4:25:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15950)|
| 4:25:54| Is there any additional comments right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15954)|
| 4:25:57| Ms. Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15957)|
| 4:25:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15959)|
| 4:26:04| Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the, is the Terra Hala extension coming through this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15964)|
| 4:26:09| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15969)|
| 4:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15971)|
| 4:26:12| How does that affect the development of this land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15972)|
| 4:26:16| Do we know, how does that affect the overall number of units being put on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15976)|
| 4:26:23| because of the road also going through this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15983)|
| 4:26:29| Mr. Hickey or Mr. Bynum, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15989)|
| 4:26:33| We've had several conversations with Jim Snowden and I think if you want to talk to Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=15993)|
| 4:26:41| we will work with him in any way we need to if it comes through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16001)|
| 4:26:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16007)|
| 4:26:52| Mr. Snowden, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16012)|
| 4:26:54| Forgive me, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16014)|
| 4:26:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16017)|

| 4:27:02| I actually had a conversation with Russ Oaks at the school system about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16022)|
| 4:27:06| The school system would like to try to gain access to the roadway extension, so it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16026)|
| 4:27:11| that we could move the alignment of the Phase 2 of Tower Mill, or pardon me, Terra Hala| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16031)|
| 4:27:18| slightly to the east to achieve both those things, to provide a little more developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16038)|
| 4:27:24| property for Ryan, as well as allow for better access to the school, so that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16044)|
| 4:27:30| that we'll work with the developer on and hopefully be able to, you know, help him as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16050)|
| 4:27:36| well as the school's concerns as regards to access to the new roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16056)|
| 4:27:48| Sorry for the delay, I was getting a little special delivery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16068)|
| 4:28:00| Any additional discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16080)|
| 4:28:02| All right, there is a motion on the table from Commissioner Hill at 3.8 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16082)|
| 4:28:09| with a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16089)|

| 4:33:12| you can adjourn, the chair himself can adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16392)|
| 4:33:17| But you have to get to the end of the agenda, which is where I think we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16397)|
| 4:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16401)|

| 4:33:33| But I just, while we're here, I just thought I'd get clarification for, at the end of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16413)|
| 4:33:37| meeting, do I need a full roll call vote or can I just get a motion and a second and adjourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16417)|
| 4:33:42| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16422)|
| 4:33:43| If you're going to do an adjournment by way of a motion and a second, then you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16423)|
| 4:33:49| have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=16429)|
