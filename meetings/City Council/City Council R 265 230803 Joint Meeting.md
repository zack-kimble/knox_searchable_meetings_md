|   383.68 |   391.28 | So we want to start by reviewing the Knoxville-Knox County Sequential Intercept Mapping.               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=383.68)             |

|   392.88 |   396.4  | To back up a little bit, I want to explain a little bit about what we call a SIEM, what                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=392.88000000000005) |
|   396.4  |   398.56 | it is, and what the goal is.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=396.40000000000003) |
|   398.56 |   406.64 | So a SIEM is really a community's process to create a picture of what, at any given                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=398.56)             |

|   423.28 |   425.52 | I'm sorry, the criminal justice system.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=423.28000000000003) |
|   425.52 |   433.44 | So at the end of the SIEM, what we should receive is a map and a picture, and it should                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=425.52000000000004) |

|   440.4  |   441.2  | priorities.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=440.40000000000003) |
|   442.4  |   446.8  | So one of the reasons we did this is, of course, you all know Knox County...                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=442.40000000000003) |
|   446.8  |   452.4  | Excuse me, the city of Knoxville had asked us to do that, and the last SIEM that was                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=446.8)              |
|   452.4  |   455.84 | done in our community was back in 2015.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=452.40000000000003) |
|   455.84 |   462.72 | So you can imagine there's a lot of services that have changed since that time into 2022.              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=455.84000000000003) |
|   462.72 |   464.48 | So that's what we wanted to capture.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=462.72)             |
|   465.6  |   471.76 | We thought it was important that we get a third-party entity to actually facilitate                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=465.6)              |
|   471.76 |   472.56 | that process.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=471.76)             |
|   473.12 |   480.56 | So we worked with Policy Research Associates, who was nationally recognized as an entity               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=473.12)             |
|   480.56 |   484.8  | that could come in and really facilitate that process for our community.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=480.56)             |
|   485.44 |   492    | What was great about that is that they had facilitated our SIEM back in 2015.                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=485.44)             |
|   492    |   497.6  | So a lot of the things that they were collecting from our community, they already had.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=492.0)              |
|   497.6  |   502.88 | So we felt like it was a good use and get us off to a really efficient start for the                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=497.6)              |
|   502.88 |   505.12 | process, because they already had a lot of that information.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=502.88)             |
|   506.16 |   512    | The first thing they wanted us to do is create a leadership committee that would guide the             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=506.16)             |

|   580.16 |   584.32 | So it was one of the largest SIEMs I think there has been.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=580.16)             |
|   584.32 |   586.88 | It was much larger than the one in 2015.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=584.3199999999999)  |
|   586.88 |   588.08 | So I'm really proud of that.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=586.88)             |
|   588.08 |   592.32 | It was also during a time, if you will remember, that we weren't sure a lot of people would            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=588.0799999999999)  |
|   592.32 |   594.08 | come out and participate in person.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=592.3199999999999)  |
|   595.36 |   600.96 | So I was very proud of the interest and the investment that everybody had in our community             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=595.36)             |
|   600.96 |   603.76 | to really have a good SIEM completed.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=600.9599999999999)  |
|   605.28 |   606.64 | It was a two-day workshop.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=605.28)             |
|   606.64 |   608.48 | It was April 6th through the 7th.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=606.64)             |
|   609.28 |   614.16 | I'm going to turn it over to Candice to talk a little bit more in detail about what                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=609.28)             |
|   614.16 |   616.16 | that SIEM actually produced.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=614.16)             |
|   616.16 |   617.44 | Thank you, Leanne.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=616.16)             |
|   617.44 |   625.36 | So I'm going to just do a quick overview of the process of the SIEM and really explain                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=617.44)             |
|   625.36 |   629.92 | how the top priorities of change were identified.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=625.36)             |
|   630.56 |   638    | So if you look at this slide, you will see several components, and we're going to refer                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=630.5600000000001)  |
|   638.08 |   639.76 | to those as intercepts.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=638.08)             |
|   640.32 |   647.92 | So at each of these intercepts, an individual who has a behavioral health diagnosis could              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=640.32)             |
|   647.92 |   652.4  | become involved in the criminal justice at any point at these intercepts.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=647.92)             |
|   653.04 |   658.88 | So what the facilitators did is that we addressed each of them individually.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=653.04)             |
|   659.44 |   663.6  | So we would, so start out like with community services.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=659.4399999999999)  |
|   664.4  |   670.32 | We would develop, we would state, everybody in the room would talk about what do we have               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=664.4)              |
|   670.32 |   671.92 | under community services.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=670.32)             |
|   672.72 |   674.88 | And that's called intercept zeros.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=672.72)             |
|   674.88 |   677.76 | Everybody would list what we already have.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=674.88)             |
|   677.76 |   681.76 | And so they would go through that whole continuum and do this process.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=677.76)             |
|   681.76 |   687.2  | At the end of that, what you have is a map of existing services that we already have.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=681.76)             |
|   687.2  |   691.52 | And I'm just going to give brief examples maybe of some of these.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=687.2)              |
|   691.52 |   696.8  | We parked a long time on intercept zero, which is community services, because that's where             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=691.5200000000001)  |
|   696.8  |   704.56 | you're going to find your crisis services, your crisis lines, mobile crisis, co-response,              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=696.8000000000001)  |
|   704.56 |   706.8  | those kind of responses.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=704.5600000000001)  |
|   708.16 |   712.48 | Number two in the law enforcement, of course, that's where you're going to have your 911,              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=708.1600000000001)  |
|   712.48 |   715.28 | your patrol responses, et cetera.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=712.48)             |
|   715.84 |   719.84 | Number three, initial detention, initial court hearings.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=715.8399999999999)  |
|   720.56 |   726.96 | And then in the next one, in jails and courts, you're talking about specialized courts there           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=720.56)             |
|   726.96 |   727.76 | as well.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=726.9599999999999)  |
|   727.76 |   732.56 | You know, we have our recovery court, veterans court, and soon to be mental health court.              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=727.76)             |
|   732.56 |   734    | We're very excited about that.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=732.56)             |
|   734    |   735.84 | That was discussed at the SEM.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=734.0)              |
|   736.72 |   741.28 | Reentry would include both jail and prison reentry programs.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=736.72)             |
|   741.28 |   746.08 | And then, of course, community corrections that involves probation and parole.                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=741.28)             |
|   746.08 |   749.84 | So everybody had input into what we already have.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=746.0799999999999)  |
|   749.84 |   755.84 | And the next step was that we also identified what we thought we should have that we don't             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=749.8399999999999)  |
|   755.84 |   758.32 | have under each of those intercepts.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=755.8399999999999)  |
|   758.32 |   764.56 | And that is when that list, that complete list of what everybody in the room was able                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=758.3199999999999)  |
|   764.56 |   770    | to participate in and contribute to, they were all listed on what everybody thought                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=764.56)             |
|   770    |   771.04 | the gaps were.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=770.0)              |
|   771.04 |   773.52 | The next step was to vote on these gaps.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=771.04)             |
|   773.52 |   776.8  | So you had 60 plus individuals voting.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=773.52)             |
|   776.8  |   781.76 | You could vote for your top priorities, and you could have three votes.                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=776.8)              |
|   781.76 |   786.64 | And you only could put one by, I mean, you couldn't like vote for one priority three                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=781.76)             |
|   786.64 |   787.52 | times.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=786.64)             |
|   787.52 |   793.2  | And so what developed and came out of that was what you see as the top five priorities                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=787.52)             |
|   793.2  |   793.92 | for change.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=793.1999999999999)  |
|   794.4  |   803.36 | And so what they were, number one, this is the most votes, expand case management resources,           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=794.4000000000001)  |

|   838.56 |   841.04 | next one that we had, and they participated.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=838.5600000000001)  |

|   843.92 |   849.92 | So what we received at the end of that process was this document.                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=843.92)             |

|  1034.24 |  1037.68 | probably, at the very least, to explain and talk about.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1034.24)            |
|  1038.32 |  1044    | So I would ask that you kind of sit back and look at it as a large overview.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1038.32)            |
|  1044.56 |  1052.72 | What I hoped to be able to convey is that we have a large continuum that meets gaps                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1044.56)            |
|  1052.72 |  1054.32 | in our service delivery.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1052.72)            |
|  1054.32 |  1059.2  | I'd also say these programs, even though they look very independent, they're not.                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1054.32)            |
|  1059.76 |  1063.76 | They are not sequential in their service delivery.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1059.76)            |
|  1064.64 |  1066.88 | They're also not necessarily parallel.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1064.6399999999999) |
|  1066.88 |  1072.8  | What I would say is that an individual can be involved in a few of those programs at                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1066.8799999999999) |

|  1074.4  |  1077.36 | So it's a complex system, purposefully.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1074.3999999999999) |

|  1223.12 |  1226.88 | I'll first start with the Mobile Crisis Walk-In Center.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1223.12)            |
|  1226.88 |  1231.6  | I think it's important for you all to know that that is a statewide system.                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1226.8799999999999) |

|  1247.44 |  1253.84 | So what I think is very important also to understand is it is a call center.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=1247.44)            |

|  2322.72 |  2327.28 | And we've consulted with two alternative response teams across the country, Kahootz                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2322.7200000000003) |
|  2327.28 |  2330.48 | in Eugene, Oregon, which I'll mention several times.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2327.28)            |
|  2330.48 |  2337.04 | They have been running an alternative response team for the past 30 years or over 30 years.            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2330.48)            |

|  2347.28 |  2350.56 | alternative response, which is one of the reasons we're here today.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2347.28)            |
|  2350.56 |  2351.6  | So we're so excited.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2350.56)            |

|  2354.56 |  2357.2  | So what is alternative response?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2354.56)            |
|  2357.2  |  2363.12 | At its core, it is pairing a medic or an EMT with a behavioral health professional who                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2357.2000000000003) |
|  2363.12 |  2367.52 | are dispatched by 911 as emergency responders.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2363.1200000000003) |
|  2368.4  |  2373.84 | And they have a van that indicates what they are and a van that's outfitted to meet their              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2368.4)             |
|  2373.84 |  2374.32 | needs.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2373.84)            |
|  2374.32 |  2375.76 | So if you want to go to the next slide.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2374.32)            |
|  2376.4  |  2377.68 | So how does this all work?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2376.4)             |
|  2377.68 |  2379.84 | Okay, how does alternative response work?                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2377.68)            |
|  2379.84 |  2382.4  | First step is someone calls 911.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2379.84)            |
|  2382.4  |  2388.08 | And the 911 dispatcher has training to triage that call.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2382.4)             |
|  2388.08 |  2393.12 | And if they identify that this call would be appropriate for the alternative response                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2388.08)            |
|  2393.12 |  2396.16 | team, they dispatch that alternative response team.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2393.12)            |
|  2396.16 |  2399.76 | And the key thing is that team is dispatched without police.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2396.16)            |
|  2399.76 |  2404.08 | So that is one of the main differences from all the other services, you know, we've heard              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2399.7599999999998) |
|  2404.08 |  2404.8  | about today.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2404.08)            |
|  2405.44 |  2407.28 | Now, you do see the police car up there.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2405.44)            |
|  2407.28 |  2408.48 | What is that about?                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2407.2799999999997) |
|  2408.48 |  2412.72 | Just because they're dispatched without police doesn't mean there's not collaboration when             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2408.48)            |
|  2412.72 |  2413.36 | needed.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2412.72)            |
|  2413.36 |  2418.72 | And so the alternative response team can call for backup if they get into a situation and              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2413.3599999999997) |
|  2418.72 |  2420.8  | realize we do need police here.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2418.72)            |
|  2420.8  |  2424.8  | And what we know from other alternative response teams around the country is that they need            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2420.7999999999997) |
|  2424.8  |  2428.32 | police backup less than 1% of the time.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2424.8)             |
|  2428.32 |  2433.52 | So hardly ever, but it is there as an option, which is why this is, you know, in some ways,            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2428.32)            |
|  2433.52 |  2435.04 | it's collaborative, right?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2433.52)            |
|  2435.04 |  2438.32 | But 99% of the time, they're responding without police.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2435.04)            |
|  2438.32 |  2440.24 | So what is it that that team is doing?                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2438.32)            |
|  2440.96 |  2445.68 | First, they can provide things like basic first aid and meet basic needs.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2440.96)            |
|  2445.68 |  2451.36 | They can also do things like provide psychological first aid, crisis intervention, de-escalation.      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2445.6800000000003) |
|  2451.92 |  2458.4  | And what we know from some other teams is that about 74% of the calls, the people are                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2451.92)            |
|  2458.4  |  2460.96 | able to stay safely in the community.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2458.4)             |
|  2460.96 |  2463.76 | But sometimes, you know, people need higher levels of care.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2460.96)            |
|  2463.76 |  2468.56 | So they might be transported to the hospital, to the CSU, to some of the other incredible              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2463.76)            |
|  2468.56 |  2471.04 | services we have in our community.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2468.56)            |
|  2471.04 |  2475.04 | So that is kind of the flow of an alternative response team.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2471.04)            |
|  2475.6  |  2477.52 | Do you want to go to the next slide?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2475.6)             |
|  2477.68 |  2480.4  | So why are we so passionate about this?                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2477.68)            |
|  2480.4  |  2485.28 | Why have we, as a group, spent three years of our lives trying to make this happen in                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2480.4)             |
|  2485.28 |  2486.08 | our city?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2485.28)            |
|  2486.08 |  2487.6  | So we have four main points.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2486.08)            |
|  2487.6  |  2492.72 | The first is alternative response improves outcomes for those in crisis.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2487.6)             |
|  2492.72 |  2500    | So police presence can escalate those in crisis, no matter how well-trained that officer is.           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2492.72)            |
|  2501.6  |  2506.24 | And we also know that people with serious mental health issues are 16 times more likely                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2501.6)             |

|  2510.72 |  2515.68 | Research also shows that CIT training, while super valuable, and we're so glad we have                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2510.7200000000003) |
|  2515.68 |  2520.16 | it in our community, research shows that it doesn't have significant effect when we look               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2515.6800000000003) |
|  2520.16 |  2524    | at outcomes like arrest, use of force, or injury rates.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2520.1600000000003) |
|  2524    |  2529.28 | So when we're able to meet people's needs with a specialized team, like an alternative                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2524.0000000000005) |
|  2529.28 |  2532.48 | response team, we can improve those outcomes.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2529.28)            |
|  2533.36 |  2537.68 | The second point is it saves the city or the county, if they are involved, money.                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2533.36)            |
|  2537.68 |  2544.48 | So CAHOOTS in Eugene, Oregon, saves the city approximately $8.5 million a year.                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2537.68)            |
|  2544.48 |  2551.68 | And I think it's important to note that Eugene is similar in budget and population as Knoxville.       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2544.48)            |
|  2551.68 |  2557.44 | So while programs like alternative response do require an initial financial investment,                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2551.68)            |
|  2557.44 |  2560.24 | they ultimately save millions of dollars.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2557.44)            |
|  2560.24 |  2565.76 | And so, like, just think about what Knoxville could do if we had an additional $8.5 million            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2560.2400000000002) |
|  2565.76 |  2566.64 | a year.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2565.76)            |
|  2566.64 |  2568.08 | That's pretty significant.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2566.6400000000003) |
|  2569.2  |  2573.2  | The next point is that it reduces burden on police officers.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2569.2000000000003) |
|  2573.2  |  2575.68 | So we had a lovely meeting with Chief Noel.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2573.2000000000003) |
|  2575.68 |  2579.36 | Chief Noel is absolutely in support of alternative response.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2575.6800000000003) |
|  2580.08 |  2585.92 | And he told us that there are so many calls that his officers go out to that do not require            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2580.0800000000004) |
|  2585.92 |  2586.88 | them to be there.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2585.92)            |
|  2587.68 |  2591.28 | And so they're having to respond constantly to these calls.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2587.6800000000003) |
|  2591.28 |  2593.6  | We know that police response is expensive.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2591.28)            |
|  2593.6  |  2596.16 | And they're showing up and going, we're not really sure.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2593.6)             |
|  2596.8  |  2598.08 | We don't need to be here.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2596.8)             |
|  2598.08 |  2603.2  | Or this person has mental health needs that are so significant that now we don't, like,                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2598.08)            |
|  2603.2  |  2604.48 | our capacity is outmatched.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2603.2000000000003) |
|  2604.48 |  2606    | This doesn't meet our skill level.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2604.48)            |
|  2607.2  |  2609.84 | And the department ultimately is really stretched thin.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2607.2000000000003) |
|  2609.84 |  2612.08 | They're having to constantly use overtime.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2609.84)            |
|  2612.88 |  2619.36 | Kahoots in Eugene responds to 17% of all the calls that the Eugene Police Department gets.             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2612.88)            |
|  2619.36 |  2624.88 | So imagine how things would change for KPD if they had to respond to 17% fewer calls,                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2619.36)            |
|  2624.88 |  2626.72 | like, what that would do for the department.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2624.88)            |
|  2628.08 |  2633.44 | And then the last point is that alternative response repairs trust with the community.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2628.08)            |
|  2633.44 |  2639.52 | So many people here might have had really wonderful experiences with police.                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2633.44)            |
|  2639.6  |  2644.96 | But I do think we need to be cognizant of the fact that that is not the experience that                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2639.6)             |
|  2644.96 |  2646.48 | many people have.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2644.96)            |

|  2658.08 |  2663.2  | And so for individuals like that, when an officer shows up alongside a behavioral health               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2658.08)            |

|  2672.64 |  2675.76 | they see that mental health professional coming with police.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2672.6400000000003) |
|  2675.76 |  2679.2  | And that is something that is very scary and threatening for them.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2675.76)            |

|  2684.96 |  2689.76 | main gaps of service is looking at how many people aren't even calling 911, right?                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2684.96)            |

|  2696    |  2701.04 | call 911 because they're very scared and often for good reason, unfortunately, of what                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2696.0)             |
|  2701.04 |  2703.2  | will happen if an officer shows up.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2701.04)            |
|  2703.2  |  2706    | So this is the main gap in service, right?                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2703.2)             |
|  2706    |  2712.32 | We do not have a first responder system that responds without police.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2706.0)             |
|  2712.32 |  2717.52 | And that is a huge gap when we're thinking about our folks in our community who are dealing            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2712.32)            |

|  2721.6  |  2726.16 | And so this is why we're so passionate that alternative response could meet that need.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2721.6)             |
|  2726.16 |  2728.24 | If you go to the next slide.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2726.16)            |
|  2729.12 |  2732.08 | So what does an alternative response team respond to?                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2729.12)            |
|  2732.08 |  2733.44 | What kind of calls are there?                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2732.08)            |

|  2743.12 |  2744.64 | types of calls right off the bat.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2743.12)            |

|  2769.76 |  2773.6  | And if that can be safely de-escalated, people can go on their own way, right?                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2769.7599999999998) |

|  2791.52 |  2795.04 | So this is where that EMT or medic really takes the lead, right?                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2791.52)            |
|  2795.6  |  2799.92 | And then we look at social services and community support, doing things like welfare checks            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2795.6)             |

|  2804.48 |  2806.72 | So this is that sort of case management piece.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2804.48)            |
|  2807.36 |  2809.52 | And then the last is general public service.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2807.36)            |

|  2816.72 |  2821.12 | One thing that happened in Denver is they had this pilot program Denver Star going,                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2816.7200000000003) |
|  2821.12 |  2824.4  | and the police officer started going, can we have more of this?                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2821.12)            |
|  2824.4  |  2827.68 | Because, like, we want to call them for backup all the time, right?                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2824.4)             |
|  2827.68 |  2832.24 | So this is, again, this is something that, like, is not, there's no animosity between                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2827.68)            |
|  2832.24 |  2833.28 | any other programs.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2832.24)            |
|  2833.28 |  2837.84 | This is, like, fitting in another service that could help in our community and that                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2833.2799999999997) |
|  2837.84 |  2840.24 | can work collaboratively with our other systems.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2837.8399999999997) |
|  2840.8  |  2841.84 | So we can go to the next.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2840.7999999999997) |
|  2842.48 |  2845.2  | So what is it that we are proposing as Knoxville Heart?                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2842.48)            |
|  2845.2  |  2850.8  | What we would really like to see is assembling a task force with key community stakeholders            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2845.2)             |
|  2850.8  |  2853.52 | to plan an alternative response pilot program.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2850.7999999999997) |
|  2854.48 |  2859.68 | Cookville, actually, has just gone through this planning process, and I believe that                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2854.48)            |
|  2859.68 |  2864.64 | took them, don't quote me on this, but about a year to plan their own alternative response             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2859.68)            |

|  2864.96 |  2869.2  | And so it takes time to bring everyone together and figure out how do we want to make this             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2864.96)            |

|  2870.16 |  2876.4  | So part of what that task force would do is identify a community partner or an organization            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2870.16)            |
|  2876.4  |  2880.24 | with the necessary values and commitment to nonpolice response.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2876.4)             |
|  2880.24 |  2885.36 | So we really need an organization that shows, like, we understand the trauma-informed care,            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2880.2400000000002) |
|  2885.36 |  2891.12 | the harm reduction, and we understand why it is so essential that police not be responding             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2885.36)            |

|  2893.28 |  2897.12 | The next step would be to launch the alternative response pilot program.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2893.28)            |
|  2897.12 |  2899.52 | In Denver, they did a six-month program.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2897.1200000000003) |
|  2899.52 |  2905.68 | During those six months, they responded to 700 calls and called police back up zero times,             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2899.5200000000004) |
|  2905.68 |  2907.04 | hugely successful.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2905.6800000000003) |
|  2907.04 |  2910.96 | Denver then said, we're going to invest several million dollars to expand this team because            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2907.04)            |
|  2910.96 |  2911.92 | we love it so much.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2910.96)            |
|  2912.88 |  2917.52 | Throughout this whole process, we would advocate for transparent data collection and dissemination     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2912.88)            |
|  2917.52 |  2919.12 | to evaluate the program.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2917.52)            |
|  2919.12 |  2924.4  | So many times, programs are started, and then we don't really hear much about them, and                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2919.12)            |
|  2924.4  |  2926.72 | we don't really hear about the data and the outcomes.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2924.4)             |
|  2926.72 |  2931.92 | And that is essential for any pilot program, both for transparency and community trust,                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2926.72)            |
|  2931.92 |  2934.88 | but also to say, like, how do we improve this program?                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2931.92)            |

|  2936.8  |  2942.08 | And throughout this whole process, we value continuous community feedback and emphasizing              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2936.8)             |
|  2942.08 |  2944.16 | voices of people with lived experience.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2942.0800000000004) |

|  2952    |  2954.88 | same as being someone with lived experience.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2952.0000000000005) |
|  2954.88 |  2959.04 | And so, those are the voices we have to center in this entire process.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2954.88)            |

|  2961.84 |  2965.04 | Programs like this are not successful without community buy-in.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=2961.84)            |

|  3721.44 |  3728.72 | And so, whoever we're referring clients, citizens to, we'd have to have an MOU through                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3721.44)            |

|  3732.72 |  3735.76 | So, that's pretty much our role in the process.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3732.7200000000003) |
|  3735.76 |  3741.76 | We took part of the last mental health initiative in Knoxville.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3735.76)            |

|  3745.36 |  3751.68 | But to understand our role, we respond or send out dispatch based on protocols that                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3745.36)            |
|  3751.68 |  3752.96 | are set by the city and the county.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3751.6800000000003) |
|  3752.96 |  3757.68 | So, we can't, anybody, anything that we send out has to be sanctioned by one of those two              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3752.96)            |

|  3758.16 |  3762.56 | And so, we can't freely contract with anybody else to do that.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3758.1600000000003) |

|  3777.04 |  3779.52 | and the city pay us separately for dispatch services.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3777.04)            |
|  3779.52 |  3782.72 | And so, that has to happen on that side of the house for us.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3779.52)            |
|  3782.72 |  3784.88 | But we're more than willing to assist.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3782.72)            |

|  3789.28 |  3791.6  | And I understand the problem on both sides of that.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3789.2799999999997) |

|  3794.56 |  3798.64 | It just has to be a protocol sanctioned by the city or the county for us to participate.               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3794.56)            |

|  3804    |  3808.32 | Now, I know that some of our state partners have another commitment.                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3804.0)             |
|  3808.32 |  3809.6  | They have to leave a little bit early.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3808.3199999999997) |
|  3809.6  |  3812.08 | So, I'm going to have to let them leave.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3809.6)             |
|  3812.08 |  3818.24 | But before they do, I wanted to see if Senator Massey had anything she wanted to add.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3812.08)            |

|  3833.52 |  3840.48 | And I know oftentimes, you know, we are passing and looking at legislation that affects it.            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3833.52)            |
|  3840.48 |  3845.2  | But we're working with our partners in the community and with each of you.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3840.48)            |

|  3857.84 |  3861.04 | But this just is a serious issue.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3857.8399999999997) |

|  3871.76 |  3877.36 | And it was legislators from all over the country coming and looking at these very issues.              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3871.7599999999998) |
|  3877.92 |  3882    | So, it's just something that we all need to continue to work on.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3877.92)            |

|  3889.2  |  3892.24 | And we just need to, it's kind of like a whack-a-mole.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3889.2)             |
|  3892.24 |  3895.28 | You kind of hit it one place and it pops up another.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3892.24)            |
|  3895.28 |  3897.12 | But we just need to keep working on it.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3895.28)            |
|  3897.12 |  3902.96 | And I think working on it collectively is the way to get things done.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3897.12)            |
|  3902.96 |  3906.96 | And I apologize that we're kind of double committed tonight.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=3902.96)            |

|  4196.96 |  4199.36 | So our roots go back that far.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4196.96)            |

|  4206.08 |  4209.2  | and in East Tennessee really started to happen.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4206.08)            |

|  4222.4  |  4225.52 | So the State Department of Mental Health was created.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4222.4)             |
|  4225.52 |  4230.64 | And then later in the same decade, you would see other places start to open,                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4225.5199999999995) |

|  4270    |  4272.96 | But also in the 60s, we started Medicaid.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4270.0)             |
|  4272.96 |  4280.16 | And then that meant we had to educate physicians                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4272.96)            |

|  4281.76 |  4285.28 | And so part of that meant some of those dollars were going to pay for that.                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4281.759999999999)  |

|  4304.08 |  4308.16 | And that leads to the deinstitutionalization movement.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4304.08)            |

|  4363.76 |  4367.52 | that I think you all might be aware of                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4363.76)            |

|  4369.36 |  4372.64 | In 1994, the state started TenCare.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4369.36)            |
|  4372.64 |  4375.92 | TenCare actually is the largest Medicaid expansion ever                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4372.64)            |
|  4376.48 |  4378.32 | in our country.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4376.4800000000005) |
|  4378.32 |  4382.88 | And it was launched in 1994.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4378.320000000001)  |
|  4382.88 |  4384.88 | It invoked managed care principles                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4382.88)            |
|  4384.88 |  4390.88 | and service limits for recipients.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4384.88)            |
|  4390.88 |  4393.52 | But it also enacted some other problems.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4390.88)            |
|  4393.52 |  4395.6  | UT Medical Center and Children's Hospital                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4393.52)            |
|  4395.6  |  4398.64 | both had small psychiatric units.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4395.6)             |
|  4399.44 |  4402.72 | And because they didn't get funded in TenCare,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4399.4400000000005) |
|  4402.72 |  4403.76 | those things closed.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4402.72)            |
|  4404.56 |  4407.92 | Then Baptist Hospital, Blunt Memorial,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4404.56)            |
|  4407.92 |  4409.84 | didn't have TenCare contracts.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4407.92)            |
|  4409.84 |  4414.8  | And Baptist got closed after it merged with St. Mary's.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4409.84)            |
|  4414.8  |  4417.68 | And Blunt Memorial is struggling to this day.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4414.8)             |
|  4417.68 |  4420.96 | And St. Mary's ended up closing its unit.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4417.68)            |
|  4420.96 |  4425.84 | One of the things that Tennessee had was a waived IMD rule.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4420.96)            |
|  4425.84 |  4428.8  | This thing is kind of sexy at the time.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4425.84)            |
|  4428.8  |  4433.76 | Institutes for Mental Disease is the IMD letters of the rule.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4428.8)             |
|  4433.76 |  4439.6  | And what it did not allow was use of federal dollars                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4433.76)            |
|  4439.6  |  4444.08 | to pay for inpatient care at state hospitals.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4439.6)             |
|  4444.08 |  4446.72 | Tennessee, when it negotiated the TenCare waiver,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4444.08)            |
|  4446.72 |  4447.6  | got that waived.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4446.72)            |
|  4448.32 |  4450    | And then what happened afterwards                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4448.32)            |
|  4450    |  4452.4  | was every state in the country would                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4450.0)             |
|  4452.4  |  4455.76 | keep lobbying to get permission for their state to do it.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4452.400000000001)  |
|  4455.76 |  4458    | And eventually, the feds had to say, uh-uh.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4455.76)            |
|  4458    |  4459.28 | We're tapping out.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4458.0)             |
|  4459.28 |  4460.72 | And we can't do it.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4459.280000000001)  |
|  4460.72 |  4466.48 | So they had to turn to Tennessee and rescind that rule.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4460.72)            |
|  4466.48 |  4470.56 | That literally led to the huge disenrollments                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4466.4800000000005) |
|  4470.56 |  4474.8  | in TenCare in the 2000s.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4470.56)            |
|  4474.8  |  4477.36 | So it led to safety enrollment cuts.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4474.8)             |
|  4477.36 |  4479.52 | It would lead to the behavioral health safety net.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4477.360000000001)  |

|  4482.8  |  4484.48 | So another pivotal moment.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4482.8)             |
|  4485.76 |  4488.96 | My colleague to my right talked about law enforcement                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4485.76)            |
|  4488.96 |  4489.92 | interactions.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4488.96)            |
|  4489.92 |  4494.24 | And Knoxville has had an interesting history here.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4489.92)            |
|  4494.24 |  4498.56 | Sometimes those law enforcement interactions have gone well.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4494.24)            |
|  4498.56 |  4500.48 | Sometimes they have not gone well.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4498.56)            |
|  4500.48 |  4502.24 | And we have to acknowledge that.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4500.4800000000005) |
|  4502.24 |  4505.44 | But in the 1990s, law enforcement training                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4502.24)            |
|  4505.44 |  4506.72 | was really kind of skewed.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4505.4400000000005) |
|  4509.04 |  4511.6  | Folks in the recruit school got 12 hours                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4509.04)            |

|  4545.84 |  4549.2  | agreed we needed to reform police training.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4545.84)            |
|  4549.2  |  4551.28 | And so we led a task force.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4549.2)             |

|  4576.08 |  4578.48 | so they could recognize it, so then they could                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4576.08)            |

|  4581.52 |  4583.92 | That is a precursor for all sorts of good things                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4581.5199999999995) |
|  4583.92 |  4586.4  | that would happen later, as you can imagine.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4583.92)            |

|  4590.88 |  4596.24 | It would lead to the chief, Dave Roush there.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4590.88)            |

|  4603.4  |  4606    | de-escalation training moving forward.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4603.4)             |
|  4606    |  4608.96 | And that's a big deal, because every officer                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4606.0)             |

|  4615.44 |  4617.4  | And so it did also lead, eventually,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4615.44)            |

|  4629.84 |  4634.72 | So what we found out after a year of work                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4629.84)            |

|  4642.92 |  4645.24 | and they didn't need to be.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4642.92)            |

|  4714.8  |  4718.2  | And a lot of other states had to go to their legislature                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4714.8)             |

|  4751.08 |  4754.04 | But that's a pivotal moment that I wanted to point out.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4751.08)            |

|  4769.68 |  4773.36 | that was a very traditional form of case management                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4769.68)            |

|  4783.92 |  4785.12 | that they call that.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4783.92)            |
|  4785.12 |  4788.56 | But it's really about linking folks and referring them                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4785.12)            |

|  4827.92 |  4830.32 | Let's just use that money all over again.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4827.92)            |
|  4830.32 |  4834.04 | Well, the state has already done a very good job                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4830.320000000001)  |
|  4834.04 |  4835.48 | reinvesting those dollars.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4834.040000000001)  |
|  4835.48 |  4839.24 | And in fact, every nickel of the Lakeshore money                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4835.4800000000005) |
|  4839.24 |  4840.52 | got reinvested.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4839.240000000001)  |
|  4840.52 |  4842.36 | And what they did was they ensured                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4840.52)            |

|  4846.2  |  4847.32 | would still get care.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4846.200000000001)  |
|  4847.32 |  4849.48 | So they contracted with private hospitals.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4847.320000000001)  |
|  4849.48 |  4851.44 | But then they took the remaining dollars                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4849.4800000000005) |
|  4851.44 |  4853.52 | and they contracted with other providers.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4851.4400000000005) |
|  4853.52 |  4855.36 | And they said, tell us how you could use that                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4853.52)            |
|  4855.36 |  4856.36 | to serve more people.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4855.36)            |
|  4856.36 |  4859.24 | And literally, what the state got out of that deal                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4856.36)            |
|  4859.24 |  4864.28 | was $20.5 million, serving about 12,000 people.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4859.24)            |
|  4864.28 |  4867.32 | That's 2,000 people needing inpatient care and 10,000                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4864.28)            |
|  4867.32 |  4870.8  | more people that weren't getting served back in 2012.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4867.32)            |
|  4870.8  |  4874.52 | So that's really proven to be a strong investment.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4870.799999999999)  |
|  4874.52 |  4879.2  | However, I will tell you today that hospitals are struggling                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4874.5199999999995) |

|  4880.84 |  4882.72 | That is going to be something you'll                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4880.839999999999)  |
|  4882.72 |  4885.24 | hear about over and over and over again.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4882.719999999999)  |
|  4886.2  |  4889.2  | How many beds do we have in the community?                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4886.2)             |

|  4891.4  |  4894.04 | Because you can have 100 beds, but if you're only                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4891.4)             |
|  4894.04 |  4896.16 | staffed at 50, guess what?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4894.04)            |
|  4896.16 |  4898.16 | We're not using those other 50 beds.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4896.16)            |

|  4906.48 |  4908.4  | And they're both off of Middlebrook Pike.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4906.48)            |

|  4913.8  |  4917.52 | They're private and they're for-profit hospitals.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4913.8)             |
|  4917.52 |  4921.56 | They take commercial insurance, and they're doing OK there.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4917.52)            |
|  4921.56 |  4924.52 | They do take some TennCare, and they're losing their shirt.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4921.56)            |
|  4924.52 |  4928.32 | They're losing about $150 a day for every TennCare patient                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4924.52)            |
|  4928.32 |  4929.12 | they serve.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4928.320000000001)  |
|  4929.12 |  4930.92 | So that is a problem.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4929.12)            |
|  4930.92 |  4932.2  | And it's going to be a problem.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4930.92)            |
|  4932.2  |  4933.92 | At some point, they might have to decide,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4932.2)             |
|  4933.92 |  4936.88 | no, we're not doing it anymore.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4933.92)            |
|  4936.88 |  4938.96 | They also don't serve the uninsured.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4936.88)            |
|  4938.96 |  4941.76 | That is something we need.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4938.96)            |
|  4941.76 |  4944.8  | And so we can't be clearer than that.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4941.76)            |

|  4950.92 |  4956.4  | up in Johnson City, or failing any of that democasin bed.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4950.92)            |
|  4956.4  |  4961.28 | The staffed bed problem is an issue at Peninsula.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4956.400000000001)  |
|  4961.28 |  4963.36 | And hence, we don't have access to all the beds                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=4961.280000000001)  |

|  5775.36 |  5777.8  | so you'll see each year the number of people                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5775.360000000001)  |

|  5788.56 |  5793.32 | So in FY13, there were 46,259 people                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5788.56)            |

|  5825.4  |  5828.96 | and I serve as the department's Chief of Staff                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5825.4)             |

|  5892.48 |  5898.44 | And in this last fiscal year that ended June 30th, 2023,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5892.4800000000005) |
|  5898.44 |  5903.24 | there were a total of 2,801 admissions.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5898.4400000000005) |
|  5903.24 |  5906.64 | So as you can see, admissions from the former                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5903.24)            |
|  5906.64 |  5911.96 | Lakeshore Catchment Area, FY11 to today,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5906.639999999999)  |
|  5911.96 |  5916.36 | there's 25% more individuals                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5911.96)            |

|  5920.12 |  5923.68 | than whenever Lakeshore was in operation here.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5920.12)            |
|  5923.68 |  5925.52 | And it's broken down there.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5923.679999999999)  |
|  5925.52 |  5928.12 | That's obviously not our total admissions                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5925.5199999999995) |
|  5928.12 |  5931.48 | on that right-hand side from all of the catchment areas.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5928.12)            |
|  5931.48 |  5935.76 | That is just specific to the 24-county catchment area                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5931.4800000000005) |
|  5935.76 |  5938.48 | that Lakeshore formerly served.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5935.76)            |
|  5938.48 |  5940.24 | Next slide, please.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5938.4800000000005) |
|  5940.24 |  5942.68 | Okay, so if you look at the statewide                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5940.240000000001)  |
|  5942.68 |  5947.6  | psych hospital bed availability, this is very important.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5942.68)            |
|  5947.6  |  5950.16 | Because, you know, we look at what we were at                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5947.6)             |
|  5950.16 |  5952.72 | in this calendar year, 2011.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5950.160000000001)  |
|  5952.72 |  5960.36 | That was 2,509 psychiatric hospital beds in Tennessee.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5952.72)            |
|  5960.36 |  5964.04 | And then 2021, the reason I say 2021 is,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5960.36)            |
|  5964.04 |  5965.32 | we call it the JAR report.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5964.04)            |
|  5965.32 |  5969.56 | It's the Joint Annual Report on Hospitals that's released.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5965.32)            |
|  5969.56 |  5972.36 | And it's going to be about two years in,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5969.5599999999995) |
|  5972.36 |  5974.72 | based on data, that's about two years in arrears.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5972.36)            |
|  5974.72 |  5978    | So the most recent report was released                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5974.719999999999)  |
|  5978    |  5982.8  | by Department of Health and THA in October 2022.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5978.0)             |
|  5982.8  |  5984.12 | So we'll give it a couple of months                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5982.799999999999)  |
|  5984.12 |  5986.2  | and we should have a new report                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5984.12)            |
|  5986.2  |  5988.72 | that'll be based on 2022 data.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5986.2)             |
|  5988.72 |  5997.56 | But that was a 36.23% increase from 2011 to 2021.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5988.72)            |
|  5997.56 |  5999.4  | So there at the end of that note,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5997.56)            |
|  5999.4  |  6003.52 | I want to point out the fact that there's actually                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=5999.400000000001)  |
|  6003.52 |  6008.04 | approximately 700, I'd say 700 or 750,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6003.52)            |
|  6008.04 |  6011    | unstaffed beds in Tennessee.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6008.04)            |
|  6011    |  6014.84 | So that means that the hospital is licensed                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6011.0)             |
|  6014.84 |  6020.28 | to operate 3,418 beds there,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6014.84)            |
|  6020.28 |  6024.24 | but about 700 of those are currently offline                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6020.28)            |
|  6024.24 |  6025.32 | for various reasons.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6024.24)            |
|  6025.32 |  6028.32 | But one of the biggest reasons is,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6025.32)            |
|  6028.32 |  6029.84 | we can't staff all the beds.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6028.32)            |
|  6029.84 |  6032.64 | You can have all the beds that you want,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6029.84)            |
|  6032.64 |  6034.48 | but if you can't staff them,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6032.64)            |
|  6034.48 |  6038.56 | they're not really any good to you for that purpose.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6034.4800000000005) |
|  6038.56 |  6043.12 | All right, so moving to the next slide.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6038.56)            |
|  6043.12 |  6047.08 | Okay, so Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute admissions                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6043.12)            |
|  6047.08 |  6050.08 | from the 24 county area                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6047.08)            |
|  6050.08 |  6053.08 | that was formerly served by Lakeshore.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6050.08)            |
|  6053.08 |  6054.64 | I would have put in the numbers there,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6053.08)            |
|  6054.64 |  6057.64 | but it was going to all run together if I did.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6054.64)            |
|  6057.64 |  6059.88 | So I'll just give you the last two numbers                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6057.64)            |

|  6061.32 |  6065.84 | As you can see, that is the largest,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6061.32)            |

|  6072.84 |  6074.32 | It stayed fairly consistent.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6072.84)            |
|  6074.32 |  6079.36 | In FY22, there were 248 admissions                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6074.320000000001)  |
|  6079.36 |  6083.48 | to Moccasin Bend from Knox County.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6079.360000000001)  |
|  6083.48 |  6086.8  | That number for the last fiscal year for,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6083.4800000000005) |
|  6086.8  |  6092.08 | I guess, FY23 is 242.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6086.8)             |
|  6092.08 |  6096.72 | So from 248 to 242.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6092.080000000001)  |
|  6096.72 |  6098.56 | Next slide, please.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6096.72)            |
|  6098.56 |  6101.92 | All right, so going on to the total number                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6098.56)            |
|  6101.92 |  6104.52 | of individuals who are transported                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6101.92)            |
|  6104.52 |  6109.8  | by the Knox County Sheriff to Moccasin Bend in FY23.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6104.52)            |
|  6109.8  |  6111.6  | As you can see there on the far right,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6109.8)             |
|  6111.6  |  6115.16 | there were 253 individuals                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6111.6)             |
|  6115.16 |  6118.4  | who were transported to Moccasin Bend,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6115.16)            |
|  6118.4  |  6121.84 | and only 11 of those were not admitted.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6118.4)             |
|  6121.84 |  6125.56 | So that's approximately one individual a month,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6121.84)            |
|  6125.56 |  6129.16 | and I'd say less than 5% were not admitted.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6125.56)            |
|  6129.16 |  6130.48 | That's still too many,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6129.16)            |
|  6130.72 |  6133.6  | and we are working to address that.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6130.72)            |
|  6133.6  |  6136.24 | Whenever they have to go down to Moccasin Bend,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6133.6)             |
|  6136.24 |  6140.36 | to Chattanooga, and an individual is not admitted,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6136.240000000001)  |
|  6140.36 |  6142.92 | that obviously takes time and resources.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6140.360000000001)  |
|  6142.92 |  6145.04 | So in order to address that,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6142.92)            |
|  6145.04 |  6147    | what we've tried to do is we've implemented                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6145.040000000001)  |

|  6152.88 |  6154.92 | but that's the reason why we've been able                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6152.88)            |
|  6154.92 |  6159.16 | to get that down to 11 non-admits.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6154.92)            |

|  6792.04 |  6796.08 | I think it's easy to see that there is a lot being done                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6792.04)            |
|  6796.08 |  6799.04 | and there's a lot more being done than has ever been done.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6796.08)            |
|  6800.08 |  6804.44 | But I think it's also true that we need to do a lot more.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6800.08)            |

|  6808.68 |  6811.16 | been reverberating in my spirit the past couple of days,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6808.68)            |
|  6811.16 |  6812.68 | and especially since yesterday                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6811.16)            |
|  6812.68 |  6815.52 | when I was talking with Vice Mayor Roberto.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6812.68)            |
|  6815.64 |  6817.92 | And the two words are unity and urgency.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6815.64)            |
|  6819.24 |  6823.4  | And I'm an optimist, okay, so maybe this is optimistic.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6819.240000000001)  |
|  6823.4  |  6826.64 | But I just really believe that this is an issue                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6823.400000000001)  |
|  6826.64 |  6828.96 | that we can unify.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6826.64)            |
|  6830.28 |  6831.68 | Like the Vice Mayor said,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6830.280000000001)  |

|  6842.76 |  6844.92 | But I think one thing we can agree on                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6842.76)            |
|  6845.32 |  6846.88 | is that this is an issue, this is a problem.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6845.32)            |

|  6863.48 |  6867    | And General Nichols, I think, paved the way for that                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6863.4800000000005) |

|  6889.12 |  6892.48 | And I know staffing's an issue, that's part of the elephant.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=6889.12)            |

|  7010.52 |  7015.52 | and it was helpful to get an update                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7010.52)            |
|  7015.96 |  7019.36 | since our last joint workshop on this topic,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7015.96)            |
|  7019.36 |  7022.76 | which I was not able to join you all last time.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7019.360000000001)  |
|  7022.76 |  7026.88 | I was under the weather, but actively watching at home                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7022.76)            |
|  7026.88 |  7030.88 | and a couple of times after that.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7026.88)            |
|  7030.88 |  7034.32 | And so there were a couple of things                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7030.88)            |
|  7034.32 |  7037.92 | that stood out to me in this presentation,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7034.320000000001)  |
|  7037.92 |  7042.92 | particularly that the number of beds available                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7037.92)            |
|  7043.88 |  7047.12 | in our community have increased,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7043.88)            |
|  7047.12 |  7050.64 | but the number of admissions have decreased.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7047.12)            |
|  7050.64 |  7055.64 | And what came from that presentation is attributing                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7050.64)            |
|  7057.16 |  7058.96 | that decrease to investments                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7057.16)            |

|  7061.84 |  7066.76 | And that is encouraging for me to hear                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7061.84)            |

|  7100.36 |  7104.36 | I believe it's about 40% of those calls                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7100.360000000001)  |

|  7108.36 |  7113.32 | And so that's still a gap that needs to be addressed                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7108.360000000001)  |

|  7145.76 |  7150.76 | like a task force is so that we can actually identify items                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7145.76)            |

|  7210.6  |  7212.2  | One of the things that I'd written down                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7210.6)             |
|  7212.2  |  7213.68 | before we got to the end of it                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7212.2)             |
|  7213.68 |  7218.44 | was expand capacity of services and beds.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7213.679999999999)  |
|  7218.44 |  7221    | And what I took away is that there are beds                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7218.44)            |
|  7221    |  7223.04 | that are out there, there are more beds,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7221.0)             |
|  7223.04 |  7224    | and they're unstaffed.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7223.04)            |
|  7224    |  7228.12 | And so now it begs to ask the question,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7224.0)             |
|  7228.12 |  7230.48 | what can we do to incentivize people                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7228.12)            |

|  7233.32 |  7235.16 | to be able to have those beds staffed?                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7233.32)            |
|  7235.16 |  7237.84 | Because absolutely, we cannot have people in beds                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7235.16)            |

|  7773.58 |  7777.18 | So back to the intercept map that we had,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7773.58)            |

|  7792    |  7794.78 | somehow this has all become about law enforcement,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7792.0)             |
|  7794.78 |  7799.26 | and I'd like to see us at the intercept of zero,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=7794.780000000001)  |

|  8004.3  |  8009.3  | are intercepting into the system.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8004.3)             |
|  8009.34 |  8012.62 | And then somehow we're gonna have to talk to providers                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8009.34)            |
|  8012.62 |  8017.54 | who are serving individuals who can give us the data                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8012.620000000001)  |
|  8017.54 |  8020.78 | on the numbers of individuals who are afraid to call                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8017.540000000001)  |
|  8020.78 |  8023.38 | and would utilize a different service level.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8020.780000000001)  |
|  8023.38 |  8026.74 | Because I think that's something that's hard to capture,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8023.38)            |
|  8026.74 |  8028.14 | but it's very real out there.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8026.74)            |
|  8028.14 |  8030.26 | So I think we've got to talk to the other providers                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8028.14)            |
|  8030.26 |  8032.38 | in the community on how to do that.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8030.26)            |
|  8032.38 |  8034.06 | Would you agree with that?                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8032.38)            |
|  8034.06 |  8035.54 | Yeah, and I would just say,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8034.06)            |
|  8035.54 |  8037.14 | I think we're all in agreement                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8035.54)            |
|  8037.14 |  8039.86 | that alternative response is a need in our community.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8037.14)            |
|  8039.86 |  8041.5  | Maybe I'm overstating that.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8039.86)            |
|  8041.5  |  8043.1  | Maybe I'm hopeful in saying that.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8041.5)             |
|  8043.1  |  8045.3  | But I think there is an urgency here.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8043.1)             |
|  8045.3  |  8048.74 | Like the longer we wait to implement alternative response,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8045.3)             |
|  8048.74 |  8051.94 | the more time we have to have negative outcomes.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8048.74)            |
|  8051.94 |  8054.66 | So I don't, I'm worried that this is going to be                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8051.9400000000005) |
|  8054.66 |  8058.38 | like a very extensive, like slow time of data collection.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8054.660000000001)  |
|  8058.38 |  8060.34 | And should we do this and how do we do this?                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8058.38)            |
|  8060.34 |  8062.42 | And this is why I think a task force                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8060.34)            |
|  8062.42 |  8064.14 | of getting everyone in the room and saying,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8062.42)            |
|  8064.14 |  8066.66 | okay, here are all these community providers.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8064.14)            |
|  8066.66 |  8068.94 | We have so many smaller mental health agencies,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8066.660000000001)  |
|  8068.94 |  8072.74 | like the one I work at that like are not in the room often,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8068.9400000000005) |
|  8072.74 |  8075.54 | but have incredible information and data as well.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8072.740000000001)  |
|  8075.54 |  8078.94 | So like, this is why I hope we can work with some urgency                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8075.540000000001)  |
|  8078.94 |  8083.74 | to say like, let's agree that alternative response is needed                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8078.9400000000005) |
|  8083.74 |  8085.82 | and like, let's take the next step to make it happen                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8083.740000000001)  |
|  8085.82 |  8088.38 | and let's create a timeline to make it happen.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8085.820000000001)  |
|  8088.38 |  8089.7  | I agree with the urgency,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8088.38)            |
|  8089.7  |  8091.62 | but I also see this as we're just,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8089.700000000001)  |
|  8091.62 |  8094.02 | we're beginning some foundational things                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8091.620000000001)  |
|  8094.02 |  8097.26 | that it's going to continue for years and years.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8094.02)            |
|  8097.26 |  8100.06 | 911 started in 68.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8097.26)            |
|  8100.06 |  8103.06 | So, you know, 50 years ago that started,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8100.06)            |
|  8103.06 |  8105.18 | 988 started last year.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8103.06)            |
|  8105.18 |  8106.5  | So it's going to take some time                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8105.18)            |
|  8106.5  |  8108.22 | to build up all of our systems.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8106.500000000001)  |
|  8108.22 |  8110.34 | And I want us to be able to do it correctly                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8108.22)            |
|  8110.34 |  8111.74 | and what the society needs.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8110.34)            |
|  8111.74 |  8113.42 | There are a lot of different crisis models.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8111.740000000001)  |
|  8113.42 |  8116.18 | There are some where after the police officers                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8113.42)            |
|  8116.18 |  8118.06 | have gone to the same place 10 times,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8116.18)            |
|  8118.06 |  8122.74 | then they start sending out crisis response teams.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8118.06)            |
|  8122.74 |  8124.38 | I mean, there are many different ways of doing it.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8122.740000000001)  |
|  8124.38 |  8125.58 | So I guess I want to make sure                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8124.38)            |
|  8125.58 |  8127.26 | that we're doing it community specific                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8125.58)            |
|  8127.26 |  8131.18 | with all of the partners involved with data                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8127.26)            |
|  8131.18 |  8133.34 | and buying into it.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8131.18)            |
|  8133.34 |  8134.3  | So I'm not trying to,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8133.34)            |
|  8134.3  |  8136.74 | I don't want to have another five years of data,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8134.3)             |
|  8136.74 |  8138.54 | but we might need to have a couple of years,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8136.74)            |
|  8138.54 |  8140.58 | maybe a year worth.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8138.54)            |
|  8140.58 |  8142.78 | This meeting is not about making any decisions,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8140.58)            |
|  8142.78 |  8144.54 | but if it were up to me,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8142.78)            |
|  8144.54 |  8146.18 | I would start trying to fund somebody                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8144.54)            |
|  8146.18 |  8148.78 | to do the data collection.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8146.179999999999)  |
|  8148.78 |  8149.62 | Yeah.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8148.78)            |
|  8149.62 |  8150.46 | I was going to add.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8149.62)            |
|  8150.46 |  8152.26 | I'm going to have to interrupt just real quick                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8150.46)            |
|  8152.26 |  8153.7  | because the time has expired,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8152.26)            |
|  8153.7  |  8158.14 | but I do have other folks on the list,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8153.7)             |
|  8158.14 |  8159.3  | but good discussion.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8158.139999999999)  |
|  8159.3  |  8162.62 | So I wanted to let that go for a little bit.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8159.3)             |
|  8162.62 |  8165.02 | The one thing I would add to that                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8162.62)            |
|  8165.02 |  8170.02 | is I think we did hear from Mr. Anders about E911,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8165.02)            |
|  8170.46 |  8172.94 | and he said that they have a lot of data,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8170.46)            |
|  8172.94 |  8175.34 | but they haven't mined that data.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8172.9400000000005) |
|  8175.34 |  8178.7  | And it seems to me like that might be a good starting point                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8175.34)            |
|  8178.7  |  8180.7  | for doing exactly what you were saying.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8178.700000000001)  |
|  8181.74 |  8183.22 | Well, and here he is.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8181.740000000001)  |
|  8186.58 |  8187.42 | Yeah.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8186.580000000001)  |
|  8187.42 |  8188.26 | So real quick on data,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8187.42)            |
|  8188.26 |  8189.86 | that we have a ton of data points,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8188.26)            |
|  8190.86 |  8191.7  | but when you're looking,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8190.860000000001)  |
|  8191.7  |  8193.14 | so if someone calls in and says,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8191.700000000001)  |
|  8193.14 |  8196.38 | hey, there's a person walking down the middle of Gay Street                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8193.14)            |
|  8196.38 |  8199.38 | with no clothes on yelling at people,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8196.38)            |
|  8199.38 |  8200.78 | that could come in as a disturbance                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8199.38)            |
|  8200.78 |  8202.14 | and not a mental disturbance, right?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8200.779999999999)  |
|  8202.14 |  8205.58 | So what we have is raw data.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8202.14)            |
|  8205.58 |  8206.54 | When somebody calls in,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8205.58)            |
|  8206.54 |  8208.66 | it may not be what's really going on                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8206.539999999999)  |
|  8208.66 |  8209.94 | when there's a responder there.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8208.66)            |
|  8209.94 |  8213.18 | And so there's raw data that we can find                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8209.939999999999)  |
|  8213.18 |  8217.5  | that may or may not be sufficient for what you need,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8213.18)            |
|  8217.5  |  8219.7  | but there's also what the outcome                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8217.5)             |
|  8219.7  |  8221.94 | of the response is as well.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8219.699999999999)  |
|  8221.94 |  8225.18 | So it could come in as a party call                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8221.94)            |
|  8225.18 |  8226.7  | and it's a domestic disturbance, right?                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8225.18)            |
|  8226.7  |  8229.1  | So we never get that data.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8226.7)             |
|  8229.1  |  8230.42 | We only know that they made a report.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8229.1)             |
|  8230.42 |  8231.7  | We don't know what that report is.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8230.42)            |
|  8231.7  |  8235.22 | So our data, we can find you some data,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8231.7)             |
|  8235.22 |  8236.74 | but we want to make sure it's pertinent data.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8235.220000000001)  |
|  8236.74 |  8238.34 | We don't know what we're looking for right now,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8236.74)            |
|  8238.34 |  8242.14 | but we're more than willing to look at all of our data.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8238.34)            |
|  8242.14 |  8243.74 | That's public records, especially.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8242.140000000001)  |

|  8327.94 |  8330.42 | that was able to be here and present information to us.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8327.94)            |
|  8330.42 |  8332.22 | I know we've all done that.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8330.420000000002)  |

|  8336.62 |  8338.94 | So I think that's what the big challenge is for me                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8336.62)            |
|  8338.94 |  8341.38 | is that this has been so broad and so much information,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8338.94)            |

|  8344.38 |  8346.14 | There's no way we can cover it all.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8344.380000000001)  |
|  8346.14 |  8349.18 | So that in itself is kind of frustrating too                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8346.140000000001)  |

|  8355.82 |  8356.82 | we would spend all our money                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8355.820000000002)  |

|  8360.9  |  8362.62 | that's not the issue that we have.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8360.900000000001)  |

|  8371.82 |  8374.34 | I think, you know, there's some comments                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8371.82)            |
|  8374.34 |  8375.86 | and we can talk about,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8374.34)            |
|  8375.86 |  8380.74 | we have all these inmates who have mental health illnesses                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8375.86)            |
|  8380.74 |  8382.5  | and they end up in jail                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8380.74)            |
|  8382.5  |  8384.62 | and maybe that's not where they belong.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8382.5)             |
|  8384.62 |  8387.34 | And I think part of the issue that we started with                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8384.62)            |
|  8387.34 |  8390.5  | is how do we avoid that circumstance?                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8387.34)            |
|  8390.5  |  8393.58 | Or how do we avoid the circumstance of a suicide?                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8390.5)             |
|  8393.58 |  8398.58 | Or I've had three incidences in one neighborhood                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8393.58)            |
|  8398.86 |  8402.46 | within just over 24 hours in my district                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8398.86)            |
|  8402.46 |  8405.3  | in the past day-ish plus.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8402.46)            |
|  8405.3  |  8409.06 | One was a drug deal gone wrong and there was a shooting.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8405.3)             |
|  8409.06 |  8413.06 | One was a death on the sidewalk from a drug overdose.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8409.06)            |
|  8413.06 |  8414.38 | And the other, I've been told,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8413.06)            |
|  8414.38 |  8417.1  | I don't know too much about it, is a murder.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8414.38)            |
|  8417.1  |  8419.42 | And I'm not sure, but we could conjecture                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8417.1)             |
|  8419.42 |  8422.18 | that maybe there was some crisis going on there                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8419.42)            |
|  8422.18 |  8423.06 | that led to that.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8422.18)            |
|  8423.46 |  8425.62 | Who knows, maybe a drug deal, I don't know.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8423.46)            |
|  8426.7  |  8428.3  | So there's a lot of needs in our community                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8426.699999999999)  |
|  8428.3  |  8432.06 | and this ties up our police and it ties up our services.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8428.3)             |
|  8432.06 |  8434.22 | People lose their lives, people lose their friends,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8432.06)            |
|  8434.22 |  8435.26 | their family members,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8434.22)            |
|  8435.26 |  8438.54 | and then the community members around them feel endangered.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8435.26)            |
|  8438.54 |  8440.3  | So I think, you know,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8438.539999999999)  |
|  8440.3  |  8442.58 | we've talked about 50,000 problems here tonight                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8440.3)             |
|  8442.58 |  8445.26 | and it's like, how do we talk about something                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8442.58)            |
|  8445.26 |  8446.46 | that we could actually, you know,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8445.26)            |
|  8446.46 |  8449.04 | have an ask about to walk away with?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8446.46)            |
|  8449.04 |  8451.02 | And I think where we started is Council                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8449.039999999999)  |
|  8451.02 |  8452.98 | and how we ended up coming to the table again                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8451.019999999999)  |
|  8453.78 |  8454.62 | with everyone,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8453.779999999999)  |
|  8454.62 |  8457.02 | is we have things that go on in our community                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8454.619999999999)  |
|  8457.02 |  8460.54 | that maybe we could have additional response to                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8457.02)            |
|  8461.86 |  8465.66 | and try to intercept things before the crime                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8461.859999999999)  |
|  8465.66 |  8468.98 | or whatever happened ended them up into the jail.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8465.66)            |
|  8468.98 |  8470.78 | And I don't take away from the fact                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8468.98)            |
|  8470.78 |  8473.58 | that that's really, really a terrible reflection                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8470.779999999999)  |
|  8473.58 |  8475.18 | of our society that we have a bunch of people                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8473.58)            |
|  8475.18 |  8477.74 | with mental illnesses that are in jail                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8475.18)            |
|  8477.74 |  8479.86 | instead of in some kind of care.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8477.74)            |
|  8479.86 |  8481.78 | But how do we maybe intercept some of that                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8479.859999999999)  |
|  8481.78 |  8483.62 | before it gets to that point?                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8481.78)            |
|  8484.78 |  8487.82 | So I think my question to you guys,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8484.78)            |
|  8487.82 |  8489.38 | because I'm going to run out of time here,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8487.820000000002)  |
|  8489.38 |  8491.9  | is we've talked a couple of things                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8489.380000000001)  |

|  8497.1  |  8498.78 | because I feel like that's kind of a service                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8497.1)             |

|  8509.6  |  8512.8  | but yet it never has been able to be that.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8509.6)             |
|  8512.8  |  8514.64 | And it's both people can call in                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8512.800000000001)  |
|  8514.64 |  8517    | as well as providers can ask for it.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8514.640000000001)  |
|  8517    |  8519.48 | So tell me if I'm right or wrong,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8517.0)             |

|  8523.64 |  8528.64 | or expand upon how that might respond to, I don't know,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8523.640000000001)  |

|  8541.64 |  8542.56 | I'm going to try.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8541.64)            |
|  8542.56 |  8543.4  | Okay.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8542.56)            |
|  8543.4  |  8544.24 | I'm going to try to answer that.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8543.4)             |
|  8544.24 |  8545.6  | I don't know where to go in three minutes.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8544.24)            |
|  8545.6  |  8547.12 | Well, okay, I'm going to try to answer that                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8545.6)             |
|  8547.12 |  8549.28 | and I'm going to ask your help on that too.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8547.12)            |
|  8549.28 |  8552.32 | A couple of things came to my mind as you were talking.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8549.28)            |
|  8552.32 |  8554.72 | One is, I think we're talking                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8552.32)            |
|  8554.72 |  8558.56 | about a very broad target population.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8554.72)            |
|  8558.56 |  8563.06 | So it's hard for me to answer what's the best intervention                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8558.56)            |
|  8563.06 |  8567.56 | when we're talking about individuals, I believe,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8563.06)            |
|  8567.56 |  8572.56 | that need food assistance, transportation                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8567.56)            |
|  8572.84 |  8577.84 | to individuals who are having a domestic violent incident                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8572.84)            |
|  8578.4  |  8579.24 | on the side of the road                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8578.4)             |
|  8579.24 |  8581.08 | that might be substance use disorder related,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8579.24)            |
|  8581.08 |  8584.56 | who also might have a mental health situation going on.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8581.08)            |
|  8584.56 |  8589.32 | So all of those interventions in my mind are different.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8584.56)            |
|  8590.28 |  8591.12 | Is that fair?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8590.279999999999)  |
|  8591.12 |  8593.6  | So the intervention I would do on one end                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8591.119999999999)  |
|  8593.6  |  8596.24 | would not be the intervention I would do on the other.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8593.6)             |
|  8596.24 |  8598.04 | And I think what's the challenge here                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8596.24)            |
|  8598.04 |  8601.36 | is how do we know what is happening in real time                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8598.039999999999)  |
|  8601.36 |  8604.52 | and can we really get information                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8601.36)            |
|  8604.52 |  8608.84 | so that we can best send the most appropriate response                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8604.52)            |
|  8608.84 |  8610.68 | to those individuals, right?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8608.84)            |
|  8610.68 |  8613.52 | I think that's what we're all, all of us are trying to do.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8610.68)            |
|  8614.88 |  8615.96 | So I think that's a challenge                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8614.88)            |
|  8615.96 |  8618.44 | and I think that's where the data comes in.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8615.96)            |
|  8618.44 |  8621.88 | I also think that to answer kind of mobile crisis,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8618.44)            |
|  8621.88 |  8623.16 | could we shore up mobile crisis?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8621.88)            |
|  8623.16 |  8625.52 | I do think that there is a lot of ways                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8623.16)            |
|  8625.52 |  8627.52 | that we could talk about shoring that up.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8625.52)            |
|  8627.52 |  8631.64 | Right now, the team is answering 11 counties                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8627.52)            |
|  8631.64 |  8636.64 | and they are doing over 30 calls a day and over,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8631.640000000001)  |
|  8636.68 |  8639.44 | you know, I think the last time I checked was,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8636.68)            |
|  8639.44 |  8640.84 | if you look at all the counties,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8639.44)            |
|  8640.84 |  8645.28 | it's almost close to 20 full psychiatric                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8640.84)            |
|  8645.28 |  8648.16 | inpatient assessments per day.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8645.28)            |
|  8648.16 |  8651.2  | So could they also be a team                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8648.16)            |
|  8651.2  |  8653.56 | that could respond into the community                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8651.2)             |
|  8653.56 |  8654.84 | if it looked a little different,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8653.560000000001)  |

|  8656.92 |  8658.72 | if it was more than one person                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8656.92)            |
|  8658.72 |  8660.52 | or could they go with a different support?                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8658.72)            |
|  8660.52 |  8661.8  | I mean, I think there's,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8660.52)            |
|  8661.8  |  8664    | I don't think there's any reason                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8661.8)             |
|  8664    |  8665.16 | we couldn't look at all the models                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8664.0)             |
|  8665.16 |  8667.52 | and I think that's a good place to start.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8665.16)            |
|  8669.52 |  8671.44 | So, I mean, I think there's a possibility,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8669.52)            |

|  8685.24 |  8686.64 | The thing I was gonna mention in there,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8685.24)            |
|  8686.64 |  8688.24 | that sounds very much so to me,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8686.64)            |
|  8688.24 |  8690.68 | like something we've, you know,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8688.24)            |
|  8690.68 |  8692.64 | we've obviously councils talked about,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8690.68)            |
|  8692.64 |  8695.36 | but then there's been discussion about it this evening,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8692.64)            |
|  8695.36 |  8698.48 | but maybe that's something where, you know,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8695.36)            |
|  8698.48 |  8701.16 | we could ask our state partners for some help                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8698.48)            |
|  8701.16 |  8702.68 | with maybe a pilot program.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8701.16)            |
|  8702.68 |  8705.36 | They could look at something like that                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8702.68)            |
|  8705.36 |  8707.68 | to have a rapid mobile response                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8705.36)            |
|  8707.68 |  8708.8  | for people that are dealing                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8707.68)            |

|  8711.84 |  8713.6  | which would go very much so in line                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8711.84)            |
|  8714.28 |  8715.12 | with what we're talking about                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8714.28)            |

|  8716.56 |  8718.12 | So maybe there is some avenues                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8716.56)            |

|  8723.04 |  8724.48 | but also maybe there's opportunity                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8723.04)            |

|  8939.56 |  8940.72 | that our department's funding                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8939.56)            |
|  8940.72 |  8943.76 | to be school-based behavioral health liaisons.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8940.72)            |
|  8943.76 |  8946.2  | I mean, it's really no different than the adult system.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8943.76)            |
|  8946.2  |  8948.44 | You have to go where people are                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8946.199999999999)  |

|  8950.88 |  8955.28 | And I think for kids, they're in school most of the year.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8950.88)            |
|  8955.28 |  8958.12 | So the more that we can educate teachers                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8955.279999999999)  |

|  8960.16 |  8961.6  | but also give them a resource                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8960.16)            |
|  8961.6  |  8963.56 | so they can focus on teaching                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8961.6)             |
|  8963.64 |  8967.56 | and they can connect that family to a school-based liaison,                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=8963.64)            |

|  9221.92 |  9224.16 | early on, and I feel like it's the same                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9221.92)            |

|  9246.28 |  9247.64 | of that resource in the school.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9246.28)            |
|  9248.08 |  9249.72 | It is a really big deal.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9248.08)            |
|  9249.72 |  9250.76 | I'm actually really encouraged                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9249.72)            |
|  9250.76 |  9253.48 | because we have two bodies left here,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9250.76)            |
|  9253.48 |  9255.44 | and I feel like there's a lot of unity                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9253.48)            |
|  9255.44 |  9257    | around a couple key things.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9255.439999999999)  |
|  9257    |  9260.76 | So as a community, I think we should all be proud around,                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9257.0)             |
|  9260.76 |  9262.84 | I think there's a couple things we can do                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9260.76)            |
|  9262.84 |  9264.12 | to act out of this.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9262.84)            |

|  9266.64 |  9269.16 | and thank you, thank you, thank you.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9266.64)            |
|  9269.16 |  9271.16 | I'm also happy to say I agree with everything                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9269.16)            |
|  9271.16 |  9272.16 | that's been said before me.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9271.16)            |
|  9272.16 |  9275.88 | So I think that speaks to where we're at.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9272.16)            |
|  9275.88 |  9278.24 | I have a question for our friends from the state,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9275.880000000001)  |
|  9278.24 |  9279.6  | Mr. Yancy and Mr. Thornton.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9278.240000000002)  |
|  9279.6  |  9281.52 | I'm more familiar with the local programs                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9279.6)             |
|  9281.52 |  9283.36 | and the new emerging programs and the data,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9281.52)            |
|  9283.36 |  9287.8  | but I do remember last year the gap                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9283.36)            |
|  9287.8  |  9291.16 | in workers for mental health.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9287.800000000001)  |
|  9291.16 |  9293.88 | And I think Mr. Harrington made a compelling case                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9291.160000000002)  |
|  9293.88 |  9297.04 | for how to incentivize that.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9293.880000000001)  |
|  9297.04 |  9300.68 | And I believe the commissioner last year stated                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9297.04)            |
|  9300.68 |  9305.52 | that last year she applied for specific funding                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9300.68)            |
|  9305.56 |  9308.28 | to increase higher education incentives                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9305.560000000001)  |
|  9308.28 |  9309.64 | as outlined by Mr. Harrington.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9308.28)            |
|  9309.64 |  9311.6  | I believe she made that appeal again this year.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9309.640000000001)  |
|  9311.6  |  9313.56 | I just wanted to confirm whether,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9311.6)             |
|  9313.56 |  9316.48 | was that approved as part of this recent budget or not?                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9313.560000000001)  |
|  9319.52 |  9322.76 | So that element of our budget request was not.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9319.52)            |

|  9324    |  9328.04 | was the aforementioned provider rate increase.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9324.0)             |
|  9328.04 |  9332.44 | So I think the approach that the state's looking to take is,                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9328.04)            |

|  9465.24 |  9466.88 | Yes, a couple of questions.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9465.240000000002)  |
|  9466.88 |  9470.12 | We talked about available beds and when we have them,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9466.880000000001)  |
|  9471.08 |  9473.4  | could someone talk a little bit about how we're doing                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9471.08)            |
|  9473.4  |  9478.12 | as far as outreach when we do have available beds,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9473.400000000001)  |
|  9478.12 |  9481    | finding the people who need them                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9478.12)            |
|  9481    |  9482.92 | and getting them into those beds?                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9481.0)             |
|  9486.08 |  9489.36 | Do you mean recipients or who might need them?                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9486.08)            |
|  9489.36 |  9491.44 | I'm mainly talking about homeless people.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9489.36)            |
|  9491.44 |  9494.24 | Like if you have available beds                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9491.44)            |

|  9500.8  |  9503.4  | but when we do have those beds that are open,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9500.800000000001)  |
|  9504.36 |  9507.72 | what is the mechanism for finding people                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9504.36)            |

|  9510.44 |  9512.16 | and getting them in those beds?                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9510.439999999999)  |
|  9512.16 |  9513.16 | That's a great question.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9512.16)            |
|  9513.16 |  9514.32 | I'm gonna answer it a couple of different ways.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9513.16)            |
|  9514.32 |  9515.76 | And Candice, you have not talked,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9514.32)            |
|  9515.76 |  9518.24 | so I want you to feel like you can talk.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9515.76)            |

|  9527.16 |  9529.52 | have to meet criteria for that.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9527.16)            |
|  9529.52 |  9533.88 | They have to have a plan to harm themselves                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9529.519999999999)  |
|  9533.88 |  9537.08 | or someone else, means, intent,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9533.88)            |
|  9537.08 |  9539.44 | all those things kind of have to be in place.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9537.08)            |
|  9539.44 |  9540.92 | So when you think about it that way,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9539.44)            |
|  9540.92 |  9544.8  | it's not sometimes that easy and shouldn't be                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9540.92)            |
|  9544.8  |  9546.08 | to get into that level of care.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9544.8)             |
|  9546.08 |  9546.92 | Would y'all agree?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9546.08)            |
|  9546.92 |  9551.92 | Okay, so an individual can be homeless                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9546.92)            |

|  9557.64 |  9561.8  | And what we know is there's not enough housing                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9557.64)            |

|  9564.28 |  9567.88 | And I think while we have a lot of services                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9564.279999999999)  |

|  9613.8  |  9615.92 | they need more money, right?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9613.8)             |
|  9615.92 |  9619.08 | Like, can you live off $800 disability?                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9615.92)            |
|  9619.08 |  9620.04 | No.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9619.08)            |
|  9620.12 |  9623.52 | So I think like, we don't wanna use hospitals                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9620.12)            |
|  9623.52 |  9626.12 | and needing more hospital beds as a way                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9623.52)            |
|  9626.12 |  9628.48 | to take away from the fact that we need systemic                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9626.12)            |
|  9628.48 |  9630.32 | like increase in services                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9628.480000000001)  |
|  9630.32 |  9633.24 | that's gonna keep people in the community.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9630.320000000002)  |
|  9633.24 |  9635.64 | So I would also just follow up by saying                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9633.240000000002)  |
|  9635.64 |  9639.32 | permanent supportive housing with different levels.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9635.640000000001)  |
|  9639.32 |  9641.56 | So where you have intent, where you can,                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9639.320000000002)  |
|  9641.56 |  9645.2  | for some individuals may need more in-house support                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9641.560000000001)  |
|  9645.2  |  9647.88 | than just maybe just an independent living.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9645.2)             |
|  9647.88 |  9649.4  | So I think there's different levels                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9647.880000000001)  |
|  9649.76 |  9651.56 | that we could look at in Knox County and expand.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9649.76)            |
|  9651.56 |  9654.2  | I think there's probably some shortage in that area.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9651.56)            |
|  9655.52 |  9656.92 | I was gonna add to that.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9655.52)            |
|  9657.92 |  9662.64 | One of the criteria, the legal statutory criteria                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9657.92)            |
|  9662.64 |  9665.24 | for emergency involuntary admission                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9662.64)            |

|  9669.64 |  9674.4  | the criteria is found under Title 33, Chapter 6, Part 4.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9669.64)            |
|  9674.4  |  9678.36 | But one of those would be that there is                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9674.4)             |
|  9678.36 |  9682.48 | no less drastic or less restrictive alternative                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9678.36)            |
|  9682.48 |  9685.92 | that is available and suitable to meet the person's needs                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9682.480000000001)  |
|  9685.92 |  9688.36 | other than inpatient hospitalization.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9685.92)            |
|  9688.36 |  9689.96 | So I made the reference                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9688.36)            |

|  9693.96 |  9698.28 | that this is the end of the road.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9693.960000000001)  |

|  9701.36 |  9702.88 | There are no alternatives.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9701.36)            |
|  9703.96 |  9708.08 | That's where we find the regional mental health institutes                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9703.960000000001)  |
|  9708.08 |  9711.16 | and the emergency involuntary commitment process.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9708.08)            |
|  9713.08 |  9714.92 | Thanks for all your thoughts on that.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9713.08)            |
|  9714.92 |  9716.72 | I knew that wasn't an easy question,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9714.92)            |
|  9716.72 |  9719.64 | and I do realize that there are hurdles legal                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9716.72)            |
|  9719.64 |  9724.64 | and otherwise consensual that you have to take into account.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9719.64)            |
|  9726.52 |  9730.08 | There is a bit of, I think, frustration in the community                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9726.52)            |
|  9730.08 |  9732.08 | where they will see people out on the street                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9730.08)            |

|  9734.52 |  9736.64 | and then they hear that there's beds.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9734.52)            |

|  9742.56 |  9744.76 | and what you're doing with that.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9742.56)            |
|  9744.76 |  9746.6  | One other question I had,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9744.76)            |
|  9746.6  |  9749.24 | Mr. Harrington, you mentioned some things                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9746.599999999999)  |
|  9749.24 |  9752.72 | about a couple of hospitals closing,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9749.24)            |
|  9752.72 |  9754.8  | another one might possibly close,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9752.72)            |

|  9762.24 |  9763.92 | Elaborate on that.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9762.24)            |
|  9763.96 |  9767.16 | Is that sustainable, and what would it take to fix it?                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9763.960000000001)  |
|  9768.24 |  9771.64 | So the first part of your question was hospitals                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9768.24)            |

|  9786.04 |  9789.72 | Baptist Hospital never got 10-care money.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9786.04)            |
|  9789.72 |  9792.76 | So that really was kind of a nail in the coffin                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9789.72)            |
|  9792.76 |  9797.76 | and eventually would lead to their closing units                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9792.76)            |

|  9801.28 |  9805.08 | and then eventually merging with St. Mary's.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9801.28)            |

|  9807.56 |  9811.32 | they take commercial insurance money, private pay,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9807.56)            |
|  9811.32 |  9814.4  | and they take some 10-care patients.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9811.32)            |

|  9818.44 |  9822.84 | that's about a loss of $150 per day.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9818.44)            |
|  9822.84 |  9826.16 | I don't know the answer to how long that is sustainable,                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9822.84)            |
|  9826.16 |  9831.04 | but I will tell you, I have meetings with CEOs                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9826.16)            |
|  9831.04 |  9836.04 | like Mona at McNab and Perinda Catria at Cherokee and stuff.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9831.04)            |
|  9837.16 |  9840.8  | So I hear stuff, and both hospital CEOs                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9837.16)            |
|  9840.8  |  9843.32 | are commiserating over the fact                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9840.800000000001)  |
|  9843.32 |  9847.8  | that their 10-care reimbursement rate is not sufficient.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9843.32)            |
|  9847.84 |  9849.72 | And so that's an issue.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9847.840000000002)  |
|  9851    |  9853.56 | I don't know if they'd ever be open-minded                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9851.000000000002)  |
|  9853.56 |  9857.08 | to receiving funds from the department                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9853.560000000001)  |
|  9857.08 |  9858.84 | for serving the uninsured,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9857.080000000002)  |
|  9858.84 |  9861.84 | but if they were open-minded to that,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9858.840000000002)  |
|  9861.84 |  9864.68 | I think that they'd look squarely back                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9861.840000000002)  |
|  9864.68 |  9867.12 | at what they're getting for 10-care and just say,                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9864.68)            |
|  9867.12 |  9869.04 | it's gotta be sufficient to pay the bills.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9867.12)            |
|  9869.04 |  9872.52 | We can't lose on every one of those patients we see there.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9869.04)            |
|  9872.52 |  9875.88 | And so that's kind of what they're experiencing.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9872.52)            |
|  9875.88 |  9880.24 | They would prefer, I think, to have patients                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9875.880000000001)  |

|  9882.32 |  9884.68 | that's going to be able to make them whole.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9882.320000000002)  |
|  9885.6  |  9887.84 | Yeah, because they're a for-profit business.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9885.6)             |
|  9890    |  9893.56 | Well, I wonder if the expansion of Medicaid                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9890.000000000002)  |
|  9893.56 |  9896.76 | might serve some of those problems.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9893.560000000001)  |

|  9905.04 |  9906.96 | I would tell you that, obviously,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=9905.04)            |

| 10119.8  | 10123.4  | And that is what is motivating me and so many others                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10119.84)           |
| 10123.4  | 10127.1  | to want us to consider and move forward                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10123.36)           |

| 10130.7  | 10131.8  | And so I'd encourage us,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10130.68)           |

| 10135.3  | 10138.5  | let's form a joint work group or a joint task force                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10135.28)           |
| 10138.5  | 10142.3  | so that we can actually have space to review this data.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10138.52)           |
| 10142.3  | 10144.4  | And it will take a long time.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10142.32)           |
| 10144.4  | 10145.8  | I'm gonna go over just a little bit.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10144.36)           |
| 10145.8  | 10147.2  | I just have to say this.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10145.76)           |
| 10147.2  | 10150.4  | What I envisioned is in the first six months,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10147.24)           |
| 10150.4  | 10152.8  | we would go through all of this to figure out                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10150.36)           |
| 10152.8  | 10154.2  | where would this be housed?                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10152.76)           |
| 10154.2  | 10155.6  | Who could respond?                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10154.16)           |
| 10156.7  | 10157.7  | And kind of, you know,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10156.72)           |

| 10161.3  | 10165.6  | And then we would take that and go look for funding                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10161.28)           |
| 10165.6  | 10168.4  | to help fund a planning process                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10165.6)            |
| 10168.4  | 10170.8  | so that we can start to develop those protocols,                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10168.36)           |
| 10170.8  | 10172.5  | those dispatch codes,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10170.800000000001) |
| 10172.5  | 10174.6  | understanding how this new program would work                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10172.480000000001) |
| 10174.6  | 10176.2  | with alternative response.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10174.640000000001) |
| 10176.2  | 10178.8  | So even though the initial proposal                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10176.2)            |

| 10182.1  | 10183.9  | that we need alternative response                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10182.08)           |
| 10183.9  | 10187.3  | and we have individuals in our communities                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10183.880000000001) |
| 10187.3  | 10189.1  | who can help us move this forward.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10187.320000000002) |
| 10189.1  | 10191.2  | Then we begin to map it out.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10189.12)           |
| 10192    | 10193.6  | So this is a long process.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10192.039999999999) |
| 10193.6  | 10196.5  | And I hope that we can make a commitment as a city                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10193.6)            |
| 10196.5  | 10199    | and potentially also as a county                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10196.52)           |

| 10361.9  | 10364    | You know, I think what we've heard is that                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10361.880000000001) |

| 10367.2  | 10369.7  | is not unique to Knoxville.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10367.24)           |
| 10369.7  | 10373    | But I think what is unique is that we have                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230803-joint-meeting?start=10369.68)           |
