| 0:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Mr. Creel, if you could start by stating your name and address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| I'd like to ask everyone here to support the petition we did and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| rename this park to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| I'm the president of Historic Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| My name is Pete Creel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I live at 509 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| I've lived in Old North Knoxville for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| I met Beth somewhere around 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| and she immediately became a diligent worker in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| She supported the cleaning of the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| always made sure that we had dumpsters to clean our neighborhood when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| got ready for our home tour and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| And she took on the chairperson of our park once we got it started and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| became the beautification chairperson for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| She worked diligently, although she fought three rounds of cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| never gave up, made it a beautiful place for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| a place where we can come and feel comfortable whether you're a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| or whether you're an adult, was instrumental in us having a gazebo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| and playstations for the children to be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| She also diligently worked in planting flowers, weeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| kept the garden spaces there in our park clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| as well as the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| She, along with David, worked hard to establish this park for us to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| and I think it's only appropriate that her name be on that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Did you have anything else you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| I just wanted to make a brief statement for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Lauren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I'm not really going to speak because I can't keep it together every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| So I just want to acknowledge Lauren Booker and David for being here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and it's an honor to do this, to remember all that Beth did for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Sorry, I really can't hold it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| I think the thing that people need to know is that Beth did all this very selflessly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| and she wanted things to be there knowing that she wouldn't always be there with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| And she's created a beautiful park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| and she organized a lot of events in that park for children to have egg hunts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I just wanted to also acknowledge that our neighbor Jesse Ursary is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| and someone asked me how the park got its name in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| These were abandoned lots that neighbors cleaned up and organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| and worked with the city to make into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Anyway, I believe Beth and David had a competition in our newsletter to name the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| and Jesse told me tonight that I chided him for giving it such a simple name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| of Old North Knoxville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| So obviously it was a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| So anyway, Jesse is totally fine with us swapping the name out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| and is here to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| And if you want to know more about Beth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I think Lauren and David do a lot better of talking about her than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| And the only other thing I wanted to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| I can't remember if Pete just said, is we did do a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| because I didn't want it to appear that I was asking for this on my own without support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and we had, I believe, 200-and-something signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Some were close to 300, and the majority were not in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| Beth had a lot of people that she touched throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| and the work that she did with the cancer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| She was a nutritionist at Fort Sanders and took care of a lot of people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| and she was very involved, I believe, at her church, the Unitarian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| So she was constantly a role model for people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| and the kids in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Appreciate having her in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Yes, I can't add much to what Councilperson Ryder said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| I knew Beth mainly from the creek cleanups over in First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| and just the hands-on nature of some of her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I know that was just a fraction for what she did over there in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| but I saw her with waders and gloves, and she would get down in the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| and pull out all kinds of trash and lots of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| and she would do that at least once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| and that was a regularly organized event she had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and it made a big difference on that area down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And so this is, just for that alone, not including all the other things that she did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| this is very well deserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and I look forward to enjoying her work that she did on the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| and also that park for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| I'll just add I was friends with Beth and known her many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and this is a very fitting tribute to someone who cared so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| and did so much for Old North Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| She's an amazing gardener, baker, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and a real inspiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| and I think she played a role in helping name other parts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| for other people who did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So this is just a very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| She'd be pleased that this was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| And so to Lauren and David, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| David, thank you for your beautiful haikus that you share in her memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1420)|

| 0:23:47| and we're so glad that this part can be one way to remember Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1427)|

| 0:28:01| I believe the original contract is from 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| so what's the plan from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| This will take us for about a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1686)|

| 0:28:10| Cheryl Ely, Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| So the plan is to extend it for a year to allow us to really look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| agreement that we have in place also to get all documents together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| to go out to bid for that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| to see if that is a management team that we want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| to go forward with going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| And I spoke to you earlier today, and you talked about doing a golf study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Kind of tell me what would that entail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| and what all would we be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| The golf study really focuses on the finances of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| It looks at the capital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| It also looks at the market analysis, looking at other golf courses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| We hope that it will also tell us what we would be wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| in a new management firm if that is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| And will we also, in that study, look at use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Yes, that will be part of that study, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And revenue streams and how that all balances out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| Whittlesprings Golf Course is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| and I've gotten a lot of concerns from neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| and you and I have had meetings with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| So I would just like to have a moment to touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| There are a lot of folks that live along the edge of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| The houses came after the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| But there's a lot of damage, property damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| from the resurgence of golf popularity during COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and the increase of apparently some not-so-good golfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| able to take a ball really far and slice it over the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| And so can you talk about how we've responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| to try and mitigate some of those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| So we hired a consultant to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| and look at the golf course as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| but also those two holes that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| I think it's holes 10 and 11 that run along Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| And in doing that, they came up with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| where a couple of mitigation factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| such as changing the direction of the tees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| enlarging a couple of tees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| adding another like there's usually three tiers of holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| or tees on a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| They did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Also putting in some fast-growing trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| that could basically help catch some of those balls from going over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| But that was the biggest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| And we did those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| We looked at the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| It came in, I guess, early January of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| And we planted trees and did all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| by February and March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| So the trees that got planted there are now like six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| or eight-ish months old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| They should be, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Six to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| And I'm sure we'll have lots more conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| as you work towards the next contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Council Member Singh, you got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1864)|

| 0:31:09| 11H is a resolution authorized by the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1869)|

| 0:31:19| at seven city locations for an amount not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1879)|

| 0:31:30| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Yes, if Director Ely could join us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| Our packet states that there are many playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| in our city in need of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| and some in need of complete replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I wanted to get a better understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| and I've asked this before with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| but in how the city selects which playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| to provide upgrades for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Cheryl Ely, Director of Parks and Recreation again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| What we've done is we've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| and looked at the age and the deterioration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| of a lot of those play structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| and so that was how we were able to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| and rank which ones needed to go at what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| So we were able to look at it from that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| So there are a lot of play structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| We have 68 across the city, and we've made a dent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| but we still have a lot to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| But normally it is the safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| that are associated with it, the age of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| as well as how fast it is deteriorating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| under the normal environmental conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And do you have a sense, is there a timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| for how the city plans to address those 68 structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| We put in every year, we put in an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| to at least do at least five or six per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| because it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| I'm not sure if you realize that playgrounds right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| if we can get a playground for less than $70,000 to $80,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| we're doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| But that's really what we look at is sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| it's the allocation that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| and we kind of try to spread that out as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| with the structures that we're allotting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| In terms of those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| it states that ARPA funds will be prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| for this work, but there are also other sources of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Do we know how much in ARPA funds would go towards this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| and how much have been budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Off the top of my head, I do not know how much we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| We were allocated about $740,000, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| for this upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| which I think is part of that ARPA funding that came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| but I may not speak to that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Mr. Brace, do you have more detail on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| No, but we can email that out to members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| the exact amount that was allocated out of ARPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| versus our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| I appreciate your explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and feel better about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| for the playgrounds to be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I would like to know a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| but my major concern is the lack of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| around the use of ARPA funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| and how $700,000 in ARPA funds were deemed a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| for these playground upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| especially with what we have on our agenda coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| $2 million for KPD, for crime intervention programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| just to see no money allocated towards community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| for violence intervention through the ARPA funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| concerns me, it disappoints me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and the lack of any sort of public discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| around how those funds should be prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I think it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I don't know if this is what the community would lift up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| as the highest priority for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| So for that reason, I'm not able to support this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| and I have questions about the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| but I'll hold off until we get to that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I just want to say that we have had lots of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| on all our budget decisions and priorities, including ARPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| And most of them happened right here in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| with the full discussion of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| And I appreciate that they represent the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| as elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| So Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Council has represented the community in those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| or we've had that discussion with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I don't remember those meetings at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| The only ones I know of are around 4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| But last year when we had 20 million come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| I raised my concerns that we didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| any sort of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| We had a discussion and said there would be time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| for the next allocation to have that public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| It never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| We never had any input from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| on those 40 million in ARPA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| So if there was a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| please let me know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| But in my memory, there's been no public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| I'll move on to Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| Ms. Ely, I know the North Hills Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| which is one of the structures listed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| had some damages, some dangerous elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| like things sticking out that would cut or tear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Have those been removed temporarily while we're waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| I wasn't sure where that ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| The entire structure was removed once we got notified of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and realized that we could not structurally repair that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and that we were going to order a new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| So there is not a play structure there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| So there's no playground equipment in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Was the neighborhood provided options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| to look at what the new incoming structure might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| We provided them with options, had some conversations with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| looked at the tree lines and things around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| So, yes, they did and provided feedback on what they thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| the selection that they wanted to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| To replace that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| And I just asked about that one specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| because that's the one where community copied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| and reached out to me on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| so I can't speak to some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Of all of these structures, do you know which ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| how old the oldest were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I don't care which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| I'm just curious what the oldest...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Off the top of my head, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| I can tell you that some of them have been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| for at least 30 years, which ones I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| but we do have some that are still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| We have some that old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| 11-I as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| with Great Southern Recreation, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| for design, provision, and installation of play structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| and related improvements at Baker Creek Preserve Adventure Playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| for an amount not to exceed $640,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| So this has a similar introduction as our last agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| where it states the city's playgrounds are in need of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| or a complete replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| I'm not sure why the Baker Creek project was pulled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| and not included with the last agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| Any clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Yeah, it's part of our urban wilderness development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| which is part of a bigger project, not just one playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| I'm generally in support of the redevelopment that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2375)|
| 0:39:45| in areas that need the infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I'm questioning why we have how this would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2389)|
| 0:40:00| if we applied an equity analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| And I don't think it would look very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| It's hard for me to crunch the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| and determine with how it's presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| but it feels like we're investing disproportionately in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| over the other year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Just to follow up on that, Director Brace, these are not new funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| These are part of the phased funds allocated for the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Baker Creek plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| So Baker Creek was phased out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| and so this is that next phase of Baker Creek that was funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| and approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| This is just phase two of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| These are not new dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| This is just allocation to the vendor being selected for the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Council, you might also find it interesting the UT Baker Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| just came out with a study with the positive impacts of the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| and you can look up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It's got some good information about the benefits of these investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I'm trying to get the attachment open here, and it hasn't quite opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| so could I get some clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| This is for more than just structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Does this include, like, grading work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Brace or Ms. Montgomery would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| Excuse me, Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Wait, RJJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| I'm going back to your original name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| From me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| RJ Justice, City of Knoxville Economic Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| And, yes, this playground and the amount for it is for structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| and grading and site-specific work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| It will be a design-build project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| so you know the unique features of the site there is very hilly and rocky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| so we'll be incorporating this into the hillside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| So this particular agenda item is a higher dollar figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| because it's not just a place structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| The previous agenda item where it's a lower dollar amount per park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| is not for grading work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| It's just to replace a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Most of the playgrounds, and correct me if I'm wrong, Cheryl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| but most of the playgrounds in the previous item are replacements of partial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| structures or all structures, and they're on flat surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| The Baker Creek Playground is also from a different funding source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| and it's very site-specific in its design-build approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| So, yes, that's why the costs are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Okay, and in proximity to the middle schools there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| South Doyle Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| South Doyle Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Where is the structure located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Because my attachment is still not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| So South Doyle Middle School is off Decatur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| so Tilson leads over to Taylor, and where Severe Heights Church is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| it's between the church and the bike park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Oh, okay, because there's no play structures on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| It's relatively close to where the original adventure playground was at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| I don't remember where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Is the kids' pump track and then the big adult pump tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Where is it in relation to those two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Closer to the church's parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| All right, but on the city's land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2613)|

| 0:43:44| Before we go on, Mr. Johnson asked on Item H, Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| he wanted to confirm your vote on that item on the playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2631)|

| 0:44:49| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| I have multiple concerns about this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| One concern that I had is before coming to this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| I had community members who were being contacted by the media about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| this grant being asked questions, and they had no information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| this grant or this work because the city has pulled something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| together that they're moving forward with without community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| I was at an event recently with Thomas Act at the Baker Center on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| I myself paid $13 to park so I could get into the event quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| something I've never done, I will tell you that, around the UT area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| But it was an important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| I wanted to make sure I was there, and I wanted to make sure I was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| As I was approaching the event past the community member who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| looking for parking, I had nothing to tell her because it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| difficult space to navigate, especially trying to come to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| evening event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| So when it was announced at that event that that was our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| meeting, I was shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| When it was announced at that event that that was the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| meeting where we discussed the data from Thomas Act, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| December there would be a meeting to develop a plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| Now, this is all happening without the no meetings in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| Knoxville, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| No meetings with those most directly affected on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2813)|
| 0:47:03| And no discussion of what the community's experience has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| not only while experiencing an increase in gun violence, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| their experience with increased policing in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| What has that experience been like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| What about when we have a police department that is going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| so much turmoil in leadership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| What is the trust level like with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| Does it even matter to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| I've had discussions with members of the administration who feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| that hiring a new police chief is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| And I worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I push back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| And I say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| But also there are questions yet to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| I've heard interviews with the chief where he talks about putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| in place task forces that will help end the violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| But he comes from a department in New Orleans where task forces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| were disbanded because of how they were policing, because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| disproportionate number of black residents who were being stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| and searched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| And these are conversations we haven't had in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| We don't have a federal consent decree over us that requires the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| data to be produced regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| But what we do have is the ability to talk to people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| and hear what their experience is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| And what I'm hearing are, are they constitutional stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| But is it a disproportionate number of especially black males who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| being pulled over in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Is there a lack of trust in the community for our current police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| And it's a conversation that we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| What we have before us is a grant application that proposes 2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| Now remember what we have, 1.5 million in the last agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Now we got 2 million going to KPD to work with the community when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| haven't even seen, asked the community if they want to work with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| We're putting the cart before the horse and we're ignoring the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| and voices of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=2998)|

| 0:50:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3005)|

| 0:50:10| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| International Database Corporation, DBA, BIDNET, to provide the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| with a cloud-based contract management system for a total cost over five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| years not to exceed $265,974.18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Yeah, I just was going to ask, like, how are we managing the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Ms. Owens, if you could come up and share an overview of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3045)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| I'm Penny Owens, purchasing agent for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| The way we do that right now is very manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| So we have a spreadsheet that we use to track the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| The law department also has their own database that they track the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| contracts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| After you all approve the contracts, we send those out via paper for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| signature, and then they come back in, and we route them internally for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| signature, and that's also all hand-carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| So it's pretty difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| The front-end piece right now is electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| We currently do have a vendor registration system, and we do online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| So this new system would encompass all of that and put that into one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| And I left Will out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| The recorder's office also has another database of all the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| So this would give us one central repository, so we have everything in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| We can route everything electronically for signatures, for approval, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| hopefully we will also have the electronic signatures on the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| So I guess my question is, the recorder's office has always been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| repository for all the signed, finalized contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Is it all going to be digital now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| How is that going to – what's the process change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| Yeah, we intend to include that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| So it would be electronic through that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| And then all the same parties that access everything now, internal staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| will still have access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Like the recorder's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Yeah, right now, really internally, nobody has transparent access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| that because it is so manual, and we have three different databases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3169)|

| 0:54:45| Mr. Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Greg, please come to the podium, state your name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Greg Ducey, 206 Hinton Avenue in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| I had a number of things I wanted to talk about on my agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| but I added one because I felt moved almost to the point of the emotions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| that Councilwoman Ryder showed in a number of you who came up to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| noticing that I'm back and I've been gone for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| And that's kind of heavy on my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| And usually I'm out serving others or very seldomly taking care of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| which I did over the last five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I shared with a few folks up here, particularly Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| about the tragic, horrific loss of life of my friend, Janet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| who was kind of the impetus behind my interest in rehabbing the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| black cemeteries on Richmond Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| So I kind of went into a place of taking care of myself, and I've been gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| It's good to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I don't need a lot of attention, but the smiles that Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and a number of you shared with me added a lot to my healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| The last time I saw you, Mayor, was at the 4th of July celebration downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| I meant to come back and say a lot of good things, but that's been five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| And also we have a new chief since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| and I've had a pretty good relationship with the prior chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| and, Chief, I want to welcome you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Along that line, I interact with the police quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Occasionally I get pulled over for a burned-out taillight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| but most of the time I'm pretty proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| And I guess why I'm here is to not debate the good and bad of police so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| in any community, but challenge all of us to catch people being good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| as a teacher once told me, instead of catching people being bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| And that can relate to being a parent, a teacher, or a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| And I don't have a lot of names to share, but I can say I try to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| and talk to every officer I see, and I thank them for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| And I cannot tell you how much it means to them, seeing it in their face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| One way, maybe a baby-step way, that community members can get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| with their police force is, this Friday in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| they're going to have coffee with the cops at the Golden Arches over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| off of Chapman Highway in Councilperson Smith's district, right over the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| It's 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I'm going to be there because I live in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| and I hope some of you come over and meet the officers that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| I want to give a shout-out particularly to Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| who reached out to me during the time of loss of my good friend Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| And more recently, thank you, Ms. Seema, for referring the Boy Scouts to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| I got a call from a young high school Boy Scout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and he and his crew want to come over and help with the cemeteries on Richmond Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| So this is a good time when the leaves are down, when it's cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| And without you and your support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and being that it's in your district, this wouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| I mentioned the loss of my friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| and one of the things I did is I stayed busy during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| And for the third session now, I've been working as a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| So I want to encourage the community, particularly our retired community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| which it's easier to do, to work in the voting polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| I saw a lot of the city's public service folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I saw police officers there, fire there, engineering people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| and a lot of former police officers, former city council members over at Expo Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| I can't tell you what a rewarding experience that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| to serve as a volunteer official in our voting, whether it be city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| And lastly, I want to invite everyone, as I've done for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| every Wednesday now for nearly 24 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| including the blizzard of 94, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| I worked down at the lost sheep ministry with the homeless community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| We start at 630 Sharp tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Every Wednesday night, it's down on Ayler Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| and I hope a few of you come, council folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| and other people can show up in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221115?start=3588)|
