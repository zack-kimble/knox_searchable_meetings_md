| 0:02:37| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=157)|

| 0:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Any questions, corrections, additions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Then items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| I'd like to move the withdrawal of 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| And if we get a second, I've got a comment to make on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| This is the issue dealing with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| And I went ahead, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| and found my copy of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| which we've worked hard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| And right here in the cover it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| the Knoxville and Knox County 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| And I, for one, just want to go on record as saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I'm really sick of only one of those two partners doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| And I hope something changes on that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| The motion is to withdraw 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| All those in, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Your comments aren't specifically for this item, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Well, in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| A cause of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| It's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| we're withdrawing this because the county refuses to take its responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| I mean, we're withdrawing this because of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| our willingness to help the county work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| And the county is not even willing to do anything then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| So, yes, it does have to do with why this is being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| All those in favor of withdrawing 11K, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Anything else to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| I would like to postpone item 12A for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| It is co-sponsored by Councilman Woodhull and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Councilman Woodhull is ill with the flu this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| And out of respect for him, I'd like to postpone discussion of this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Moved and seconded to postpone 12A for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| And I apologize to anyone who might have come down tonight to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| I did when I heard from Councilman Woodhull shortly after lunch this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I did contact Stephanie Brewer-Cook with Cody so that she could let that constituency know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| because I know they were very interested in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| And I also let Michelle Hummel know at the CBID there was a constituency there that was interested in this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So, hopefully, some of the word got out this afternoon that Councilman Woodhull was sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| and he very much wanted to be here for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Well, I don't really have an objection to the postponement, except for the reasons that you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| Because I've had a number of e-mails regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| and it would have been really helpful for me today when I was responding to the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| to have known that the plans were to withdraw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| because then that would have been an opportunity to indicate to those who were interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| that it was not going to be heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And I was not in a position to do that, so I feel quite disappointed that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| I mean, you know, I just think it's hard to get the word out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| and I think it's so difficult to get here for these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| so I have a little problem with postponing at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Mayor Haslund, may I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| I'm always very cognizant of the restrictions that we have under the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| and I did when I got an e-mail from Councilman Woodhull that he was sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| before I even replied to him to ask him as co-sponsor if he'd like to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| I called Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| He can verify that, and he reminded me that in items of scheduling, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| we're allowed to communicate with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| but I was so afraid of getting into a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| a deliberative discussion about the merits or not of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| that I e-mailed Councilman Woodhull back and let him know I was glad to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| propose a postponement tonight on his behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| and tried to contact as many constituent groups as I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| but I did not contact any other council members out of concern of following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| So I apologize if that inconvenienced anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Well, I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed that we're not going to hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| because I was threatened over this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| and I certainly wanted to vent over that threat that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| You have to hold that vent for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Can you hold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| It's postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And then the consent items are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| We actually don't have any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| A couple of three things real quick on the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| You know, the city and the Knox County Public Library have been sponsoring the Brown Bag Green Book Series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| which has been a great success and large attendance at all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Tomorrow is Dr. Jim McIntyre, our school superintendent, leading a discussion of the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=494)|

| 0:09:25| That's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| I know you all have been a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| A couple of other things just to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Some of you all actually didn't get a chance to get there, but Saturday was a free day at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| This is an astounding number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| 25,000 people came to the zoo on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| It's a gorgeous day, obviously, and the free attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Obviously, it's a great product, too, at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| You all have all helped us keep it that way, so I wanted to note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| When 25,000 people show up on a Saturday, that's an amazing feat, so I wanted you all to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| And that's it for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I want to go over two upcoming council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| First, let me say we had our first orientation for new council members yesterday, quite successful in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| I want to thank the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Director Martin set this up, had a whole raft of administration officials coming in to meet the new folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| I think things went well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Two weeks from yesterday, on November 30th, we're having what we're calling the sharing workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| which will be over in the small assembly room here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| It's an event where what we hope happens is all the wisdom that the people that are leaving council have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| will be shared with the new people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| That will be 5 o'clock on November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| And then another workshop a little further out, December 10th, will be a workshop on the new city recycling program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=648)|
| 0:10:58| And I think that will be in this room, and that's on a regular workshop night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Councilman Hultman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Councilman Becker, how long is the sharing workshop going to last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=665)|

| 0:11:11| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=671)|

| 0:11:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| How long do you expect that to last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| I think knowing how this council could take 45 minutes to discuss apple pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| I will just second Mr. Booker and his under the breath comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| I think it will be an hour and a half will probably be the planned time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| To share all the wisdom we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| What are we going to do with the rest of the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=696)|

| 0:17:25| We do have several folks signed up to speak tonight to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Mr. Seymour, will you speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| I'm here with Bud Cullum and Jim Harrison, who are the new owners of the project on Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| I don't know whether you want to hear from Mr. Donaldson first on this issue or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| He has sent out a new memorandum to Council about some of the issues involved in the town center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| I think that might be helpful, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| I think we left it that you were going to see if you could have some clarity around some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| In an email that I provided to you yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I tried to summarize a little bit of the history of this particular issue in the town center zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| and provide a rationale for limiting drive-through facilities to banks and pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1098)|
| 0:18:28| In 2005, January of 2005, the City Council amended the TC1 district to provide for those drive-through facilities for banks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1108)|
| 0:18:41| and pharmacies after a request from the previous property owners and research by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| We recommended limitations on the number of lanes, locations that would not disrupt pedestrian flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| primarily on the basis that these types of facilities for banks and pharmacies could be used in remote sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| from the main building using pneumatic devices for collection and delivery of money and pharmacy goods, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1147)|
| 0:19:19| One of the things that we came across in doing our research was that it was noted that for prescription needs with a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1159)|
| 0:19:31| we wanted to provide those so that a sick person would not have to find a parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and walk some distance to a pharmacy in order to pick up a prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1177)|
| 0:19:45| With regard to banks, they very often have their drive-through facilities in a remote site, not even connected to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1185)|
| 0:19:56| So we thought there was a rationale for limiting the drive-through facilities to those two types of land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| As I mentioned, that sole amendment was enacted by the City Council in January of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| Subsequent to that, we have approved a development plan for a portion of North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| that includes a bank that has two drive-through lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| Essentially, we considered what we were proposing here as merely a house cleaning item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| because it was already provided for in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| We were simply moving it from one section to another to move it from an exception to prohibited uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| to a use considered on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| So I would encourage you to restore the provisions for the drive-through facilities in the amendment before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| in order to keep intact the amendment that you approved in January of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| What other zones prohibit drive-throughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| I don't know that any do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I thought one of the reasons behind town center zoning was to have something that was, for the most part, like no other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| that was supposed to encourage pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| Isn't that one of the purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| That is a stated purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Certainly, the provision of limited drive-through facilities does not inhibit pedestrian activity when properly placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1297)|
| 0:21:49| You talked about banks may have remote drive-through lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| Under what's being proposed, that's not required, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| No, but we have development plan approval for all development within the town center zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| So we see site plans prior to consideration by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| But just because they're seen doesn't mean that if that requirement is not there, then those are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| or that prohibition is not there, then those can be permitted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| They can be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| So your basis is that one of them was sick people might need to drive through a pharmacy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| It's one of them, yes, and that these facilities can be located remote from the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| and through the use of pneumatic delivery devices don't have to be connected to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| Well, I mean, suddenly you're starting to get on a slippery slope in that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| wouldn't sick people like to drive through McDonald's, Crystal's, Wendy's, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| Perhaps, but they don't have to do that to meet their prescriptive needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| No, but if they don't want to get out of their car to get something to take home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| I still share my concerns that I did two weeks ago that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| town center zoning was developed to have a higher and better pedestrian friendliness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| It was to be a zone pretty much like no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| And I know certain or no others may certainly disagree, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| but I just see this as a dilution of the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I'm going to go to Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I'll go to Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I just didn't see what lights came on when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| No, I would just comment that I think I did comment two weeks ago in regard to my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| about this particular development and this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| and being very familiar with the actions of this council in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| and then understanding how this property has been planned to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| and the size of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I think when we think of town centers, I think we generally think of a fairly contained, small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1461)|
| 0:24:31| This certainly is a very large acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| and the residential complex is not situated conveniently to the area in which the drive-through would likely be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1475)|
| 0:24:49| And I think that may be the reason that although in many gated communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| or many town center developments, there's generally not this kind of acreage that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| It's almost inconceivable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I don't know if you've been out and driven this entire development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Well, maybe it's my age or just maybe it's ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| I think it would be a stretch to expect that anyone who was not feeling well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| would not need to have the opportunity to be able to reach this part of the shopping district in the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:32| But I am so glad that we are bringing this back again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| because I think that the efforts to develop this area will be severely thwarted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| without the consideration of these two particular opportunities for drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| And I'm sure that Mr. Seymour can state that better than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| and I'm sure that I believe we have two other people here who are interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| But I'm just very glad that we're going to relook this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| because I believe it does not follow the thinking that this council passed in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1563)|
| 0:26:13| And so I don't know, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Mr. Becker, I'll ‑‑ yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Yeah, I guess, you know, Ms. Cross, in a lot of ways I agree with you about what should be in a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| And I think there's some discussion that could go either way about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| how valuable is it to have a zone that is different from every other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| even if it doesn't exist, versus, you know, getting another zone and how we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| The concern I have here and why I'm going to be changing my position on this issue is actually a process one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| in that this council has been really good at following a very fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| And we would not have decided anywhere along the line on another zoning issue to make this kind of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1607)|
| 0:26:57| I mean, what was happening here is other issues were being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| And MPC, because this was included in what we had, they made a change in the organization of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| This is a decision that was made four years ago to allow drive‑thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| We haven't had any of the public process on a discussion about what we're doing with drive‑thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| There was not ‑‑ part of the process on this was not, oh, we want to include or exclude drive‑thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| That was talked about in 2005 and not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| I don't think this is the proper process for making what is a substantial change in the TC1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| I know Mr. Swanson has opined that it's legal for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| I don't think it's right for us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| And I think just being legal isn't good enough in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| So I think I'm inclined to say I want to put the drive‑thrus back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| And I'd actually love to have a discussion about what we're actually changing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| which is allowing the TC1 to also have big box stores and lots of one story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| which is not the standard I'd like to see it settled at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| So I think there's some discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And I don't think it should be on drive‑thrus, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| And even though I could well agree with you in principle, in process, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| We'll go to Councilman Holquist and then back to Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I appreciate Councilman Frost's comments and some of the comments that Vice Mayor Becker made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| This animal called TC1, this town center mixed use zone that was created to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| as Councilman Frost said, pedestrian friendly, mixed use, sort of human scale development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| could end up being nibbled away at in small and large chunks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| where it ends up looking nothing like it was originally intended to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I'm getting over a cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| And one of the things that we're discovering, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Cumberland Avenue, we're not using TC1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| We're trying to develop a form‑based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| But we're running into a lot of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| because we're trying to redevelop an existing area on a major thoroughfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| with lots of curb cuts and driveway aprons and drive‑thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| And that is suburban style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| It is not mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| It is not pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| It goes back to the one story surrounded with parking and, you know, the typical fast food restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| It's a little different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| We're talking about a pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| But, you know, I'm sympathetic with what's trying to be accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| but I share Councilman Frost's concerns about where this is taking us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| I think that's what I hear him saying and what we might be losing in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I'm very much an advocate of mixed use and pedestrian friendly environments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| and trying to create those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| And it's difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| And if we water down the tools that we have to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| then I don't see us ever getting there, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| I think we're just going to end up with a lot of sort of half‑hearted attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| that really don't look much different from what we've done in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| and don't really satisfy those policy objectives that we're trying to steer towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| I'm not real comfortable with making changes like this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Mr. Donaldson, how many town center zonings do we have besides this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| This is the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| What is the likelihood that others will come in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| We had for a brief time an additional town center zoned area on the east part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| That particular development fell through and it was rezoned to a planned commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| Everything has to come together in line and with proper backing and proper demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1840)|
| 0:30:49| and the proper aggregate of land in order to make it happen, and those are relatively rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Well, I could see if we were trying to protect a zoning, a TC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| but I don't see anything in the near future where this would erode that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| I, like Mrs. Pelo, two weeks ago couldn't really understand why we would want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| and so I'm going to continue to be in favor of restoring the provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Mr. Seymour, did you have ‑‑ excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| There's not a motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Just to be clear, there's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| There is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| There is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| As I understand the motion, though, it is to adopt on second reading your actions from a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| and on behalf of the property owners who have the only TC1 zoning in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| we would ask that those provisions be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| These are new owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| They are local owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Carl Harrison, I think you all know most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| In an ideal world, you would maybe not have drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1925)|
| 0:32:13| We wouldn't have as many automobiles as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| But the world has changed a lot in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| Typical neighborhood uses include banks and pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| If they cannot have a drive-thru, you're not going to get them in a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| I don't know of a bank in this town that will operate outside of Center City without a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1952)|
| 0:32:41| that will build a new branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Same with pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| They simply will not open unless they have the opportunity for a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Banks and pharmacies have done a lot of research on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| People want the safety and security of being able to go to their bank after hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| use a drive-thru ATM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And people going to pharmacies have typically, if they're picking up a prescription,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| which these drive-thrus are used for, they have some illness that is requiring medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| and a lot probably have infirmities that prohibit them from parking or walking from their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| to the drugstore to get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| So we would ask that the ordinance go back to what it was from 2005 until the present amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2009)|
| 0:33:38| and then we'll be happy to discuss the present amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Mr. Seymour, I have a question for you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| My concern with removing the amendments that we enacted two weeks ago is opening the floodgates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| to other types of businesses that might prefer to have a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| And I guess I need to hear you articulate this evening how the use is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| and needed specifically by those exclusive of other businesses that might petition this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| or take this body to task for not allowing other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| How can those uses be defined in a way that they should be allowed and others should be excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| And that's the part I'm not hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Well, the ordinance before allowed drive-thrus for pharmacies and banks, correct, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| And no other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| First, I'll reiterate what I said a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| You're not going to get a bank or a pharmacy without a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| That's not a reason to disallow other drive-thru uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Well, I think the research that CVS and Walgreens and the others have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| certainly justifies that discrimination or distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| And the same with banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| And it is a safety and security issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| People coming to pick up a pharmacy or a prescription frequently have mobility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| They may not be able to get out of their car and walk any length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| or go from their home and walk any length to the pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| People going to ATMs have security issues going to those after normal banking hours on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| or a Sunday or after hours during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| The going through a drive-thru at a McDonald's is typically a convenience rather than a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2136)|
| 0:35:47| And same with other typical uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| It is at Starbucks, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| They all have drive-thrus, the suburban ones other than the Hilton Hotel downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| Mr. Donaldson, is the purchase of gasoline considered a drive-thru application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| No, that was one of the issues that we brought up during this latest process with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| and it was rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| There was a request to allow remote gas stations associated with grocery stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| and we decided not to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Okay, but I don't think that answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| If there were a petition to apply this more widely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| that the application of a drive-thru privilege applied to a pharmacy and a bank was exclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| in a way that was not well-defined and others should be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| does that open the door simply to McDonald's and Starbucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| or does it also open the door to the sale of gasoline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Is gasoline considered a drive-thru privilege in a zoning application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| It's not called out in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Mr. Frost, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Mr. Seymour, were you the one who talked about drive-thru privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| that I heard Councilman Roddy just discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| She asked you a couple of good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and I haven't heard a distinction with a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| I mean, if you are sick, you should get to go through the pharmacy drive-thru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| but you shouldn't get to go through any other sort of drive-thru other than a pharmacy or a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| That's true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Well, under the T.C. Zone, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| And I assume you all made these findings in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| when you all enacted the amendments to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| allowing drive-thrus only for pharmacies and banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| And isn't it possible and actually, I mean, confirm it with the Deputy Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| people get mugged walking between the drive-thru and their car or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| a fast food restaurant and their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| So, you know, there's a security issue there for restaurants too, isn't it, there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| I assume people have been mugged about anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| I know there's two other speakers signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Mr. Seymour, would you like, and Mr. Cullum and Mr. Harrison, would you all like to speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2311)|
| 0:38:40| If you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| I think Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Seymour have summed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| I would like to say Mr. Harrison and I arranged a group of local investors just three or four months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| We purchased a defaulted note on this property and then went and ultimately foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Our group is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| We are in the very, very early stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| It could be a year before we have any concrete plans that we could bring before this council as far as actual development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2347)|
| 0:39:17| In fact, I hate to admit this, but we didn't even realize that this had gone before council on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2357)|
| 0:39:26| And I think we're here to simply say we've heard everything that's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| At this stage, we can appreciate and respect, frankly, every comment from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| We really don't feel like we need to be – we've got a project that – keep in mind, we purchased a defaulted note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| And this project struggled for four to five years before it ultimately went into foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2389)|
| 0:39:59| And at this stage of the game, we would rather not be putting even more restrictions on the future of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| I could stand here at this point and offer my own philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| I could debate both sides of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| I really don't think that at this stage of the game we're here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| I think we're here to ask this council to at least restore it back to where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| Rest assured, I think Mr. Harrison and I will be before this council again, if not once, probably several times with many plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| This is going to be – even with where we are and, if you will, in putting new life into the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| it's still going to be a multiyear effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| There are many things about the town center zone that we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| I said exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| However, as a developer with 20-plus years of experience and, Mr. Harrison, I think even more experience than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2459)|
| 0:41:09| I think he just called you old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| You took the words out of my mouth, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| But not to call you old, but when we – at this stage of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| to be placing even more restrictions on a property that has struggled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| we're not going to be able to have any development plan approved without coming back before Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| his staff, his commission, and this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And we would just ask right now that we at least let it revert back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| And if anyone has a question for me, I'll be happy to get back up and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| I guess I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I'd actually like to hear you talk more about why you like a town center zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| because there's an interesting level of you could decide to get this rezoned for C4 and do whatever you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| And clearly you're not thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| You're staying involved in this and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| So I guess that's a question I've got for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Why do you want a town center zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| What's your – why is that exciting to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| This may not be a real good answer, but I like the look of it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| However, let me temper that with the fact that our group has invested many millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| and it's all cash equity investment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| So I have to temper ultimately everything that I do with what ultimately makes economic sense in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2551)|
| 0:42:41| And I can look at plans and I can drive through communities and love the look of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| And I have been through some town centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Some people refer to it as new urbanism development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| And I really like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I can – I've driven through some that have been attempted and have failed miserably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I've been through some that have succeeded wildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| I don't think this council has the time right now to hear me postulate on why some failed and why some succeeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| We may get to that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| But I think that there are aspects of the town center zone that can not only work economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2599)|
| 0:43:29| but can add to the looks, the fabric, however you want to couch it, of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| I think there are some areas of it where maybe we get lost and we talk about pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| I think creating pedestrian flow is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| What people have to remember, at least as it relates to this development specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| is that there's probably a maximum of 300 to 400 housing units that may ever actually be on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2633)|
| 0:44:04| As Councilwoman Pelo pointed out, the predominant amount of those are quite a walk if you're walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| But to give the benefit of the doubt, if those people, all of the people that live in this development can walk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| that's still not enough people that can economically support a retail business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| and by retail, whether I'm talking about banking, pharmacy, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| So, whether we want to realize it or not, our world has changed since the time true urban cores were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2674)|
| 0:44:43| By that, look at Market Square, look at Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Those buildings and that plat was laid out when we didn't have automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| This world is driven by automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| So, for us to try to develop 100-plus acres of retail office commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| and make that rely on 300 to 400 housing units by pedestrian and, in the process, tell –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| first of all, I think everyone realizes that won't work, but in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| to try to say to all of the rest of the residents in the surrounding community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| whether that's a one-mile, two-mile, three-mile, five-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| that the only way that you can shop here is we're not going to give you the convenience that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| over the course of many years, retailers who are investing their at-risk capital have determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| that what shoppers, for the most part, want, whether it's Starbucks, whether it's Walgreens, whether it's CVS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| whether it's Regions Bank, Clayton Bank, they want the convenience of drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| because, predominantly, our communities are based, whether we like it or not, around the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| I like the looks of town center zoning, and I think that adhering to some of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| will help possibly move the ball back a little bit toward yesteryear and what we're after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| But to say that we can go all the way back to the turn of the century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| and expect our business people to adhere to a set of rules that, right on the other side of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2780)|
| 0:46:29| that Kroger and Walgreens over there don't have to adhere to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| and expect them to invest millions of dollars and hope to be successful might be a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2793)|
| 0:46:41| Anyway, in that answer, that was way too long, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| You said two questions, did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Well, I just was going to comment that, you know, we have, some of us have been very interested in this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| from the beginning, particularly because it is a town center, because it is a different type development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| And I think those individuals who decided to early on become a part of the residential community there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| expected that they were moving into a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I think that the planning was very carefully done to, as Mr. Collum commented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| to respect the wishes of the neighborhoods and the communities that there are many neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| which are west of this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| And I think their interests and their concerns, Mr. Donaldson, if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| were given strict consideration when you began to create some of these distinctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| and applied some of these restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Am I not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I want that also at the request of some of the adjoining neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| With this latest amendment, we did have a public meeting in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| that was well attended by adjacent and surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| My understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| The issue was brought up simply, we described the housekeeping aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| We were simply moving this provision from one spot to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| But there was a lot of discussion about gas stations and fast food franchises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| And I think there were some strong feelings and comments that you listened to, heard very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| And I'm sure that Mr. Collum and Mr. All the other investors are very, I know Mr. Harrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| and Mr. Collum well enough to know they listen carefully to what the market is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| and what their market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| But this is a very huge tract of land and it has enormous possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| for that part of our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| And it has been a disappointment that it has moved very slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| And I think now there are those who are very familiar with what this market needs and wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| And I think it's an opportunity to create a very unique living environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| But I do feel strongly that more restrictions are going to really limit their capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| And I still feel that the town center concept is being, I've been, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2970)|
| 0:49:41| and I think it was Ronnie who commented that she had visited various town centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Well, so have I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| And a lot of how that design can be played out and how it works out has a great deal to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| with whether the area that is going to service the residents is in the center of that town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=2993)|
| 0:50:02| or whether it's on the periphery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| And here the commercial retail development, the office area is all toward the front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3004)|
| 0:50:14| And really the residential is on the very, very rear of the property with a very interesting topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| So I think all of those things have to be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| And if we're going to hope to see this succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| and for all of us who pay into the tax base of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| I think we certainly desire not only for these investors to succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| but we desire for it to succeed for the future of the development of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| So I really am so glad that we are reconsidering these restrictions that were about to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| maybe unwisely, in my opinion, placed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Mr. Douglas, there's been a gentleman waiting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Do you want me to call on him first, or would you like me to come to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Sir, if you'd come give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| David Brockwalter, 813 Mapler's Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| It seems a little obvious, and yet I haven't already mentioned that if people have concerns about convenience or security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| if they're in their car, there are certainly other banks and other pharmacies not too far down the road that they can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| So I don't see why this kind of a concept needs to be compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| If they have the option of getting in their car and going another mile or two somewhere in another direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| and the same could be said for people who live outside of the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| they could make use of other facilities, other banks, other pharmacies in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| So I just thought that seemed like something that wasn't being said, and I wanted that to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Well, listening to Mr. Collins' assessment, I really appreciate what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| I think he's got a very good handle on the issues that they have to deal with there and what they're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| And I guess one of the concerns that I have actually with the town center zoning itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| and I didn't really articulate this in my previous statement, is that it's not a one-size-fits-all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| but it is our town center zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| And it's not designed to be customized to a particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| As Councilman Pelos said, this particular site is, like all sites, unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| It's a fairly good-sized parcel of property, the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| And the town center is not the center is not in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| It's on the edge and adjacent to the major roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| And that's going to vary from development to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| Mr. Collins said he's seen a lot of developments like this around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| I assume some wildly successful and some pretty significant failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| So it does have to be sensitive to the particular set of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And one of the things we're trying to do with form-based coding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| and form-based zoning is essentially adopt specialized zoning that tries to meet certain objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| but it's custom fit to a particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Each new rezoned area, when it's rezoned using form-based code, is zoned specifically for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3207)|
| 0:53:36| It's all laid out and it's defined and codified in terms of the particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| Usually it's by district by district within the overall rezoning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| And it's very sensitive to the conditions that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| And we really can't do that with a single TC, one zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| So I'm really very much sympathetic with what Mr. Collins is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| And I'm not sure where the best way to go is with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Because, again, I'm concerned about sort of the camel's nose under the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| If we say, well, we're going to allow this now, then someone's going to come inevitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| And it won't be while I'm on council, but someone's going to come back and say, well, golly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| you guys allowed drive-throughs for pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And it's just not fair to us if we can't have drive-throughs for fill in the blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| And so, you know, dry cleaners or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| So I'm really torn about this because I hear what Mr. Collins is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| and I think he's got a really valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| But we're talking about we're tweaking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Councilman Bailey said, well, how many others are around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Well, this is the only one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| My guess is that we may or may not see a lot more TC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| We may see a lot of form-based code and really not go in this direction in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| So I don't know how much of an issue it is, but I know we do need to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| And I guess I'm just at this point sort of thinking out loud and articulating my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| and feeling torn both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| But I'm not real happy with the idea of watering it down, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| But in the long run, I think we're going to have to deal with it in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| That's probably form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Yeah, I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| One, I just come back to the fact that we made a decision about drive-throughs four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| And, again, I don't feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| But I want to make a couple motions to get discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| It hasn't been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Well, I get discussion going in a direction where we get someplace maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| I'm going to make three, and I'm going to tell you what all three are more and then make one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| I'm going to make a motion to postpone after we've talked about this for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| because I think this is a big enough issue for us to continue to discuss later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| I'd like us to get actually on what the gist of what this proposal is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| So I think I'm going to make a motion at some point to change the percentage in G1F from 25% to 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3363)|
| 0:56:12| just to get back on what's actually proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| But I think the first motion I'm going to make is to restore the language in D4 that is on the page that allows drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3374)|
| 0:56:26| This is what was approved in 2005 with some additional clarifications to make sure that only banks and pharmacies are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| So I'm making a motion to put back all the language in Section D4 that is currently marked through on your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| What did you mention about Section G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Yeah, this is actually the change that is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Section G, there are the proposals there for – I mean, this is actually the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| And what it is, it's allowing more one-story buildings in a town center zone, which is what the change is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| And I want to get the discussion back on that and away from drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| I am worried a little bit, this camel under the nose of the tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| And what feels to me is we're being – what's coming to us is a significant change in TC1s that involve big box stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| and one-story buildings, and we're focused on drive-throughs, and I'd like to get off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| So making the first motion to get off drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Ms. Roddy, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| This is germane to Vice Mayor Becker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| I understand the concerns that this development team has with providing the convenience of pharmacies and banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3454)|
| 0:57:42| However, two weeks ago when we discussed this, we specifically asked Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| and Mr. Swanson was a part of this discussion as to why those two exceptions could be justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| I understand Vice Mayor Becker saying, well, we did this in 2005, therefore we just need to keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| I don't buy into the fact that because we were coming before it was necessarily the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| I don't feel like I have adequate justification to allow two certain types of businesses and not others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| And, you know, I think the argument that a Starbucks on the perimeter or a dry cleaner located on the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| is not necessarily an egregious use, might be for convenience, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| And I don't – in a challenged situation, I have yet to hear language or justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3503)|
| 0:58:32| that allows me to be comfortable with picking out two specific classes of business in this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| And, again, as has been mentioned tonight, this applies to all town center zonings, not this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| And that's been difficult to differentiate in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| But I have not yet heard a defensible reason to pick out these two classes of businesses in our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| to allow them a specific privilege and not others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| And that's why I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| I would love – I'd love to be able to – I want this development to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| but I cannot find a defensible reason for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| I guess this question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| I sort of got lost in all this discussion about the drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| In 2005, we allowed drive-thrus for banks and pharmacies in the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| In 2005, you amended the original district, which was first brought in, in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| In 2005, you amended that to allow drive-thru facilities for banks and pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| When Mr. Cullum and his partners bought this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| they were under the assumption they could have drive-thrus for banks and pharmacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| And we have approved a bank in a portion of the district with two drive-thru lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| Well, to me, that really gets to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| In my opinion, you know, when somebody buys something with the intentions of doing a legal purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| and then we as a governmental body go about changing that legal purpose in which they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| that they wanted to use the property for, there's just something wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| And, I mean, we shouldn't have the ability to even consider doing that without compensating them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| or giving them something in exchange for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| And that's just incomprehensible to me that we would even consider doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Right now, the motion on the floor is to amend by restoring D4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Just so everybody knows, there is a 4-4 tie here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| There could possibly be a 4-4 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| I'm not – again, because of land use still, I haven't ever voted in those and won in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| So, just so everybody knows that up front because we're missing a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Ms. Mitchell, you probably just call the roll on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| I heard five ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| So, the first amendment is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Mr. Becker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I'm going to make an amendment to get us on what's actually here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| I'd like to move to, in Section G1F, currently says the ground floor area of one-story buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3698)|
| 1:01:50| and one-and-a-half-story buildings shall not exceed 25% of the total ground floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| I want to reduce that to 10% there and later in that same paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| And that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| I'll second the motion because I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Right now, the motion and the second is to change the 25% to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| Just what it's saying is right now, of all the first floors in the development, 25% of them can be on buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| that are one-story alone and you're proposing to change that to 10% of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Just so everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Now, Ms. Pilo, your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| What is your thinking, Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I need to know what you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I think that a lot of what's been said about drive-thrus, I don't want to say it all again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| but the town centers have a very different feel to them and it is, I think the phrase new urbanist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| or even urbanist is what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| The town centers, the core area, which is what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| is designed to be pedestrian-friendly and it's designed to be vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| We want a density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| We want something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| And the significant change in the town center, one, as I understand it, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| that's being talked about here is going to that core verticality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| It's moving from something where everything or close to everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| and I'm not up on this and Mr. Donaldson can tell me I'm completely off base on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| is that currently the core of the town center is designed to be a multi-story development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| and we are changing that to allow lots of one-story developments and a big box store that's one-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| And I'm going to suggest that we shouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| We should limit this to two-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| That is a core value of the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| and it's what the fundamental change here that's being presented to us is, and I have an opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| Well, I would like to hear Mr. Collum apparently has an opinion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| so I would be interested in hearing your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I was just stretching my legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Oh, well, that sounds like a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| I haven't asked my attorney this, so hopefully he doesn't start throwing things at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| but one of the things that was established earlier is that this property is the only property in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| currently zoned TC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| We've just purchased this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It's a huge property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| It's struggled for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| We have a lot of work to do that could take 6, 12, 18, 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| This council and MPC ultimately is going to decide what we bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| However, what's ultimately going to decide what happens on this property are the users who are willing to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3874)|
| 1:04:43| hard-earned, at-risk capital in the form of retailers, office users, homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3883)|
| 1:04:52| We, as developers and our architects and our engineers, can lay out all the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| We can talk with Mr. Donaldson and his staff, and we can come before this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| and talk about all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| But we have an experimental, if you will, if you'll permit me, zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| This is the only property that's zoned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And we're spending a lot of time right now arguing over drive-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| and how much is two-story and how much is one-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| And, really, what's ultimately going to decide this is when we have people willing to lay their cash on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| based on a design, and we come back before Mr. Donaldson and his staff initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| and if it makes it past that, we go before the MPC as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| And if it makes it, however, through that or not, it comes before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| So as much as I said earlier that we would not like to be putting more restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| I'm wondering whether we need to debate this or whether you as a council need to debate this anymore right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3955)|
| 1:06:06| because we're going to be back before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I could sit here and say we're going to come out and we're going to have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| and there's not going to be any change at all that this council needs to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| It's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| We've got a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| That doesn't happen with our code where we have zoning classifications that have been in place for 30, 40, 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| 20, 30, however long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| We've got a code and a classification that's experimental, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| It's experimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| This is the only property that's that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And so far, other than 23 houses, nothing's been developed on it in six years of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| I think probably to sum up Mr. Cullum's comments, he'd say refer to Steve Hall's earlier comments about what they bought going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| And I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I understand where Mr. Becker is trying to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| But I don't know if we really can in the second reading of something spring it upon them, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4023)|
| 1:07:11| I think, you know, there's got to be an opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| There's got to be opportunity for the new owners of the project to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| I can't, whether I agree or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| I ultimately believe that they have the opportunity to come in, be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| and it probably should be at a future meeting or a workshop on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4052)|
| 1:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I guess, Mr. Frost, that's why I was going to propose the postponement, to say we do need more time to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4064)|
| 1:07:54| Again, this is the central part of what's been debated in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Drive-throughs were an administrative change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| The change to allow more one story is what is being changed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And that's a core value in TC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| So I actually believe we do have the right to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| But, again, I plan to postpone it so we do have more time to think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| and, frankly, to get Mr. Woodhull involved in the discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| Now, for what it's worth, I think it's Mr. Swanson's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| With the change made with the First Amendment, this would go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| So I wouldn't even need to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| That would be sort of an automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Well, it would be the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| This would now be first reading, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Now, Mr. Swanson, do I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| That's a substantive change in what you passed, and so you would go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| So this evening is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| If it stays as it is, if you go back to the way it was before you made the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| then it would be second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Yes, if Councilman, if Vice Mayor Becker's amendment passes, it's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| But where we are right now, if it doesn't pass, we're still on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| No, I think you just passed the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| We've already passed the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| So now if it passes in its current amended form, it's in the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| The First Amendment passed five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Restoring the drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Is that a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Oh, that was a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Yes, that was a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I should have been more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| We've already had the substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| We're already in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| But because I would suspect the developers are kind of nervous right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| I think they were nervous when they brought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| If we, even this is, if something passes on first reading, I'm not sure that it still should happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| because it will be going into second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| There won't be the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| There's not enough time with Thanksgiving in there to give them the opportunity to try to figure out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| this reduction from 25% to 10% and any other proposed amendments you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| I just think this needs to be postponed so these gentlemen can figure out what the impact of the proposals may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4194)|
| 1:10:05| or may not have on them and talk to others and talk to planners about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| Do you all have any comment toward, actually, what's on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| Maybe I should hold that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Maybe it is an approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Do you all have any comment toward postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| I made a comment to the Vice Mayor today that if you all, this existing council has two more meetings, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| After this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| After this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| If we cannot get this wrapped up within those two meetings, there will be five new council members up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| and perhaps we ought to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| We would like to wrap it up quickly, but we want to do it in a way that protects this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4245)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| That would be my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I appreciate that, Arthur, but ultimately I get real antsy and nervous, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| when I've got someone ready to pay me money for my deed or to start paying rent, and we're nowhere close to that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| And as I said before, ultimately that's when we're going to be before this council if we need to be for any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4272)|
| 1:11:21| It's almost, I don't know how administratively, Mayor, that this happens, but it's almost like take it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| leave the town center zoning where it is, and we will be working with Mr. Donaldson and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| and you'll probably hear from us in six months or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| But what Mr. Becker is proposing is a fairly significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| And just from your all's body language, it sounds like tonight's the first night you've heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4302)|
| 1:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Probably wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| We maybe should have known about it, but that would be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Well, let's just say his proposal gets voted on and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Well, it just got heard on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Are you all going to, in the next two weeks' worth of time, have the ability to digest it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| and whether or not you want to support it, oppose it, or somewhere in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| He's done all the talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| While you're doing that, Ms. Riley, would you like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| And I guess although my vote on the last amendment wouldn't reflect this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I do think Mr. Hall made an important point about the zoning code under which a buyer purchases a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| and the rights conveyed thereunto and changing horses midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| What was the requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| This specific, because we don't have marked copies or they're marked in a way that they don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| this language is bolded, so that indicates to me that it is an addition that was not in the town center's zoning before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| So how were the ground floor areas relative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| I believe this addresses a ratio of ground floor areas to total development areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| Was that addressed previously, and was there a 10% number like Vice Mayor Becker is suggesting to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| My understanding, it was zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| I mean, if you read what's here, it was zero before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| And this proposal is to move it to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| I'm a little concerned about Mr. Frost sort of saying I'm springing something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| The purpose of this is, and I wasn't called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| I was actually asking Mr. Donaldson that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| I know. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| That was rude of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I'm glad you're knowledgeable, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Very rude of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Keep in mind that these amendments were initiated first upon request by the previous landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4417)|
| 1:13:46| who was working in an environment where he was trying to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| He was being approached by users who wanted big boxes, single-story development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4433)|
| 1:14:06| and we wanted to help him to the extent that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| and keep the intent of the town center zoning intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| So we started from zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| The current code requires two-story development in the core area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| with a smaller list of exceptions than you have here, the unbolded exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4463)|
| 1:14:34| So given that it was zero to start with, basically zero to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| and we certainly wanted to keep the majority of development more than one story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| so somewhere between zero and 50%, there was a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| We looked at a whole lot of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| and we kept moving towards that 25% ratio where one in four feet along a block face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| could be a one-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| So back to my original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| If these amendments were initiated by a previous owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| and they're just coming to us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I'm trying to figure out where the current owners were in their understanding of what they were buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| I mean, was it a pig and a poke, or they knew this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| I mean, had this passed MPC at the time that they chose to take on this opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| This was recommended by MPC last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| I believe the week that we had the public meeting out in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| we were introduced to these fellows as the new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| or the new perspective owners at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| So they were hearing about it at the same time that the neighbors were, which was mid-summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4543)|
| 1:15:53| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| I guess this is to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| From what it sounds like to me, your clients don't really know exactly what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| So wouldn't they be better off if we just withdrew this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| and let it come back up at another point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| We were just talking about that, Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| And somebody asked me what we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| We would like a referral back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| on our development plans under the zone as it stood a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| Can we have this epiphany an hour ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| I'll make a motion to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Mr. Hookless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Is that a motion to withdraw or a motion to refer back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Because doesn't a motion to refer back take precedence also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| I know it's not officially in Robert's rules, but give Mr. Swanson a headache here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| I could do like Victor and quote you a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| I think probably a motion to withdraw is going to take precedence, but I'm making it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Well, if you're years away from 18 months or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| wouldn't you be better off to withdraw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| And then whenever you come up with something, I mean, because you can work with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| We may end up like Councilman Hawkless said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| These guys may end up asking for a form-based code for this property, depending on what they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4634)|
| 1:17:23| I mean, I think we all want to see this piece of property develop to its highest potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and don't want it just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| And so what we do want is something that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| I think he's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Mr. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| I told Arthur that I loved your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| It may just be that just true form-based zoning may be where we end up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Well, I was just going to come up with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Well, I think we're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Mr. Hall, is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| I think we're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Right now, the motion that takes precedence that's on the floor is a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Am I right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| We're going to act like it is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| We're not the applicant here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| The motion on the floor is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| An hour late, but we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4702)|

| 1:21:47| Would these development bonds go with the property or I guess what I'm trying to say is it's my understanding that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=4907)|

| 1:25:11| and that many of our citizens are participating in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| I think this is, you know, hate to spend money and hate to certainly have to hate to add to unbudgeted money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| but I think this is a very, very promising note for today's environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| So I have to congratulate everybody for being part of this, a part of the necessity to spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5128)|

| 1:25:54| I'll be disappointed if I didn't say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Dr. Lyons, is this your spear to catch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| Sure, I'll catch the spear if you want to throw it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Actually, I drove by the parking lot on the way to Beardport tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I'm glad to see it was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Are we presently charging anything to park there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| We're not presently charging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Are we going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| We're looking for ways to charge possibly after the first of the year if we can find a way not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| not inconvenience the businesses that we inconvenienced with the construction of the 100 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| and certainly looking to find a way to put a charge on the lot once that construction is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| So we're going to end our obligation by purchase of this lot to pay, was it started at $10,000 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| and escalated up to $12,000 or $13,000 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| It escalates at the halfway point, which we're about at to $11,000, from $10,000 to $11,000 something, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| So we've paid approximately $120,000 a year for how many years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| This would be four plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| And then we're taking it off the tax rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| Well, we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| It's off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| I don't see that there's really other any competing buyer for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| When you look at different ways to appraise property, one, of course, is the income method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| And, you know, I'm sure part of the appraisal probably somewhere or other took into account what we were paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| monthly to lease the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| I've just, you know, certainly others can disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I've never felt this was particularly a good deal for the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091117?start=5255)|
