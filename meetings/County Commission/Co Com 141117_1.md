| 2:43:45| The Sessions Court judges have a, they're constitutionally limited to a maximum of a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9825)|
| 2:43:54| The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, anything short of a jury trial, $50 is the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| If they go higher than that, you have to have a jury trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| and this body is the next appellate station in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9844)|
| 2:44:11| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| And there's not much we, meaning we, this body can do about that other than the civil side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| and we have no jurisdiction over the employee because they're not the license holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| So it's like me riding in a car and, you know, Brad's speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| He gets a ticket, but they can't write me one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| That's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| The store will get the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| The license holder will get the ticket, but they can't ride the guy in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| Yeah, Mr. Wright, that's where I was wanting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| Until we can put some, and apparently we can't without the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| until we can put some teeth into the person actually selling the beer, because it's usually not the store owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9888)|
| 2:44:55| My family was in this business for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| You can do everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| You can preach it like a preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| But sometimes you get an employee that's just going to do what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| And until those employees have something with some teeth that will bite them, they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9906)|
| 2:45:12| They get caught, you fire them, you have to pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| You know, and that, I guess I'm struggling with the way we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| I thought the initial conversation was about these repeat offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| these folks we're seeing here time and time again, not the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| I mean, in my six years here, I've, there's been some egregious first-time offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9934)|
| 2:45:42| but really it's those repeat folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| So, you know, I think that's where we need to get aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| And it sounds like we have that avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| A good memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| That's right, a good memory, haven't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| I've seen you here, another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| Okay, we can now, we can pull off all of the fluff and get to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9957)|
| 2:46:03| But just to say we're going to go first-time offenders, $750, that's a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| Because like Commissioner Smith said, there's a lot of folks out there that's really trying to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| It's out there, you know, trying to make a living, trying to hire good people, failing sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9973)|
| 2:46:19| And $500 is a hit on an average business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| It's a big hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| The reason they don't take the suspension is if they are, if there's a notion that they don't sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9985)|
| 2:46:33| the person will keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| And that first time they pass their convenience store up, they may not ever come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| So they're going to always pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| I mean, that's just going to happen because they can't afford not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| So I guess, you know, again, if we're consistent with how we're issuing these fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10003)|
| 2:46:54| you know, be honest, if I'm just, you know, we've had some folks come up here with some language barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| We can't let that jade us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| If there is a consistent issue, I'm fine to increase fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| But, you know, if we get angry with them or someone smarts off at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| there can't be a reason for us to increase the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| They may be a jerk, but they may not deserve that increased fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| So I would just hope that we're consistent with how we're vetting these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| That's why I kind of like the guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| Maybe we can, as a policy, we can go up on a second-time guidance to $1,000 to $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10042)|
| 2:47:28| And that's our guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| If we get someone that's just really out there, you can take it up to $2,000 to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10049)|
| 2:47:35| So that's just kind of my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Just briefly, what I've heard is that, okay, if we up the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| but that's after they get caught and they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| What about us use this as a preemptive thing and send out that letter to everyone saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10067)|
| 2:47:52| do you know that you can be fined $2,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| Up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| Up to $2,500 for selling beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| And maybe they'll start talking and start using that in their stores with their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| and we can catch them before they actually get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| And then use the discretion of six votes and put on them whatever we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| But I think that $2,500 is a scare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| I mean, that would make a difference if you were a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| You would want to make sure that they weren't selling beer to minors as much as you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| We'll get a letter constructed to put inside the notice before December the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| Can we do something to ask the state to put some bite into the actual individuals that are selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10112)|
| 2:48:38| We have to contact the delegation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| We can do that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| We could call Ryan and try to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10122)|
| 2:48:46| Anybody else got anything before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| We adjourn until 5 o'clock for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10128)|
| 2:48:55| Zoning meeting, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141117?start=10135)|
