| 2:35:39| Do I think that there's other folks out there that might be able to do a better job as mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Do I think that the mayor's done some things that have inhibited his ability to lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| Now, I know I'm going to get in a lot of trouble in my district for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| but do I think that it's risen to the point that he should be ran out of office on a rail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| I don't think it's reached that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| So I'm going to vote no, but I'm going to ask the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| There's a lot of folks out there that are very disappointed in the way you've operated your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| and I hope you'll see this as a wake-up call and do better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Commissioner Moore, if you wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| Well, I mean, it doesn't do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| I mean, it's already done, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:33| You know, if I thought, if it would have been anybody else, they'd have been fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| So, I mean, I've tried to do things today, and we keep throwing obstacles up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| except passing things that don't mean anything, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:49| What's your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| It don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| It passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| It fails two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| Yes, 13 no, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9417)|
| 2:37:06| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| I believe we covered all the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| I would like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| I'm going to be placing you on the agenda next month just to give people a heads up to do away with the P-Card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| program and go back to the purchase orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| I mean, I think that would save us a lot of time, and I hate it for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| but if we're not, if we don't have people capable enough to manage it, we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9444)|
| 2:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I'd like to ask about the Club LaConte membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| Who authorized that for Cynthia to get a membership at Club LaConte on the county's dime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| Mr. Pinkston already asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Ain't nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| Nobody would tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| We adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9476)|
