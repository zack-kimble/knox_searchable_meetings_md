| 0:01:57| In the meantime, let's go to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=118)|

| 0:02:19| Allen Wolfie May, Noscosh Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| On June 15, 2011, I conducted an underage beer sting at Raceway Market, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:35| and purchased a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And it's my understanding that there was a violation here two years ago, albeit it was a different owner, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Will the representative of the organization come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| Mohammed Satig, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| Sir, did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Do you have any testimony you'd like to give or do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Nothing to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| The clerk told me when I asked her, she was crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| She said that she did check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| She misread the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| It was 1993, and she thought that she read like 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| She's a very experienced clerk, but this is the first time things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| It is out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Then I asked her, I can't even fire her, but I didn't fire her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| Another class for the beer, and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| It's my understanding then that you had her take an additional training course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Mr. Chairman, I'll turn it over to the commission for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| My question is, had she been through the server training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| I'd like to make a motion, if nobody else has any questions, for a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Motion to make the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| If not, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Motion passes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| So you have your option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| And the option, Mr. Law Director, is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Sir, you can either pay a $500 fine within seven days to the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| or your license could be suspended for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I will pay $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| The gentleman to your left can tell you how to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Next we have an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Clerk, if you'd read the application item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| What about ASTEC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| It's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| ASTEC was withdrawn because the information that we received was inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| I'm sorry, I should have mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| It has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=282)|

| 0:05:14| And what is your representative capacity to this entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| I would be the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and then we'll be turning some inquiries over to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| Have you or any of your employees of this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Has beer been sold to this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=341)|

| 0:05:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| So there's presently no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| My understanding, you're looking for an on and off permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Now, will you actually own the physical property and the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| No, I would rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=355)|

| 0:06:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Who else has an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Do you have any corporate partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Just my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| So it's safe to assume that you and your wife will be operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=376)|

| 0:06:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| I'm going to turn it over to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=391)|

| 0:06:41| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| There's a problem with the 500-foot rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| He's 352 to one side and 333 to another, so he would have to have a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| In accordance with our Tennessee Zoning Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| if you're within 500 feet of a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| you would need a variance in order to have on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| It does not apply to off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| The permit is for both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| so it would be whether or not this gentleman is going to insist on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| If he does, then you'll have to defer this until such time as he gets a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| So what is your pleasure with regards to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| Well, so I could go ahead and get the off-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| If you want an on-premise, you're going to have to get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| and bring this back before the commission to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| Well, at this point, I more than likely will not open the business if I cannot do the on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| But I guess if we're just following the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| I might go ahead and do the off-premise and then make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| So at this point, you're merely seeking an off-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| and you're essentially reserving the right to reapply later down the road for an on-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| At this point, if that's my option, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| We still haven't heard from the fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| They need to get an interior permit to move into the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| We have Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| And you answered a lot of what I was going to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| But I guess as a start, I'd like to understand exactly what are you doing in this business in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| and I'll tell you what I'm trying to get to, what the need for on and off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| I'm just trying to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Basically, we have a location now where we're basically like a cigar tobacco outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| So in this location, we were wanting to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| we sell off-premise beer at our current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| At this location, we wanted to also have, you know, beer to go along with the cigar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| and have like a setting, like kind of a cigar lounge type setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| You know, and I think it's been pretty well established that, I mean, this is your first applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| We can't say yeah or nay, but I guess I would say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| I think what I can say is that if, heaven forbid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| someone have a few beers, whatnot, at your place and you give them a six-pack to go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| and something, you know, unforeseen happened, that would not be a good thing as far as the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| But again, so I don't like that, but I cannot like it all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| I don't think we can stop you from getting that if you meet all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| So as you take this off-premises permit, just kind of let that marinate a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| and think about, you know, some of the consequences of an unlikely event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I'll make a motion to approve amended application of off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Pending certificate of occupancy, I believe, for the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Good luck to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| You're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Oh, there was one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Commissioner Brown, there was one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| I don't want to be presumptuous, but I'm wondering, did someone from the Takoa Lounge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| If you could read that item into the record, please, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| She'll probably need to swear in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| She will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I'm going to wait for her to get to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Ma'am, we're going to be asking you a series of questions, but before that, I want to have you swear in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| If you would stand and raise your right hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you will give here today will be the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| What we'll do first, ma'am, is we're going to hear from the beer inspector from the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| and then you'll be afforded the opportunity to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Madam Clerk, could you reread that into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Takoa Lounge, 6659 Oak Ridge Highway, Christina L. Johnson, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| Officer, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| On June 15, 2011, I conducted an underage beer sting at the Takoa Lounge, 6659 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| I sent two underage minors in, and they both purchased Corona and Coors Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:23| Switching brands, Moofy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| We've moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| All right, ma'am, would you step forward, please, to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Did you hear his testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Oh, I agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| It took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| I make a motion for a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Mr. Law Director, you explain once again her options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Ma'am, under our code, your options are this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| One, you can take a 30-day suspension of your license, or the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| you can pay a $500 fine within seven days to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Within seven days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I'd rather choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| If you speak to the gentleman to your left, my right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| they'll advise you as to whom to fill out the check, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I have nothing further for the commission on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| No other business before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| We are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| We are now going to move into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| This is the public forum segment of the Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| We have one individual who has signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| so John Dickle, if you would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| My name is John Dickle, 1530 Bexhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| And you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Thank you for allowing me to come speak with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| I am the school nutrition director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| I am a new Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I started with the district August 2nd of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| And I'm also your food policy council representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| one of your food policy council representatives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| What I wanted to do is I just wanted to come by and introduce myself to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| because I think you've seen a lot of business come across your plates as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| bids that we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| It's been a very busy year since I arrived in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| We've had a very aggressive agenda as far as trying to do bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| and trying to reshape the way that we do business and do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| And so it's been a very exciting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I really wanted to kind of give kudos to Hugh Holt, his leadership team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| his group of buyers, and Christy Julian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| who has been very helpful with the school nutrition department in helping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| with our bids and helping me move along the change that I'm trying to introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| And I just really wanted to say thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| We have been looking for opportunities to partner, and we're real excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| We actually will be hosting an August 29th event where we're going to be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| with organizations that have a local interest in trying to find opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| for them to do business with Knox County School Nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| And so I just wanted to say thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| and I look forward to doing work in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| Great. Thank you, sir, and welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Also, I'd like to recognize Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, who has a special proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| Mayor Burchett, thank you for joining us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Would it be possible if Tracy Foster came down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| And the principal is out of detention for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Well, as many of you know, my father, everybody would always say they went to see my father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| and I'd say, well, because he handled the discipline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| but he also handled the Freshman Honor Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Of course, usually, other than Ed Schaus, nobody else was ever in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| But this actually came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| Come on up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| He's got the small screen lens on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| I was actually watching TV one night with my wife and my mother-in-law, of all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| and it was national news, and I wasn't paying much attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| because there wasn't much good news on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| But then they said this lady was from Knoxville, Tennessee, and it caught my eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| And if it would be appropriate, Mr. Chairman, if I could read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| This is, whereas Project Bean, there is a charitable organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| working to improve the lives of orphans living in Vietnam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| and the mission of Project Bean there is to provide long-term assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| in order to improve the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| and expand opportunities for children living in orphanages in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| And in 2002, Tracy and Steve Foster traveled to Vietnam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| to adopt their first child, a baby girl, Lydia, from Hanoi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| The first of three adoptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| They returned in 2006 to adopt their son, Noah, from Da Nang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| and again in 2007 to adopt their youngest son, Aaron, from Phu To?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| Phu Ta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Phu Ta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Phu Ta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| And Tracy made connections with organizations working in Vietnam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| asking for her adoption group to become active participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| in facilitating changes at the orphanages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Tracy decided to form an organization dedicated to working towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| improving conditions for their orphanage children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| at St. Ann's Orphanage located in Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| Their long-term goals for facilitating change at St. Ann's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| is to improve educational support, proper care for special needs residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| maintaining a safe environment, improving health and nutrition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| and funding medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| And Project Bean there is a special group of people dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| to improving the lives of orphanage children in Vietnam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| one small victory at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Now they're for our mayor, Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| proclaim July 18, 2011 as Project Bean there today in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| And I want to tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| This lady, this really moved me, actually, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| my wife and I had a foster child, and that was something very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| But this lady has opened her house up to a group of wonderful children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| and I think she's made an impact all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| And it was just, it just brought some good attention, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| to Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| And she's an employee of this county, and I'm proud to work with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| If it would be all right, Mr. Chairman, if she could say a few words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| would that be all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| Here's your speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1054)|

| 0:17:36| I appreciate the recognition of Project Bean there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| It's a group effort, so couldn't have done it without my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| and the help of other families in our Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Without them, we wouldn't have made it to the NBC News.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So we're very thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:07| I'm reminded of a verse in the Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| how you treat the least amongst you is how you treat me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| And that was our Lord talking, so that was a pretty strong deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| And I think you've honored him and you've honored our great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1099)|

| 0:25:18| Commissioner Shouse. All members are present. Our devotional this morning will be led by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| Commissioner Amy Broyles, followed by the Pledge to the Flag by Commissioner Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Commissioner Broyles, you are recognized. Thank you. This has been kind of a rough weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| for lots of people that I know. The day after tomorrow is the third anniversary of the shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| that happened at our church, Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. In the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| recent issue of Metro Pulse, they had three very good articles relating to that. One was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| three congregation members who had wrote about their experiences three years ago were invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| to contribute their thoughts today. I wanted to share with you, of course you can read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:14| this in Metro Pulse, but I wanted to share with you the words of Diane Fox who is a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| of TVUC and she is a UT graphics design teacher who wrote three years ago, the children were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| adorable, doing an amazing job of putting on Annie Jr. They had worked so hard and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| is their moment. With an incredibly loud sound, everything changed. And someone shouted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| this is real. And today she says, on the day that a man walked into our church and began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| shooting, two things happened. I lost a good friend and I gained a sense of what it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| be like to live in fear. It has taken me these three years to move past my eyes, feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| with tears, each time I hear Greg McKendry's name and to regain a sense of comfort that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| I lost that day. When I thought I was going to die, I looked at my life and found it full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| of families, friends, students, a church community and a job that I love. It's a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| feeling and a lesson from that day I choose to hold. There is so much anger and division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| in the country and the world these days. The shooter was a consumer of books and radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| stations that seek to divide and separate people from one another. He saw and still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| sees us as a group of liberals the world would be better without. Within all religions, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| version of the golden rule, do unto others as you would wish them to do unto you exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| Unitarians have a creed that states we support the inherent worth and dignity of all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| In Christianity and Judaism, there is a belief that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| In the Buddhist religion, it states hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| hurtful. In Hinduism, one should not behave towards others in a way which is disagreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| to oneself. In Islam, none of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| for himself. My hope is that we can each get back to following that rule in our daily lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| in the way we treat others and in the decisions that we make and that we can begin to approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| each other with open hearts and minds. We have so much to learn if we just listen. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| think those are wonderful words that Diane wrote. I'm also going to share with you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| prayer that actually is credited to Mother Teresa and is actually on the wall in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:41| bedroom at her residence in Calcutta. It says, People are often unreasonable, irrational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| and self-centered. Forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| or ulterior motives. Be kind anyway. If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| friends and some genuine enemies. Succeed anyway. If you are honest and sincere, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| may deceive you. Be honest and sincere anyway. What you spend years creating, others could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| destroy overnight. Create anyway. If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| Be happy anyway. The good you do today will often be forgotten. Do good anyway. Give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| best you have and it will never be enough. Give your best anyway. In the final analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Let us stand and face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Next item is approval of the minutes of the previous meeting. Do I have a motion that we approve those minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| They are approved. Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| I have one quick and then I will get to Commissioner Brown. Item number R-11-7-903, I ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| that be deferred for 30 days. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, I would like to add resolution number R-11-7-913 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| This would be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Mr. Van Vick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page one, under item 2E, drives and roads, closure of Pleasant Ridge, if we could defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| We would like to do some additional study. Commissioner Norman had asked us to take another look and see if there were alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| We would like to go back out and do some additional field work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| There are a couple of sight distance issues around Rayland Lane that we would like to see if we could satisfactorily resolve those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Mr. Chairman, what was that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| It was under drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Bottom of page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| I'm sitting and trying to find it, but I don't know the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I would like the issue regarding the audits to be pulled as close to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Yes, do we have 901 on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| I believe it is on consent, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Can we pull that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Yes, 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| 911, is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Yes, 911 is on consent, but we'll have that pulled if that's your desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Are there any other amendments or changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| If not, do I hear a motion that we add what needed to be added and delete what needs to be deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1929)|

| 0:32:14| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1934)|

| 0:32:19| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I have a motion that they be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| 141, notaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Okay, it's a motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1945)|

| 0:32:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Next, we're going to have the appointment process for the 6th District State Senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| Mr. Law Director, I want to go over the procedure that's going to be used, and if I'm not exactly correct, please correct me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| We will go to each commission district, and each commissioner will have the opportunity to select an individual to be placed in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| Once these individuals have been placed in nomination, we will have the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| We will vote until one person receives six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| If after the first round someone has not received six votes, the person with the lowest vote total will be dropped off, and we will vote again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| and we will continue until one person receives the majority, which is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Mr. Law Director, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| That is the procedure you have consistently followed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Commissioner Oneby, did you have a question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Yes, we received an email on Tuesday from someone wanting to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| I know the deadline was Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| I don't know if the commission wants to recognize this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Auditor, according to our rules, that was just a suggestion that we have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| If anyone wanted to be considered, they can certainly be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| And this individual was, I believe, Angela Ogle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Your public notice that you publish reads that resumes should be submitted by July 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| but if the commission feels that it would be unfair to exclude this person, it can certainly entertain the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| We all have the application, and it's obviously the purview of the commissioners if they want to put that person's name in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| So we just, Angela Ogle, so we have noted the fact that we have received the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| Let's begin with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| And if anyone has a person to place a nomination, we will go through all 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| But we'll begin with the first commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| I guess I was, as I was listening to the candidates reviewing their resumes prior to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| this person is going to have to do some amount of legislating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| And I came up with a candidate, and then once we kind of interviewed the individuals I came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| and that candidate, in my opinion, stood out in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| And then, and I'll say unfortunately, because I didn't, and I try not to ever get into really partisan kind of politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=2093)|

| 0:52:36| and also Public Building Authority, and so I just wanted to make mention of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| that we did discuss this at great length during our luncheon today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| And, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| It was a very good discussion that Dr. Carcello had with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:58| and I think he was really clear about one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| and that's we need to give our internal auditor clear guidance on what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:16| why we're doing the audit, and just for the public's edification, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| he talked about if we needed to have things, is there an issue with theft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:32| Is there an issue with, you know, a mismanagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| And I think it came down to we're wanting an audit to deal with maybe some of the efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| and ensuring ourselves that funds were managed to the best of their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:54| So, you know, someone please correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| or if I've boiled this down too succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| With that said, I think there was, again, a clear understanding that this shouldn't be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| You know, and then we started talking a lot about where this came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| and I'm just going to kind of be honest, it did fall out of the budgetary process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| but I think it came initially from a blog that had the 990 back, 990 form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:31| That was, and they all admit, I think as long as the day long, was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| There was an error in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| I actually am the first person to make them aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| I had a conversation with the mayor and the chief of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| and they made me aware that this 990 looked a little suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| And so I took that information to the executive director, and I'll say he immediately got on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| Our little five-minute, well, 15-minute conversation yielded some uncertainty as to why it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| and I think they immediately got on it and contacted their accounting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| They tried to understand how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| And I keep saying the Beck situation was extremely complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| There were employees that weren't going to be employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| they were going to make them employees for another year, they were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Memorandum says that they still should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| So there was a lot of back and forth on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| So a mistake, but an honest mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| And that document was a day after I was shown the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| was, I guess, leaked via a blog, and the rest is kind of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| So, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| A mistake was made on that 990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I don't claim to take up for them in any way, shape, form, or fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| but getting back to the point of why we're doing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| So I think that needs to be clearly vetted out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| What are we asking Richard to do for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| We kind of gave an indication that you've got a pretty tight deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| so the clearer we can be with our internal auditor as to what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| I think the better result we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| And, again, I think at the end of the day, I know at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| I know for a fact at the end of the day, the county's monies were well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| It can be documented in details on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| So, again, hopefully we'll discuss that and we'll be able to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| Again, Beck took a severe cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| and they need to get on about the business of raising the monies the way we instructed them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| the way people feel that they should via private donors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| So this is a transition for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Let's let them get on with that with what I know will be a seal of approval from this audit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| But if it's not, they'll have to deal with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So hopefully we can, again, give that information in the coming minutes of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:27| On page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Approving a fund balanced as a national general purpose school fund in the amount of $2,940,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| for the purchase of mathematics textbooks for the 2011-12 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Commissioner Orwendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| Yeah, the reason I had questions about this and I made it known last Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| and I talked to Dr. McIntyre last Thursday about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| and I voiced my concern is that our school system is moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| and he's had the innovation since he's been hired to look to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| And I told him that I question spending the $3 million out of their fund balance this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:31| in looking at innovation to what South Korea is already doing with their children in their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| which is iPads and Kindles, where you can order, download the books a lot cheaper to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| The cost up front is a little bit, but in the long run it's going to save us a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| He doesn't feel we're there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| He sees that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| He agrees with me that we're headed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I just think that we can get there a little sooner than four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| So that's the reason I oppose spending this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| I'd rather reinvest this in a couple of years into Kindles or Nooks or iPads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| something of that nature, because that's where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Colleges are already doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| So I just think that's a cheaper way in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| So that's the reason I oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Commissioner Wembe votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Also on page four, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| approving a proposal of the Tennessee Department of Transportation to construct a proposed designated as number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| STP331647162-2211-14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| that is described as intersection improvements SR331 Tassel Pike and SR131 Emory Road, resolution 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3593)|
| 1:00:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| I appreciate commissioners allowing this to be removed from the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| It's not really about the resolutions before us because it only speaks of what the county is going to do for the state once this project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:22| In other words, the county is going to take care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| The state goes out there and puts in places as a part of the traffic control at Tassel Pike and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| In the 8th district, this is a question I get asked most often, is when is there going to be traffic signalization at that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| And that's something I wanted to give Dwight an opportunity to speak to if there's something along the timeline that he could speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Mr. Chairman, Dwight Vendavate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Commissioner Wright, the state is going to begin right-of-way acquisition in fall of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| They'll go to construction in spring of 2012, and they hope to complete construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| and have the improvements open in the fall of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| They're adding turn lanes on all approaches, signalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and they're smoothing some of the elevation on the Emory Road portion of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Then I do want to ask a difficult question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| The second most asked question I get in the 8th district is getting off 640 onto Millertown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| going through the small two-lane bridge at the foot of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Has there been any progress with the city about what could be done there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| It is in their capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| I don't know their construction timelines, but it is absolutely in their capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| They plan at that two-lane bottleneck, bottlenecks back down to two-lane in front of the Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| They're going to take that from three lanes out to three lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| all the way across to the Joe McMillan Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| The motion is to approve. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Any opposition? It is approved. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3727)|

| 1:02:19| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3742)|

| 1:02:28| 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Yes, 501. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| There is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3753)|

| 1:04:02| This is Resolution 503.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| Yes, I would like to, and I may need the law director's guidance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| All of these are lumped together, and I have some grave concerns about one of the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| and I would like to pull it out and do it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Is there some way that we can pull one contract out and approve the remainder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| and spend some time on this one and either postpone it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| I mean, this is your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| I think they were listed in group for your convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| but if there's one that gives you pause, you certainly have every right to extract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Do I need to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| I would make it a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| That would be the easiest, cleanest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| I would make a substitute motion that we approve all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| except for the contract dealing with the Hope Resource Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| and that we do some conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Motion has been made to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| I just want to make sure that we get the wording right on the high school volunteer fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Larry, did they fold and rural metro took over or is the high school still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| It's still in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Commissioner Burroughs, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So the substitute motion is that we vote on all except for the Hope Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| So, Mr. Law Director, if we vote in the affirmative, everything is approved but Hope Resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| and we go back and have discussion on that, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Commissioner Burroughs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Commissioner Ornby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| I'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Commissioner Shouse, that's aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:34| The vote is five yes, six no, so the substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| Back to the original motion, that is, that they all be considered together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Now then, Mr. Chairman, I would assume that the vote previously taken may have failed because of no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:52| I need to hear the discussion of what's before us before we vote on the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| Well, that was why I made the substitute motion was to go ahead and approve the rest of these that no one has a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| and just spend our time talking about this one, but we can do it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| It's just that I know that I personally cannot vote in favor of this resolution because of the concerns that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| but I would like to go ahead and support all of these other organizations' contracts because I think they make a great deal of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| So that was the basis for making that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| But we can do it all in a lump package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| That is the motion before us is that we vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| So any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Are we not going to have discussion about the HOPE Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| I have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| This contract has been a, I've had a little concern or a great deal of concern about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:53| Last year and this previous year, the HOPE Resource Center applied for grants through the community grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4073)|
| 1:08:02| And for both years, the panelists who were, we asked for volunteers from the community and they put in a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:11| and they decided both last year and this year that HOPE Resource Center was not a good use of taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| and they refused to include them in the list of grantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| I agree with their assessment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| I brought my concerns up at the budget meeting and was told that the contract was only for hepatitis screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:43| But the contract that's come to us is back to the original one that they sent before the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| which was pregnancy testing, STD testing, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| Our health department already does the majority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| So basically what we're doing is paying two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| We're paying to duplicate our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| So I don't think that those are, I don't think that's appropriate since we already provide funding for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| through the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| The other concern that I have is that this organization does a lot of things that I think very highly of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:30| Their teen pregnancy, parenting classes, all of that I support wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| What I do have a problem with is being in social services years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| I got a lot of complaints from young women who felt like they were bullied and harassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| when they went to that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| In fact, I have someone who is willing to, who is agreeable to possibly doing a sworn statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:04| if necessary, about her experiences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| This is a group that is very, very, very anti-abortion, which I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| What I do have a problem with is how the young women who seek help here, how they're being treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| And I feel like for an organization that is pushing a political ideology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:36| that we don't need to be giving them taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| I know that if we were talking about giving $8,000 to Planned Parenthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| even though they do provide free pregnancy testing and STD testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| there is a majority of people up here who would be opposed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| because they would claim that the political ideology of that organization should exempt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| And I think if we're going to apply it in that situation, we need to apply it in this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| I don't think that this is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| If someone wants to give personal funds, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| But I don't think this is appropriate for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| I also think that, you know, during the luncheon just a little while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| we sat in there and talked about how, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| we don't want to spend money on an outside auditor for these audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| because, you know, it's just too much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| We need to save where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| But it's going to be okay to give $8,000 to an organization who's duplicating services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| that Knox County is already paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| I just don't approve of that, and I will not vote to fund this organization for those two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:58| The fact that they're duplicating services that we already pay for should be reason enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| But secondly, I don't want to give taxpayer dollars to an organization who is promoting a political ideology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:13| and I would not vote to give funds to Planned Parenthood either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| I just don't think that's what we need to be doing with the taxpayer's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| I want to hear from the health department, because, I mean, that is exactly what we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| that this was strictly for the hepatitis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| That's why I supported it, that, you know, to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I don't want to get into the political aspect, that they can have that arm and, okay, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| But these funds, these public dollars were supposed to go for a screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| I think Dr. Buchanan said that this screening was not done by the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| this type of hepatitis since you detail what we do, you know, a screen for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| That's what these funds were for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Do we have the wrong contract in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Could you give me some detail as to why this change, this apparent change is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Mark Miller, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| We don't do hepatitis B testing, as my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| As far as some of the other STD testing, of course, we do that as part of our public health role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| So but this contract, can you speak to this contract that we're about to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| Does that specifically say that these dollars go for hepatitis tests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| I think that's what we had asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| So that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| I have the contract in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Could you comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Could you comment, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| This is what's attached to your agenda, these following services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Pregnancy testing and proof of pregnancy, first trimester ultrasound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| medical consultations and education with patients, STD testing and referrals for male and female,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| HIV oral screening, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, hepatitis B and C, herpes culture, wet prep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| may have to defer to Dr. Briggs on that, bacterial vaginosis and DOL, yeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| I believe the term is TRICH, T-R-I-C-H, TRICH?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| TRICH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| TRICH, thank you, and visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| General warts type HPV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| That's what your contract reads that's attached to AgendaQuick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| This is way more than what was reported that we were going to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| I mean, as he's clearly stated, what we said we would support was the screenings that the county does not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| And I think I asked the question, these funds are going to explicitly go for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| So if that's the case, I think we need to, well, I think at that point, I think it's part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| I think you all clearly said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| So this contract is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I will turn to the law director, we can review the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| What was said in the budgetary process is that clearly, hepatitis, because we don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| So either we'll need to amend this contract, I don't know if we can do that real time here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| or we'll need to have another one brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I think it's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| The other thing, too, is the health department does not certify pregnancy tests for Medicaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| or Medicare that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| But again, in the discussion for why we're going to give these funds, out of the hotel-motel tax, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| that's where we are, out of whatever funds, out of general funds, it was clearly said in the budgetary process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:48| this is for hepatitis, I think B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| I think it was hepatitis B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| B and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Again, we can review the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| I thought Michelle said that we screen for C, but we don't screen for B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| That one I'm not sure of, but if it's B and C, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| But it needs to say that and we get rid of all this other stuff, because that's what we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| That's what was clearly explained to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Mr. Murray, I don't know if you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| I was just going to say, those are the things that Knox County does not screen for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| but these are some additional things that they do screen for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| And it's basically we're getting more for our buck than we really asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| I mean, if you want to scale it back, that's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| But if you've got a young person in there who's in a little bit of trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I don't see any problem with them testing for gonorrhea or syphilis or chlamydia or any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| Well, I guess I do, especially with the pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Again, let's not make this political, because we know this is an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| I'm not talking about you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| But we know this is an organization that pushes one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| And I'm fine with them pushing one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| And I really am fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| I'll be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| But what was said to us, because I think it was Commissioner Brawls brought up the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| you know, they're talking people out of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| And that's okay on your own dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| But if we've got a positive pregnancy test, we've got a positive pregnancy test with a venereal disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| I think the other arm of your organization will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| So again, that's why I want it to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| And we can say no here, but we're not in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Again, what the public dollars should fund should be apolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| It should be apolitical either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So that's why I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| We'll do the hepatitis funds, but we're including all these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| You're getting into gray areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| Like I don't know if Commissioner Brawls has someone she could bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| This person might not be telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| You don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| You know, when it gets behind the closed door and the confidence of doctors or these practitioners' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| that's one thing that I don't think we need to delve into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| I think it's important that if a young lady were to come in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| and test positive for a communicable disease that could be passed on to her child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| that she be made aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| But we shouldn't fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| We should not fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Or if we're funding it, it's through something that we control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| This organization does not report to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| You, the mayor, are held accountable with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| If something's done wrong, you're going to be there and ensure that, hey, this is not how we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| This is a private entity that we're giving a grant to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| And just like these other ones, this memorandum of understanding, which I agree with, I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Let's have a clear, that's what we said, we want a clear guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| These are the jobs that we're giving you this grant to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| So in that same vein, let's give them clear guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| We want hepatitis and hepatitis alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| And those funds, that's what we said we would vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| My name is Lisa Hardin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| I'm the executive director for Hope Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| And this is my first time before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| So thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Some of you have toured our facility, Hope Resource Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| and I thank you for those of you who have taken the time to come and see our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| And I encourage any of you, I would love to give you a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4772)|

| 1:19:38| We are not aligned with any political group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| And the services we provide are unconditional, non-threatening, non-judgmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| doesn't matter your background, we will not discriminate against anyone coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| Our medical services, the $8,000, we have a $300,000 medical budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| And out of that $8,000, it was medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| It's not volunteers who offer any kind of counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| It is strictly for our nurses, our nurse practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| It's for ours to do these testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| And I will say it's very important and an asset that the POP, this proof of pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| that Hope Resource Center provides to people who are faced with an unplanned pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| or it doesn't matter, anyone that can come in and get a proof of pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| you take that to the health department and you are able to be enrolled in TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| And we provide this service totally for free, everything we do for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| And it doesn't matter what your background is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| We are very much concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| We want to partner with you to make a difference in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| and be very, very concerned about those who possibly are in a risky behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| and may have a sexually transmitted disease, and we want to be there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| Commissioner Broyles, your concern, that's where I was headed to with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| I appreciate your looking back and making sure that we do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| what we said we wanted to do a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| And if this contract's not correct, you said it wasn't so much about the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| it's what they're going to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| No, it's also about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| That was my question, is if they provide a service for $8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| I just wanted to make sure we got in the line of what you wanted to see them perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| Mr. Mary, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I think the question needs to be, to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| which of these services do you not want this mother or this unborn child to receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| I guess that would be the final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Actually, that's actually not the appropriate question for us to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| The appropriate question for us to answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| what did we agree to two months ago during the budget hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| Also, I can say that there are at least half a dozen places in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| where you can get a free or a low-cost pregnancy test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| And there are other ways of getting the POP that we need to get these people on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| And anywhere you go and get these pregnancy tests, you get screened for all of these, except for the HEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| And the reason is, Mr. Mayor, is that because I went to Dr. Buchanan and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| educate me on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| The health department doesn't screen for HEP B because they don't consider it a wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| or effective use of taxpayer dollars because the prevalence is so low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and because it's transmitted not as readily as the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| Now, I can also say that, and these are two things, Mayor Burchett, that I've heard you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| One is that, and this is when we were actually discussing this issue in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| when I said that I had concerns about expenditure of these funds going for anything at this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:30| And you pointed out to me that it was only for the hepatitis screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| And I said, yes, but if you free up funds that they would have spent on that, they can pour it into their counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| And you said, well, that's the same argument that we use when we try to keep Planned Parenthood from getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| We don't give Planned Parenthood money because it drains their resources so they don't have extra money to put into their family planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| I'd like to correct you on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Planned Parenthood, I believe, charges for their services, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Well, I said that I didn't mention Planned Parenthood specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| I said they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| You said I did, and then you just did right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| No, well, what I was quoting you on, Mr. Burchett, was in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| and you said that you made the same argument about Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| You've also said publicly that if you can find it in the phone book, we shouldn't be paying for it, or we shouldn't be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| Well, there are, like I said, there's half a dozen places in town where you can either get this free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| or at very low cost on a sliding fee scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| So I just, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| This is just, if people want to support this organization, they should make private contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| but it's not appropriate for taxpayer dollars, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| our own citizen review panels have declined for the last two years to provide any funding for this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| because they didn't think it was a good use of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Did you serve on that funding panel last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| The first year I did, but this didn't even come up for a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| because they didn't even make it through the initial screening process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| At that point, I did not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, they did, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| If you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| You're making a lot of statements, and I hear the press is writing all this down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and I'm sure, you know, if you want to make your statements one at a time and we can go over each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Ongoing debate is really unnecessary as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| If you want to address concerns about the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| this young lady who's brave enough to come up here and try not to be berated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| I would appreciate if you would direct her questions to her individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| If I have a question about how the organization does their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| I'll be more than happy to speak with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Ma'am, you've made several statements, though, concerning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| and I'm afraid that some of them are in error, and if you want to make derogatory statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| I think it would be diplomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I'm not making derogatory statements, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| It would be diplomatic of you to allow her to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| I'm talking to you right now about funding using taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| and what is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| and I have quoted two statements that you've made that I think relate to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| We just had a conversation in the other room about spending taxpayer dollars needlessly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| where we are duplicating services that we're already paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| We don't do the testing for the hepatitis or the herpes culture and the, what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:38| Hepatitis B and C, apparently, according to the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| In herpes testing, you can get in a lot of places around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| Ma'am, but you make these statements, and unfortunately, I think you need to back them up with facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:56| I mean, it's easy to make these statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| If you want to ask the lady a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| But, Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we could keep the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| relevant to what we're talking about, and I just don't think the attacks are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:13| Mr. Mayor, I'm really sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I don't feel like I'm attacking anyone or making derogatory statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| I don't have questions about how the organization is run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| What I have a question about is how we're spending our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Ma'am, you said they bullied people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| I believe, if you want to quote me, I'll quote you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| You said they bullied people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| I believe that could be termed as a derogatory statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| That's your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Well, it's not my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| This is what has been reported to me from the young girls that I've worked with over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| You said, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| You said it had been reported to you by who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| By young girls that I've worked with over the years who have come to me because of treatment that they've received at this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| They felt like they had been pressured and harassed and bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| This is not just one young woman who has brought this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| And, again, the bottom line also should be this is not what we approved when we approved the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| This is absolutely not what we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| It's been tremendously expanded since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| Folks, I believe that we have made our points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| If we could, I think we're ready to proceed to a vote, but I want to get these other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| Do you have anything else, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| I just want to reiterate that we are already paying money through our health department for these services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| and so we're actually essentially duplicating services that we're already paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| We have talked already this morning about spending money needlessly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:59| and this contract that is before us today is not the same thing that was before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| when we approved it as part of the budget two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| So those are my concerns and points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I wanted to stay out of this because I just didn't want it to get very negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| You know, there's a few organizations on here, Amy, that we're giving money to that do things that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| And us giving money to them frees up money to do those things that I don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| But they are in the phone book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| They are things that the county is helping underprivileged people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| And these two organizations have, if you put a political slant on them, they're totally opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:51| But I'm not going to sit here and vote against something because of a few things it does that I totally disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| to hamper the ability for a lady to get prenatal care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| And so sometimes the good outweighs the negative a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and you've just got to swallow your pride and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| And that's what I'm going to do when I vote for this because there's an organization here that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| I don't think we should send them a nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| because they provide prenatal care to women that otherwise couldn't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| But it's in the yellow pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| And so I think it's, you know, when you talk about being against something or for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| sometimes the positive outweighs the negative and you've just got to do what's best for the overall community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| and not your political views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| And I think that's what we have to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| First of all, I'd like to acknowledge Ms. Rawls being the only woman on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| and we're discussing an item that's intimate to womanhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| And so she has a perspective that we probably can't exactly understand or experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:09| So I guess my question, and I'll direct it through the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| is the citizen review panel process which denied funding for the resource center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:26| I guess I would like the lady that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| I'm sorry, I didn't get your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Lisa, would you come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| So in the citizen review panel process where the center was declined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| could you talk about that process, what happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| Actually, our organization, we went to the meeting and we presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| And later when we found out that we were not receiving the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| we were told it's because there had been a cut in the amount of dollars that were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| And the organizations, you know, there may have been ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| I'm sorry, I don't know the number of the organizations that received the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| but we actually fell just right below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| That was the explanation that we were given as to why we were not receiving funds this year from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Were there any other items in the application process that were negative towards what you do or how you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| We sat before the review panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| They were wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| They asked us questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| They had no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| There were no red flags in our application whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| Ms. Boyle has had some statements about some negativity from people that attended your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:56| And so I'm sure you're aware of some of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| So how do you feel about, I mean, how do you handle or review situations where there is negativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:08| or there's something that's going on that maybe you don't intend, but it does create a tension or stress level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| I just wanted to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| We're not in a topia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| It's not a perfect place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| There's no perfect place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| I have to say that I have not personally had anyone leave upset that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| You know, whatever a young, I mean, our whole role is to inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| We want them to be, our young men and women to be equipped to make the decision that is for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| They're the ones ultimately that make their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| We just want them to be equipped with truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| We don't have to course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| We don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| We give truthful information and a lot of our medical or all our medical information is provided by nurse practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| or RNs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| We're overseen by a medical board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| So everything that we give, we give truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| And that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| I mean, there is nothing that we're trying to do as far as we have no hidden agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| It is basically to love every single person who comes through our door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| Yes, we're a faith-based organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| I'm not going to hide behind anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| That is truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| But what we do is to be able just to give them truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| They're equipped to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| And when they walk out the door, that they've just been loved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| Every person, no matter what they say to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| That is the ultimate goal of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| It's well-known, widely known for anybody that's associated with HOPE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| that this is a Christian organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| There's a Christian theology behind your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| Faith-based, just like CARM and any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| A lot of ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| And why you do what you do and why I feel really led to be a part of an organization like this is because of my faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| But it's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| And I serve because I want to be a faithful and obedient person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| But what I experience and what is going on with me doesn't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| it's not what I want somebody to model that and have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| I share my testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| I share my faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| If someone's not interested and all they want is an STD test, that's what they're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| So the political aspect of it, I think, gets hooked in and meshed, of course, with maybe faith-based issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:44| And it's really sad that we have got to a point in this society where we have pulled politics into the value of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:56| There's no place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| We're not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| We're not aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| We just want to, like I say, just want to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| We don't protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| We don't get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| This is the most political that I've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| So, you know, as far as politics are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| I'd like the gentleman from the health department to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| You know, let me just be totally clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| I am a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| I love the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Jesus died for my sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| I mean, you know, but when I'm sitting here in the legislative body, when we're talking about there's a separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| We're talking about public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| Not everybody believes like I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Not everybody believes like you believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| That's why we have to separate these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| And again, the bottom line issue, and I'm going to ask this gentleman here because I'm pretty sure he was in the room at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| When we debated Hope Resource Center, was it said that the county dollars would solely go for hepatitis B and C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:10| I wasn't present during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| You were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Have you called Michelle, Dr. Buchanan, and gotten that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Because I clearly remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Is there any way to get that information to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Because if that's the case, this whole debate is pointless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| And I guess I would turn to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| I don't know if we have to do a minute review if we can't get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Maybe I'll ask the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Maybe we can delay this while we get that information from the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| But if that's what was said, that's what deflated this whole debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| This whole thing got deflated because we said, look, we're talking about hepatitis B and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| And that's all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| This contract says different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| So this MOU says differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Let's not make this about pro-life, pro-choice, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Let's stay out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| You do your ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| And please do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| But we're talking about these county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| They should go for those two tests and those two tests alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| End of story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Or we should have debated it at the time before we passed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| So that's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| I don't know what to do, Mr. Law Director, at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| There's some unreadiness or some uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| I think we all do remember the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| So maybe not all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| I don't know how we would get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Well, sir, the only person who would have accurate information would be the clerk in their minutes or archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| I certainly couldn't accurately do it by rote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Mr. Chair, I don't know at this point if we could ask for a delay in this while we do that research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| We have a motion on the floor if you want to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| I don't think we legally can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| No, we can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| We've had a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Well, you're still in the perfecting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| So, ostensibly, you can make another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| As long as it's a different substitute, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| But it can't, of course, be a mirror image of the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| That's your dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| So you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| I'm just saying that that procedurally would be something you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Or we could just all agree that we want to just put this at the end of the agenda and address it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| Or we could vote on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| What is the will of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| I think folks know my will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| And then my whole point, let's get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| Let's get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| You're getting things all confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| You know, you're talking about they were turned down by the grant review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| When those grant review committee gets those lists of agencies, like somebody mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:05| there's X amount of dollars, and like Lisa mentioned, they go down the list until they run out of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| You may be down on a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| That doesn't mean it's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| That doesn't mean it's rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| That just means we didn't have enough money to go that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| That's all that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| That doesn't mean it's a bad program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| I've been down to Hope Center and spent some time down there with the ladies and watched what they do down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:33| They do great work down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| And I know that this is a sticking point with Sam and this, that, you know, it's got to be black or white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| In this case, it's got to be we did this and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| So in order to put it to bed, we spent a bigger part of an hour on this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:55| Can we make a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| That we adopt this, leaving out the Hope Resource Center to be revisited next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| Does the maker of the motion and the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| That's the same motion and I wouldn't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| We've already voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| We've already voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| So can't do a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Well, then I'll make a motion that we delay all of them for a month then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| The substitute motion then is to delay everything for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| And there is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| Commissioner Briggs, then I'll get to Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| You know, I think we need to try to work for a way to come out of this impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| And I think that some of the points that Amy's made have been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| I think some of the points that Sam has made have been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| But I also think some of the points that the mayor has made are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| We do have some duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| We do have some services that can be provided only by the Hope Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| because they're really effectively almost a sole source provider on this as far as the hepatitis testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| and getting a certification of pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Would there be any way that we could modify the contract or do it even through action of this commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| where we, and I can understand, I obviously have never had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| I'm trying to think of a proper way to say this, a female examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| But if I were a young teenager, I may not want to go through two or three of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| You know, in other words, get one thing down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| And I can understand why if a young teenager is down there and they're having to do an exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| and then they see they want to do a wet smear, they may want to do some cultures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| they may want to do some other things, she gets one exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Yeah, it is a duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| But let's just get those all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| But could we put a restriction in the contract that it will just be testing that's done and not any counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| and then they can return to the health department, they get their certification so they can get on TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| so both the mother and the child can get their proper prenatal care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| And since there is some concern about any counseling going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| you're saying that none of these funds can be used for counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| and any of the patients that are referred by the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| are to be sent back to the health department after the appropriate testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Even though I agree that there is some duplication of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| at least a young teenager only gets one exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| and there will not be counseling done at the Hope Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| and that can all be done back at the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| or once she gets her TennCare with her private physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| Would that be proper or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| And that might, I don't know if that's acceptable or not, but that might get us out of this impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| Well, we've already got a substitute motion on the floor that I think we have to work through first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| Substitute motion is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Mike made one and I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| The current motion on the floor is to delay all contracts for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| That's currently on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| It's been duly made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| If we were to vote that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Then you're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| You could offer a friendly amendment, I believe, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| For any patients referred to the Hope Center, no counseling will be done on those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| The testing can be done and then they're sent back to the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| or once they get their TennCare card, they can go to their private physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| So, Mr. Law Director, would that be a proper friendly amendment to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Should?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| Well, first of all, we have a written contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| And a contract is basically a legal document that's formulated by mutual assent of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| If the other party doesn't agree to those terms, then you have a unilateral contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| So, first of all, you need to articulate the changes you're making to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| You can make an oral amendment to a written contract if both parties assent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| So, the representative for the Hope Center would have to agree to those terms and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| And then if she does, then you can pass it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Well, let's hold off on that until we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Maybe I moved it. Do you have anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Okay. Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| And I will say, I didn't get a chance to respond to some of Brad's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| but if there's an organization on this list that you have problems with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| I would hope that you would bring it up and discuss it in commission or vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| I mean, I think that's our right and responsibility as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| So, I wouldn't have any problem at all with you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| I also, to Dr. Briggs' credit, and Tony obviously was absolutely right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| I'm the only woman sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| I've had babies and pregnancies and been to the doctor and all that good stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| and I can tell you, your heart is in the right place to try to keep these teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| from having to have so many exams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| But I can tell you, your first, even if you get your pregnancy diagnosed somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| your first visit for your first prenatal care, you're going to get a pelvic exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| and you're going to get a pap smear, which is not included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| You're going to get tested for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Now, a pregnancy test is not an invasive test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:06| You pee in a cup, you dip a stick in it, and you wait to see if there's a plus or a minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| So, nobody is sitting with their feet up in stirrups getting a pregnancy test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| and, oh, let's go ahead and do all this with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| That's not how pregnancy tests are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| And when, like I said, your first appointment with your obstetrician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| you're going to get a pelvic exam, you're going to get all of this testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| and you're also going to get a pap smear, which is not included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| So, I don't think, I mean, I understand where you're coming from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| and I think your motivation was right, but that doesn't solve what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| Let me just say, but we still have this issue of getting the hepatitis, you know, the hepatitis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| And I'd also like to say that, you know, not approving this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| is not depriving anybody of prenatal care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| That's an illogical jump that's been made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:08| And they can still, you know, if we're not paying for the STD testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| and the pregnancy testing and all that, which, by the way, we already pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| through our health department, then they can spend their own funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| that they raise privately to do that testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| They're not going to stop doing that testing if they've obviously been doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| for two years without any funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| And as far as the grants panel goes, you rank those organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| in the order that you consider their programs effective, necessary, worthy of public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| And, yes, there was less funding this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| There was less funding last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| But they didn't even make it up into that bracket high enough to get any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| So it's not that they're bad or they don't do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| It's our panelists did not feel like they scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| They just didn't score high enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| If they had scored high enough, they would have gotten some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| We need to vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| I'm sorry, this is a very personal issue for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| But I think he's out of order with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| She had the floor, so she has to relinquish the floor before we can call for the point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| And, yes, we do not provide HEP testing, and I asked Dr. Buchanan about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| and she gave me some really good reasons why we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Again, regardless of where we all fall on this ideology about, you know, anti-choice, anti-abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:46| whatever side of this you're on, the bottom line is that we're already paying for these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| And this is a group who just spent a great deal of time talking about not wasting taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:59| We had a contract that we based a previous vote on, and this is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:08| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just one quickly before you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| I believe Commissioner Briggs was concerned about the monies being used for counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| The express terms of the contract read that monies will not be used for counseling, but merely for these testings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6556)|
| 1:49:24| That's the express terms as it reads currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| It says all services will be provided, and then it further reads that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| and will not be used for counseling, which is handled by volunteer services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Well, I guess since a lot of the services down there are free and some of the concerns that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| that they've been talked about, I'd almost, you know, if it gets us out of this impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| just to say that the patients that are referred there will not be counseled rather than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| because, I mean, you could say they're going to counsel them for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| I could say that, but that gets us out of the impasse where the health department can still send people down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| and get the testing done that's, you know, that they can't do in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| In particular, I'm talking about hepatitis and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| and also get their certificate, certification of pregnancy so they can get on TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| because the quicker these people get on TennCare, the quicker they can start getting their prenatal care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| because a lot of that other prenatal care is not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I have a question I'd like to ask Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| This is in regards to the substitute motion on the 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| When do the checks, if you could give us your name and address of the record first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| John Troyer, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| When do the checks go out for these organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| If we wait until August to take any action on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| are these people going to be waiting on their funding until September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| So what is the time frame on writing checks to, like, the rescue squad and the fire departments and all of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| Yeah, we'll wait until they're approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| So if we approve them now, the checks can start going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| Otherwise, they probably won't get checks until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Okay, I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Yes, again, I would like to reiterate, this is not prenatal care that they're getting when they come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| So nobody is being denied prenatal care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| No, but they can't get prenatal care until they get their certificate and start getting on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| Well, there are more than one way, there is more than one place that will do the free pregnancy testing and do all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| I also want to point out that when we talk about the, we're not stopping anything that they do from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:46| We are just keeping taxpayer dollars out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| And we've specified no counseling, but in their contract, it reads that they will provide medical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6710)|
| 1:52:00| Yes, but see, medical education can also be used to pressure these women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:10| And I just, aside from whether or not you think what they do is okay, this is not appropriate for us to do for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:20| One is that we're paying for the same service twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| and this is not the contract that we were assured we were going to have two months ago when we did the budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:32| So those two things alone, especially considering the comments that I've heard from all of the commissioners up here about wasting taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:42| You know, guys, this is, and yes, as the only woman up here, this is an issue that is very, very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:54| Motion on the floor is to delay for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I think the noes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| So we're back to the original motion, that is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| I'm sorry, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| I want to go back to my original statement, and that is I do not think we can approve these things that's in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:30| I think in the budgetary process, Dr. Buchanan told us certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| Again, regardless of where you fall on these issues, we voted on that because it was an if-then process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:45| If you only are doing things that the county does not do, i.e., hepatitis B and C, then we cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:53| So I do not think it is appropriate or legal for us to vote on this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| Again, that's my sole point to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| The budget process is supposed to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| We ask and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| If we're voting on something that we did not agree to in the budget process, then that needs to be clearly spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| And right now there's some uncertainty, I guess in some people's minds, not in mine, of how that conversation went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:26| And I don't know if the gentleman was able to get Dr. Buchanan in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| So, or Grant, I don't know where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| It was actually Grant that made the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Regardless of how it came to be, that's what we voted on, and that's what made it go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| So, again, I'll ask the, you know, we can vote on this, but we need to find out whether that is proper or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:54| And I don't know how best to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| So I'll look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| If something, if we voted on a bait and switch, I'm generalizing, don't be sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| but if we're voting on something that is more, greater than the scope that we approved in the budget, what do we do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| If this passes, comes to find out that, yes, hepatitis B and C were the only things that were supposed to be done, what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:20| Well, you have several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| You can certainly amend the contract by mutual assent of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| You know, the problem you have is trying to get an accurate record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| The clerks will need specifics because their minutes are cryptic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| So if you're looking for actual verbatim conversation, they could possibly pull a CD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| but that's not something they can just pull up, you know, with a quick phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| That's going to take some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| So it may be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| Yeah, we go to CTV as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Right, but again, you'd have to get the disc, have somebody review the disc, find the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| That's what I'm just trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| But I guess does it really matter what was said because the only thing that matters is what's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| I mean, it may matter to us, I mean, you know, with this, you know, the repartee that's going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| but the only thing that really matters, the only thing that's going to happen is what's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| I think that's correct, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Well, you're bound by the, you know, a court won't go beyond the four rules of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| And if you entered into this contract knowingly and intelligently in its mutual assent to the parties, it's a legal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| I mean, even if somebody said something else, this gets back to the Solway argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| If somebody told us we could do this, but there was nothing written down, you know, it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| I mean, what we're dealing with, as you all are right, what we're dealing with is what's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| So we need to vote on the contract, not on something that was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| I'm sort of arguing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| But, you know, I don't disagree with you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| I think you're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| But I'll say that that's the poor way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| We should not have a budgetary process to have people come up here and tell us exactly how they're going to spend money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| and then we come up with a contract that says we're going to spend it times about five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| I just think that's a very poor practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| If not illegal, it is very unethical, extremely unethical if the director of a department has come up here and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:21| that we're going to only do the public monies for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| And I think we all know that that was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| If that happens and we come up with a contract that adds additional scope, that's not, I think that is an unethical practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:39| So the votes will go how they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| But I will do that research between now and next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| There's not much more I can say than what has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| And Sam, you know, makes excellent points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| This is a bad way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| I knew coming in here that I was probably not going to be able to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| But I felt like it was my responsibility to at least raise the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| And I can tell you guys that after hearing over the last couple of months about wasteful spending and taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:24| and, you know, what it's boiling down to is we're going to overlook that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:34| We're going to overlook that in certain cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| And I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| You can't have your cake and eat it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| I just don't think that this is an appropriate expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| It's duplicating services that we already pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| The contract is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| It was at the budget meeting, and I brought HOPE Resource Center up and wanted to discuss it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7134)|
| 1:59:00| Grant Rosenberg stood up and said the contract will only be for hepatitis testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:08| And so at that point there was no further discussion because the issue was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| So now two months later the contract comes in with a whole heck of a lot more on it than just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:22| And, again, the fact that wasteful spending is only a problem or is not a problem in certain circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:31| then that speaks volumes, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Our willingness to approve a contract that has changed substantially since the budget hearing, that speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:48| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| Could we have a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Commissioner McKenzie votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Commissioner Brolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Commissioner Brolls votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Commissioner Norman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Commissioner Ornby votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Commissioner Briggs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part1?start=7213)|
