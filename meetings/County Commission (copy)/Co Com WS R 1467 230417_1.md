| 2:18:13| Some rural counties don't have that capability, and they do defer to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8293.720000000001)|
| 2:18:18| And I think if you would ask home builders in those jurisdictions, the services we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8298.720000000001)|
| 2:18:22| are much, much greater than what the state would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8302.720000000001)|

| 2:19:12| CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8352.48)|
| 2:19:15| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8355.48)|
| 2:19:18| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8358.48)|
| 2:19:23| Motion to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8363.24)|
| 2:19:26| with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8366.24)|
| 2:19:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8368.24)|
| 2:19:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8369.24)|
| 2:19:33| I think Mr. Caldwell, I've got a couple questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8373.24)|
| 2:19:39| And I'd ask to have this pulled off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8379.24)|
| 2:19:51| Mr. Caldwell, when I read the resolution, I was a little bit concerned because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8391.0)|
| 2:19:58| year that the two and a half million dollars was, and of course the way it's listed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8398.0)|
| 2:20:05| here, that the trustee authorized payment to go to the Knoxville-Knox County Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8405.0)|
| 2:20:12| Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8412.0)|
| 2:20:15| My initial concern was of who was running the department in 2008 at the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8415.76)|
| 2:20:22| And so that's why I was concerned that was this a loan to CAC and was there a repayment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8422.76)|
| 2:20:31| schedule at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8431.76)|
| 2:20:35| So at that time there was not a repayment schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8435.76)|
| 2:20:39| It was a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8439.52)|
| 2:20:41| We refer to it as an advance just from an accounting standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8441.52)|
| 2:20:45| And the amount was 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8445.52)|
| 2:20:51| And ultimately they have some cash flow issues or had at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8451.52)|
| 2:20:58| And so we were trying to help them from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8458.52)|
| 2:21:01| So we did an advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8461.52)|
| 2:21:05| And then ultimately a little after that, there was some damage to the Mobile Mills kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8465.28)|
| 2:21:12| We gave them a loan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8472.28)|
| 2:21:14| And they repaid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8474.28)|
| 2:21:16| And that repayment ended this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8476.28)|
| 2:21:19| And so we come up with a way to move that payment over from since the loan on the Mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8479.28)|
| 2:21:28| Mills kitchen is done to just continue that payment but let it go towards the advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8488.28)|
| 2:21:35| And that advance should be paid off in about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8495.04)|
| 2:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8498.04)|
| 2:21:39| And then I understand that they, CAC made some partial payments on the 2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8499.04)|
| 2:21:46| Were those credited as towards the loan amount or was some of that towards interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8506.04)|
| 2:21:53| It would be towards the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8513.04)|
| 2:21:56| At the time, and period if I'm wrong, he'll stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8516.04)|
| 2:22:00| There was no interest on the advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8520.04)|
| 2:22:02| We did the interest based off going forward from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8522.800000000001)|
| 2:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8528.800000000001)|
| 2:22:09| And then because we've had to carry this on our books for so long, for 15 years, was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8529.800000000001)|
| 2:22:16| comptroller or the treasury notified or did they spot this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8536.800000000001)|
| 2:22:21| They're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8541.800000000001)|
| 2:22:23| And advance is not something that's uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8543.800000000001)|
| 2:22:29| But we did get notification I think a couple years ago from the state saying that if payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8549.56)|
| 2:22:38| are not being made to lower the advance amount, then you need to write that advance off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8558.56)|
| 2:22:43| And so they let us know that they wanted to start seeing that advance balance being reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8563.56)|
| 2:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8574.56)|
| 2:22:55| And then on the actual repayment schedule, how was the interest rate of 1%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8575.56)|
| 2:23:06| Who came up with that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8586.56)|
| 2:23:10| Because we currently, our overnight rate is what, 4.9%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8590.56)|
| 2:23:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8596.56)|
| 2:23:17| If we'd had 2.5 million in the bank, we would be getting 4.9% interest on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8597.56)|
| 2:23:23| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8603.56)|
| 2:23:25| We just charged CCAC the same rate that we charged circuit court for their ARPA loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8605.56)|
| 2:23:31| back when that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8611.56)|
| 2:23:33| And I guess when we negotiated this, this was long before the interest rates went up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8613.56)|
| 2:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8619.56)|
| 2:23:40| So this has been a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8620.56)|
| 2:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8621.56)|
| 2:23:42| That's why I was wondering because that was the same rate we charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8622.56)|
| 2:23:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8624.56)|
| 2:23:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8625.56)|
| 2:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8626.56)|
| 2:23:47| We did this back summer, early fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8627.56)|
| 2:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8630.56)|
| 2:23:51| And do you feel like they'll be able to repay the loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8631.56)|
| 2:23:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8635.56)|
| 2:23:56| Perry's shaking yes, so that means that's a done deal then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8636.56)|
| 2:23:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8639.56)|
| 2:24:02| We think they had the ability probably even before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8642.56)|
| 2:24:07| that we had to walk them through that process to get them to a place of comfort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8647.56)|
| 2:24:11| and we feel that we're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8651.56)|
| 2:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8653.56)|
| 2:24:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8654.56)|

| 2:26:04| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8764.56)|
| 2:26:11| Page 8, item 46, resolution 905, is encouraging Governor Bill Lee to adopt and fund in the state budget the following four recommendations of Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally concerning school safety in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8771.56)|
| 2:26:27| Securing windows and glass in school buildings, magnetic locks on doors, centralized and modernized camera systems, and armed guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8787.56)|
| 2:26:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8798.56)|
| 2:26:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8799.56)|
| 2:26:43| Motion to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8803.56)|
| 2:26:48| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8808.56)|
| 2:26:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8809.56)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8811.56)|
| 2:26:52| I had the opportunity on Friday morning to meet with Lieutenant Governor McNally, and I presented our resolution to him, and he was very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8812.56)|
| 2:27:05| In our conversation, he said that he was working with the members of the Senate and with the House to see if the appropriations for all four items could be accomplished in this budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8825.56)|
| 2:27:21| And he said, as of Friday, he wasn't sure about that, but if it wasn't accomplished, it would definitely be accomplished next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8841.56)|
| 2:27:32| He did say that members of the Senate and the House were going to be working, I believe it's this coming Sunday, on some of these budget issues that are behind the budget to make sure that they can move forward with this, because this is very important for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8852.56)|
| 2:27:51| And there's also another kind of a companion bill that's going through that passed the State Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8871.56)|
| 2:27:58| It's Senate Bill 274.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8878.56)|
| 2:28:01| That's already passed 33 to zip, and it deals with three different amendments that addresses the type of equipment that needs to be installed in our schools and the type of drills that will have to be mandatory that they'll have to take place on a yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8881.56)|
| 2:28:25| And the House, I think, is supposed to take up their bill, Companion Bill 322, this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8905.56)|
| 2:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8915.56)|
| 2:28:40| I was under the impression that House bill passed on April 6th, but I will look back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8920.56)|
| 2:28:47| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8927.56)|
| 2:28:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8929.56)|
| 2:28:50| Commissioner Schoomaker, since you sit down with Senator McNally, this is talking about securing windows and glass in school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8930.56)|
| 2:29:00| But just like what happened in Covenant, that is a private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8940.56)|
| 2:29:06| Now, is this going to be considered all private schools and then also where they have, say, Mother's Day outs or preschools that's actually at churches or different buildings as opposed to school buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8946.56)|
| 2:29:20| Well, in the Senate bill, they're addressing both public schools and public charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8960.56)|
| 2:29:29| I think there's actually going to be, I'm trying to find it here, on another, also they are referencing a church-related school and a private school in the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8969.56)|
| 2:29:44| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8984.56)|
| 2:29:45| They have, apparently, there is some kind of film that can go on glass that makes it so you can't do what happened in that church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8985.56)|
| 2:29:55| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8995.56)|
| 2:29:56| Because I know that there's a lot of the Mother's Day out and preschool programs that's recognized by the state, so I wasn't sure how they were going to fall underneath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8996.56)|
| 2:30:04| Also, on the last, when it says armed guards, and that to me sounds like it's military, is it actually going to be SRO officers or SSO officers and they just put armed guards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9004.56)|
| 2:30:19| Well, that was actually the caption, the way the letter was written to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9019.56)|
| 2:30:27| So, what it actually means is school resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9027.56)|
| 2:30:31| Okay, so an SRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9031.56)|
| 2:30:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9032.56)|
| 2:30:33| In other words, when Randy McNally sent his letter to the governor, Bill Lee, that's how he just put it in four captions and then each caption had a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9033.56)|
| 2:30:45| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9045.56)|
| 2:30:46| Just for consolidation, Jill designed it this way just to make it, because that's the high point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9046.56)|
| 2:30:51| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9051.56)|
| 2:30:52| When I saw that, I was like, are we going to hire ex-military and put them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9052.56)|
| 2:30:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9057.56)|
| 2:30:58| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9058.56)|
| 2:30:59| Just curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9059.56)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9060.56)|
| 2:31:03| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9063.56)|
| 2:31:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9064.56)|
| 2:31:05| That was my question as well, the language of armed guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9065.56)|
| 2:31:08| I was just wondering if we could be more consistent with language used in most of the school legislation, which is security resource officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9068.56)|
| 2:31:16| I don't know if you would be agreeable to a friendly amendment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9076.56)|
| 2:31:21| Here's the way that it's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9081.56)|
| 2:31:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9084.56)|
| 2:31:26| This is Randy McNally's words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9086.56)|
| 2:31:28| While we've made great progress in making sure our public schools have access to school resource officers, I believe we can do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9088.56)|
| 2:31:38| Reports indicate that the shooter at Covenant chose the school because of its minimal security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9098.56)|
| 2:31:45| If we can ensure that all schools, public and private, have armed guards, we will be able to cut down on these events significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9105.56)|
| 2:31:52| So we have armed guards in our schools right now, in our Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9112.56)|
| 2:31:58| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9118.56)|
| 2:32:00| Yes, but they're security resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9120.56)|
| 2:32:04| I'm just a stickler about wording and legislation kind of just aligning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9124.56)|
| 2:32:10| I think what they're trying to say is it's somebody who's trained how to use a firearm as opposed to just somebody who doesn't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9130.56)|
| 2:32:28| Anybody else have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9148.56)|
| 2:32:31| I had a question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9151.56)|
| 2:32:34| I know it is important for all these security measures to be enforced in all school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9154.56)|
| 2:32:40| Is there a security audit that would take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9160.56)|
| 2:32:46| Of course, this would definitely go forward with new construction of school buildings, but how do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9166.56)|
| 2:32:53| Some schools may already have magnetic locks on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9173.56)|
| 2:32:57| Is there anything like that that you know of that's in the works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9177.56)|
| 2:33:00| Just a security audit or at least the money for that to go to each LEA to perform the school security audit on every school in the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9180.56)|
| 2:33:12| In the Senate bill, they talk about security systems, visual recording systems, cameras, communication systems, and how to interact with the 911 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9192.56)|
| 2:33:31| They will also, each school, safety team, private school, and church-related school shall conduct at least one armed intruder drill, incident command drill, and emergency safety bus drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9211.56)|
| 2:33:45| And then it spells out what each of those three items, what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9225.56)|
| 2:33:54| Okay, so there's not specifically something that says put forth money to each individual LEA to have a security audit done on all schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9234.56)|
| 2:34:08| Yeah, I believe they'll handle that when the Senate and House members are going to be able to get together and discuss the final budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9248.56)|
| 2:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9259.56)|
| 2:34:20| That's my understanding at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9260.56)|
| 2:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9262.56)|
| 2:34:23| I mean, things could change tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9263.56)|
| 2:34:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9264.56)|
| 2:34:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9265.56)|
| 2:34:28| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9268.56)|
| 2:34:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9270.56)|
| 2:34:31| This is a great discussion, but as the security personnel would like to say, loose lips sink ships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9271.56)|
| 2:34:40| So we really don't need to know which school is what, and you don't let the bad guys know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9280.56)|
| 2:34:50| You know, I trust that our school system is doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9290.56)|
| 2:34:56| That being said, I know some security measures have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9296.56)|
| 2:35:00| So loose lips sink ships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9300.56)|
| 2:35:03| I don't think we need to request what school is getting what or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9303.56)|
| 2:35:08| We just need to be observant, can't even say the word, ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9308.56)|
| 2:35:14| And Commissioner Daley, that was not my intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9314.56)|
| 2:35:16| It's more to eliminate any kind of deficit in security that one school building may have where the one down the street may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9316.56)|
| 2:35:26| And to focus our attention there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9326.56)|
| 2:35:29| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9329.56)|
| 2:35:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9330.56)|
| 2:35:31| Yeah, I think if we're going to be a commission that's going to send this to the state, I think each commissioner needs to know how this is, how it's going to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9331.56)|
| 2:35:44| I don't need to know their security plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9344.56)|
| 2:35:48| That's the school and the school system's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9348.56)|
| 2:35:51| But I do need to know, like I say, are we going to have military people that are going to be there or SRO officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9351.56)|
| 2:36:01| I mean, you have to, we have to have some specifics when we sign on to things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9361.56)|
| 2:36:06| So that's my, Madam Chair's having a little problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9366.56)|
| 2:36:12| It fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9372.56)|
| 2:36:15| Hey, look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9375.56)|
| 2:36:18| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9378.56)|
| 2:36:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9380.56)|
| 2:36:21| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9381.56)|
| 2:36:25| Sometimes I think we get ahead of the horse before the cart there, cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9385.56)|
| 2:36:31| And I think these two resolutions are good resolutions, but we don't know what the outcome is going to be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9391.56)|
| 2:36:40| It can change tremendously between now and next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9400.56)|
| 2:36:44| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9404.56)|
| 2:36:47| I would like to wait and see what's going on before I make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9407.56)|
| 2:36:55| The next one coming up, I've got a heartburn because I don't know what they're going to do down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9415.56)|
| 2:37:01| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9421.56)|
| 2:37:03| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9423.56)|
| 2:37:05| Madam Chair, may I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9425.56)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9427.56)|
| 2:37:09| I appreciate you bringing that up, Commissioner Daley, because I wasn't going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9429.56)|
| 2:37:13| I really was kind of teetering on whether I was going to say this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9433.56)|
| 2:37:17| But I think I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9437.56)|
| 2:37:19| I don't have a problem with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9439.56)|
| 2:37:22| And let me say how impressed I was with our students coming down and speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9442.56)|
| 2:37:26| and other people that are speaking about gun safety and our kids' safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9446.56)|
| 2:37:32| I think I would rather have seen a resolution like this maybe come in May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9452.56)|
| 2:37:38| I kind of feel like that these resolutions and the law should have been done years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9458.56)|
| 2:37:48| And I don't want to jump into a political battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9468.56)|
| 2:37:53| And I almost kind of feel like that's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9473.56)|
| 2:37:56| And we really haven't even taken a breath to really respect the families that have just buried their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9476.56)|
| 2:38:03| And so for me it's not a political thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9483.56)|
| 2:38:07| It is definitely a safety thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9487.56)|
| 2:38:10| But that's where I'm having a little heartburn about it even being on the agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9490.56)|
| 2:38:16| I'm not saying that I don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9496.56)|
| 2:38:20| I just don't want this to be a political fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9500.56)|
| 2:38:26| And I feel like it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9506.56)|
| 2:38:28| And it doesn't need to be at the expense of anybody's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9508.56)|
| 2:38:32| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9512.56)|
| 2:38:35| I'm kind of having the heartburn with it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9515.56)|
| 2:38:46| Testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9526.56)|
| 2:38:49| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9529.56)|
| 2:38:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9536.56)|
| 2:39:00| I'm a little confused about the conversation about timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9540.56)|
| 2:39:06| Item number 46 and item number 48, they're statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9546.56)|
| 2:39:13| I mean, we have no control over what the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9553.56)|
| 2:39:16| We have no control over what the state allocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9556.56)|
| 2:39:18| We have no control over what the state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9558.56)|
| 2:39:24| And, you know, all of our public schools are state schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9564.56)|
| 2:39:28| We just operate and administer them on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9568.56)|
| 2:39:31| So these two resolutions are just statements saying if on 46, if you think Governor McNally is on the right track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9571.56)|
| 2:39:43| and this commission wants to make a statement, a political, this is a political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9583.56)|
| 2:39:49| This is an opinion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9589.56)|
| 2:39:52| And number 48, if you feel like Governor Bill Lee is on the right track, these are just two resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9592.56)|
| 2:39:57| Now, they are likely going to finish their session by next Friday or Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9597.56)|
| 2:40:03| So if these get approved tonight as approvals, then, well, no, they can't be approved until next Monday anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9603.56)|
| 2:40:15| I mean, the session is going to be over by the time anything is actually taken in formal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9615.56)|
| 2:40:20| And a resolution would be signed by our chair and law department and mayor and sent to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9620.56)|
| 2:40:27| So the sessions, anything they're going to do is going to be done well before they even get the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9627.56)|
| 2:40:33| I think this commission body has to just decide, do you want to agree with these two statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9633.56)|
| 2:40:40| And as an opinion of this body, do we feel like they're on the right track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9640.56)|
| 2:40:45| And if so, I wouldn't wait until next week or any month thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9645.56)|
| 2:40:51| Just make your voice heard tonight because it has no bearing on what they're going to do between now and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9651.56)|
| 2:40:57| At best case scenario, after their session is done, they're going to get a copy from us a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9657.56)|
| 2:41:02| And whatever they've done is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9662.56)|
| 2:41:04| So I would encourage us to just go ahead and take action on both of these tonight and make your voice heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9664.56)|
| 2:41:11| If it's a unanimous vote, it gets approved, it stays on consent next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9671.56)|
| 2:41:15| and then we'll send a resolution over a week after they're out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9675.56)|
| 2:41:19| If it doesn't get unanimously approved at either one of those, then we'll move it forward to next week and do another vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9679.56)|
| 2:41:26| And to me, that, I think, just pushes the ball down the road and makes it a bigger political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9686.56)|
| 2:41:34| I think these are pretty simple resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9694.56)|
| 2:41:36| They're pretty simple statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9696.56)|
| 2:41:39| And I would just encourage us to take action tonight on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9699.56)|
| 2:41:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9706.56)|
| 2:41:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9709.56)|
| 2:41:53| When I saw what Representative, excuse me, Senator McNally's effort to notify the governor that we needed to take action quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9713.56)|
| 2:42:05| one of my thoughts was because Senator McNally represents citizens in Knox County, a small portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9725.56)|
| 2:42:15| And I thought, you know, here's somebody who wants to go forward with taking some immediate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9735.56)|
| 2:42:23| and to get the attention of the governor, and he's doing it for not only the kids in Knox County, but for all 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9743.56)|
| 2:42:32| And I think that when they try to do a letter to the governor, you try to make it as simple and concise as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9752.56)|
| 2:42:42| There was never any legislative intent to have armed military troops in any schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9762.56)|
| 2:42:49| It's simply saying that they would have school resource officers who are armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9769.56)|
| 2:42:57| There's a caption in the Senate bill that actually lines out what the private schools and church-related schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9777.56)|
| 2:43:08| what their course of action is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9788.56)|
| 2:43:11| As far as by October 1st, they have to submit to the local law enforcement in their community what their actual action plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9791.56)|
| 2:43:21| And every October 1st from that point forward, they have to submit that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9801.56)|
| 2:43:27| so law enforcement knows exactly what's going on with that appropriate church-related school or private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9807.56)|
| 2:43:39| I think it's pretty detailed on what kind of drills they want to have, but we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9819.56)|
| 2:43:46| And I just thought this was a great way to support our state senator and our lieutenant governor at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9826.56)|
| 2:43:54| and do something that is a positive effort, hopefully to save the lives of some of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9834.56)|
| 2:44:07| Thank you. Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9847.56)|
| 2:44:11| Thank you. I just want to say I know it may be a little uncomfortable because of party lines or whatever, people's beliefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9851.56)|
| 2:44:18| but I think with both resolutions, I think we're just saying let's do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9858.56)|
| 2:44:24| We know that it's up to the state to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9864.56)|
| 2:44:27| I mean, I will support this resolution that's before us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9867.56)|
| 2:44:33| I might not agree with everything, but I think we have to just stand in what we believe in and support the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9873.56)|
| 2:44:39| and hopefully the state can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9879.56)|
| 2:44:42| That's what our constituents are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9882.56)|
| 2:44:45| They're not asking for a Democrat or a Republican to have their own opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9885.56)|
| 2:44:50| It's about saving these kids and saving our communities. I'm complete. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9890.56)|
| 2:44:57| Thank you. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9897.56)|
| 2:45:00| If not, the motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9900.56)|
| 2:45:09| Seeing no more discussion, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9909.56)|
| 2:45:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9912.56)|
| 2:45:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9913.56)|
| 2:45:15| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9915.56)|
| 2:45:17| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9917.56)|
| 2:45:20| Item number 47 is Resolution 906 requesting the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission to recommend amendments to Section 2.20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9920.56)|
| 2:45:28| of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance regarding the definition of swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9928.56)|
| 2:45:34| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9934.56)|
| 2:45:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9936.56)|
| 2:45:40| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9940.56)|
| 2:45:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9946.56)|
| 2:45:50| I will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9950.56)|
| 2:45:52| Yeah, why did you... I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9952.56)|
| 2:45:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9956.56)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9960.56)|
| 2:46:02| Do you want to let us know why this was what you wanted to bring before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9962.56)|
| 2:46:08| Yeah, and codes are still here back there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9968.56)|
| 2:46:14| This is a, you've got a picture here of a hot tub that's been sitting in a subdivision for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9974.56)|
| 2:46:23| and we have asked, codes has gone and asked them to move it to the side or back of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9983.56)|
| 2:46:31| and this is the first thing that the neighbors, and you driving by, that's the first thing you see is this hot tub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9991.56)|
| 2:46:38| Well, in our codes, we have no definition of a swimming pool hot tub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9998.56)|
| 2:46:46| how it's to be operated, and maybe where it's supposed to be set or put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10006.56)|
| 2:46:51| So what we're asking, after meeting with Mr. Snowden and codes and the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10011.56)|
| 2:46:57| we're asking planning to go and look at it with a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10017.56)|
| 2:47:01| If you would read the caption there, Mr. Moyers, law director Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10021.56)|
| 2:47:06| has come up with what a definition of a swimming pool, 24 inches of water, you need to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10026.56)|
| 2:47:14| So what this will do, it will send it to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10034.56)|
| 2:47:18| Planning will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10038.56)|
| 2:47:20| They'll make a suggestion whether to do it or not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10040.56)|
| 2:47:23| Then it comes back to us for our vote, our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10043.56)|
| 2:47:28| Mr. Snowden, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10048.56)|
| 2:47:33| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10053.56)|
| 2:47:34| Right now, the way the ordinance is worded, a swimming pool or hot tub is kind of categorized the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10054.56)|
| 2:47:41| It has to have 24 inches of water in it, and with this structure being tarped over, it's essentially construction material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10061.56)|
| 2:47:49| So it's a little bit of a gray area, and your proposal would clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10069.56)|
| 2:47:55| And hopefully the proposal will come back to where it has to be operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10075.56)|
| 2:48:01| And I don't know if we can keep somebody from having a hot tub in the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10081.56)|
| 2:48:06| but at least we know that it's going to be operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10086.56)|
| 2:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10090.56)|
| 2:48:11| Mr. Law director, is that correct to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10091.56)|
| 2:48:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10094.56)|
| 2:48:15| The current definition of a swimming pool is any structure designed for swimming or bathing that has at least 24 inches of water in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10095.56)|
| 2:48:22| So what we're asking the planning commission to do is to say that it's any structure designed for swimming or bathing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10102.56)|
| 2:48:28| that has the capacity to have at least two feet of water in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10108.56)|
| 2:48:32| irregardless of whether it actually has the water in it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10112.56)|
| 2:48:35| So under the new definition, this hot tub would qualify as a swimming pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10115.56)|
| 2:48:40| and under our regs it would have to be in the side yard or the rear yard of the home, like any other swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10120.56)|
| 2:48:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10131.56)|
| 2:48:52| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10132.56)|
| 2:48:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10134.56)|
| 2:48:55| And just to lighten the mood a little bit, can anyone tell me what recreational bathing consists of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10135.56)|
| 2:49:06| Well, I think it's swimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10146.56)|
| 2:49:08| You have a bathing suit, not a swimming suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10148.56)|
| 2:49:11| I guess you could be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10151.56)|
| 2:49:20| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10160.56)|
| 2:49:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10162.56)|
| 2:49:23| Commissioner Daley, I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10163.56)|
| 2:49:25| I'm actually dealing with a zoning, I mean with a codes issue in my district right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10165.56)|
| 2:49:32| that I've got to go to the law department about and get some things changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10172.56)|
| 2:49:35| so I appreciate you making it a little bit more narrow for us that we were able to hone in on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10175.56)|
| 2:49:42| It's a problem for other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10182.56)|
| 2:49:47| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10187.56)|
| 2:49:48| Just one comment on this specific address that they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10188.56)|
| 2:49:59| This is the first house when you pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10199.56)|
| 2:50:03| I mean, there's no missing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10203.56)|
| 2:50:05| Even if they were to move it to the side of the house, it would still be equally as ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10205.56)|
| 2:50:10| because it would still just be sitting there in your face when you pulled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10210.56)|
| 2:50:14| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10214.56)|
| 2:50:17| Can we make them put a fence around it or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10217.56)|
| 2:50:21| Just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10221.56)|
| 2:50:23| Perhaps you can talk to codes about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10223.56)|
| 2:50:28| Any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10228.56)|
| 2:50:32| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10232.56)|
| 2:50:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10237.56)|
| 2:50:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10239.56)|
| 2:50:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10240.56)|
| 2:50:42| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10242.56)|
| 2:50:43| Commissioner Durett, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10243.56)|
| 2:50:44| Item number 48, resolution 907, is urging the state legislature to support Governor Bill Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10244.56)|
| 2:50:51| in his executive order and recommendations to the state legislature regarding a stronger order of protection law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10251.56)|
| 2:51:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10260.56)|
| 2:51:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10261.56)|
| 2:51:03| Motion to approve by Commissioner Lundy with a second by Commissioner Durett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10263.56)|
| 2:51:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10271.56)|
| 2:51:16| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10276.56)|
| 2:51:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10278.56)|
| 2:51:20| As Commissioner Jay said, this will probably be gone before even we get a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10280.56)|
| 2:51:28| As one who has purchased guns, shotguns in the past, a more effective, comprehensive, timely background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10288.56)|
| 2:51:39| I can't leave that building until they check me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10299.56)|
| 2:51:43| I've got my driver's license, they run the check, and before I can walk out of Bass Pro or wherever, I've been checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10303.56)|
| 2:51:52| So I'm not sure what's more instant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10312.56)|
| 2:51:55| Maybe at gun shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10315.56)|
| 2:51:59| I don't think they do them at gun shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10319.56)|
| 2:52:06| Order of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10326.56)|
| 2:52:10| Order of protection, as I've been told by a few lawyers, is just a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10330.56)|
| 2:52:16| Commissioner Lundy, can you help me out on, do you know what the governor wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10336.56)|
| 2:52:22| I've been Googling it, and I can't find anything that Governor Lee's executive order 100, anything about protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10342.56)|
| 2:52:31| Do you know anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10351.56)|
| 2:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10355.56)|
| 2:52:37| The executive order 100, and I have it right here if you want to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10357.56)|
| 2:52:43| basically it's enhancing protective procedures for the purchase of firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10363.56)|
| 2:52:47| and it does reference those where there are loopholes, such as gun shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10367.56)|
| 2:52:53| And I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10373.56)|
| 2:52:56| We named them specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10376.56)|
| 2:52:58| It says this is the meat of the executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10378.56)|
| 2:53:03| All entities with obligations to report relevant information that is accessible to the Tennessee Instant Check System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10383.56)|
| 2:53:10| shall ensure that it's entered within 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10390.56)|
| 2:53:14| For this order, information is criminal history and court mental health information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10394.56)|
| 2:53:22| That's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10402.56)|
| 2:53:24| Administrative office of the court shall ensure the subsequent courts of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10404.56)|
| 2:53:30| accurately, completely, and timely submit relevant information to either the TBI's flex check database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10410.56)|
| 2:53:35| or directly to the TBI for entry into the aforementioned check system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10415.56)|
| 2:53:41| The TBI shall review the TICS to determine how the process for submitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10421.56)|
| 2:53:46| and then it goes into the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10426.56)|
| 2:53:49| And so that's the executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10429.56)|
| 2:53:52| And also, the stronger order of protection law came out of his press conference that he gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10432.56)|
| 2:54:00| when he first read this executive order, and it's more of to ensure that those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10440.56)|
| 2:54:07| and it goes back to that mental health, temporarily don't have access to any weapons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10447.56)|
| 2:54:14| that could, if they are in a state where they could harm themselves or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10454.56)|
| 2:54:20| So this resolution has, looks like it has two things, the instant check system and order protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10460.56)|
| 2:54:30| It does not, is it covering those two things, which I see this resolution doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10470.56)|
| 2:54:35| which that's the case I have no problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10475.56)|
| 2:54:38| But is it covering the whole governor's executive order, which is the red flag laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10478.56)|
| 2:54:49| No, his executive order does not have anything about red flag laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10489.56)|
| 2:54:52| He urged recommendation, he recommended things to the state legislature to look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10492.56)|
| 2:54:59| quote, unquote, red flag laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10499.56)|
| 2:55:01| But the executive order itself does not mention those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10501.56)|
| 2:55:08| Mr. Law Director, orders of protection, I guess you've done them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10508.56)|
| 2:55:15| Can you walk, seriously, really, I took, when I did the Attorney General's Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10515.56)|
| 2:55:21| we walked into a room of order of protection, and it was file cabinets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10521.56)|
| 2:55:27| just file cabinet after file cabinet after file cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10527.56)|
| 2:55:30| So will you walk us through what an order of protection is and what it really does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10530.56)|
| 2:55:35| Well, an order of protection is, an officer cannot generally arrest a person for a misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10535.56)|
| 2:55:47| unless the officer witnesses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10547.56)|
| 2:55:49| So if somebody is stalking somebody or harassing somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10549.56)|
| 2:55:54| unless the officer witnesses it, if it's a misdemeanor, the officer can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10554.56)|
| 2:55:58| The order of protection allows the officer to arrest a person who is in violation of the order on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10558.56)|
| 2:56:06| So it gives the police a bit more leeway to keep away people who the court have adjudged need to be kept away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10566.56)|
| 2:56:19| Typically, those are stalking type cases, domestic violence type cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10579.56)|
| 2:56:28| There are only certain classes of people who can get them, and that's generally domestic relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10588.56)|
| 2:56:36| So former boyfriends, girlfriends, former spouses, sometimes family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10596.56)|
| 2:56:42| It's not just general people, generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10602.56)|
| 2:56:48| And under federal law, if an order of protection goes down against a person after a hearing on the merits and findings by the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10608.56)|
| 2:56:59| then the person is required to give up any firearms that he has for, I think, a year's period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10619.56)|
| 2:57:05| or at least during the period that the order of protection is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10625.56)|
| 2:57:10| So they have to sign a document and bring their weapons to the sheriff upon the order of protection being granted against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10630.56)|
| 2:57:21| So that's how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10641.56)|
| 2:57:23| If you have any other questions, does that explain it more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10643.56)|
| 2:57:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10649.56)|
| 2:57:31| I just have some technical questions about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10651.56)|
| 2:57:34| If Commissioner Lee wants to go next, it's up, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10654.56)|
| 2:57:43| Me, her, me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10663.56)|
| 2:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10664.56)|
| 2:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10665.56)|
| 2:57:47| In the public forum comments, did I pick up that one of the road actually wrote this resolution, or did I misunderstand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10667.56)|
| 2:57:59| Was this written by one of our former commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10679.56)|
| 2:58:04| I'm seeing a yes it was, so I did hear that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10684.56)|
| 2:58:12| This resolution was written by me, but some of the language has been borrowed from nonprofit Voices for a Safer TN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10692.56)|
| 2:58:20| so it is not just the language of high schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10700.56)|
| 2:58:23| This is coming from a legit nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10703.56)|
| 2:58:27| Go ahead and state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10707.56)|
| 2:58:30| Caroline Schoonmaker, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10710.56)|
| 2:58:32| Stay there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10712.56)|
| 2:58:37| It's my understanding when they say that the number one cause of death of our children, it's actually automobile accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10717.56)|
| 2:58:47| It's not gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10727.56)|
| 2:58:49| So that's why I was wondering where this came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10729.56)|
| 2:58:53| Where did the 22% of gun purchases in Tennessee are made without a background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10733.56)|
| 2:58:58| How could you even possibly come up with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10738.56)|
| 2:59:02| Did you do the research on that, or was this from that website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10742.56)|
| 2:59:06| This is from Voices for a Safer TN, but first of all, the leading cause of death of our children in the United States as of this year is gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10746.56)|
| 2:59:22| It recently surpassed automobile accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10762.56)|
| 2:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10767.56)|
| 2:59:28| And then the 22%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10768.56)|
| 2:59:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10773.56)|
| 2:59:34| That came from research done by Voices for a Safer TN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10774.56)|
| 2:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10778.56)|
| 2:59:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10779.56)|
| 2:59:40| And then let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10780.56)|
| 2:59:44| You're saying 100% of the – did I read this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10784.56)|
| 2:59:49| We don't have background checks for everybody that purchases a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10789.56)|
| 2:59:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10792.56)|
| 2:59:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10794.56)|
| 2:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10795.56)|
| 2:59:56| So, for instance, if – I'll pick on Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10796.56)|
| 3:00:02| Suppose Commissioner Daley has an old beat-up shotgun that he wants to sell to his nephew for 50 bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10802.56)|
| 3:00:09| He's got to go get a background check on his nephew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10809.56)|
| 3:00:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10816.56)|
| 3:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10818.56)|
| 3:00:19| And then in the – I guess this would be to the sponsors of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10819.56)|
| 3:00:24| In the letter – excuse me, you said it was Executive Order 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10824.56)|
| 3:00:35| Was there legislation attached to that executive order that's currently going through the Senate and House of Representatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10835.56)|
| 3:00:44| For the particular executive order or for his recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10844.56)|
| 3:00:49| No, because in his right as the executive of the state, he can issue executive orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10849.56)|
| 3:00:57| That's true, but usually there's companion legislation that they'll go into all kinds of details on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10857.56)|
| 3:01:03| Just like the previous one, there was a Senate bill attached to how to go from A to B to C to D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10863.56)|
| 3:01:11| But anyways, I just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10871.56)|
| 3:01:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker, if I can make a correction, the background checks is for, as it says in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10873.56)|
| 3:01:22| online sales at a gun show or from an unlicensed dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10882.56)|
| 3:01:27| Well, he would be an unlicensed dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10887.56)|
| 3:01:31| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10891.56)|
| 3:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10892.56)|
| 3:01:34| I think it's important for us to not get into the weeds and debate every part and piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10894.56)|
| 3:01:40| The resolution is really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10900.56)|
| 3:01:42| It says the commission of Knox County hereby urges our state legislature to support Governor Lee in his executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10902.56)|
| 3:01:53| empowering the Tennessee instant check system to conduct more effective, comprehensive, and timely background checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10913.56)|
| 3:01:59| of those potential purchasers and firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10919.56)|
| 3:02:02| So this whole resolution is to encourage our state legislatures to support the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10922.56)|
| 3:02:07| That's the whole purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10927.56)|
| 3:02:09| It doesn't get into the minutiae of odd laws or background checks or any number of thousand other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10929.56)|
| 3:02:17| that we could debate on for the next 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10937.56)|
| 3:02:21| It urges the state legislature to support our governor in the executive order that he issued, plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10941.56)|
| 3:02:28| I really encourage us not to go down the rabbit hole of debating every little part and piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10948.56)|
| 3:02:40| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10960.56)|
| 3:02:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10962.56)|
| 3:02:45| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10965.56)|
| 3:02:48| I don't want to get too much in the weeds, but I will say as a criminal defense attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10968.56)|
| 3:02:54| that convicted felons aren't allowed to have guns, but they get guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10974.56)|
| 3:03:00| So anybody that wants a gun, if they want a gun, they can get a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10980.56)|
| 3:03:05| Laws don't keep guns away from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10985.56)|
| 3:03:08| So I am putting this in the hands of a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10988.56)|
| 3:03:13| If you want to talk about orders of protection, people come to this courthouse every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10993.56)|
| 3:03:18| accuse their boyfriend or girlfriend of assaulting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10998.56)|
| 3:03:22| Automatically, they get an order of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11002.56)|
| 3:03:27| And then these cases, a lot of times they get thrown by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11007.56)|
| 3:03:30| It's just couples getting into a dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11010.56)|
| 3:03:34| I would not want to say that a court or some kind of body could take away our gun rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11014.56)|
| 3:03:41| because that is not going to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11021.56)|
| 3:03:44| The states that have the toughest gun laws have the worst violence in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11024.56)|
| 3:03:49| That doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11029.56)|
| 3:03:51| So I would not support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11031.56)|
| 3:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11035.56)|
| 3:03:58| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11038.56)|
| 3:04:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11040.56)|
| 3:04:02| Mr. Moyers, could you answer a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11042.56)|
| 3:04:05| On his executive order, right now I know as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11045.56)|
| 3:04:08| HIPAA doesn't allow a psychologist or a psychiatrist to report a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11048.56)|
| 3:04:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11057.56)|
| 3:04:19| With this executive order, is that going to change that or are they still going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11059.56)|
| 3:04:23| They still don't have to report to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11063.56)|
| 3:04:26| I'm not exactly sure what the governor means by the language that Commissioner Durrett wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11066.56)|
| 3:04:35| I understand I wasn't in every court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11075.56)|
| 3:04:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11078.56)|
| 3:04:39| The things, the kind of cases that I dealt with that would involve mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11079.56)|
| 3:04:43| would be conservatorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11083.56)|
| 3:04:48| Very rarely would I think that information from a conservatorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11088.56)|
| 3:04:51| would be helpful in a background check situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11091.56)|
| 3:04:55| because they generally involve people who are very elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11095.56)|
| 3:04:58| Occasionally you get somebody who is younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11098.56)|
| 3:05:01| But I don't know too many, at least in the Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11101.56)|
| 3:05:05| I don't know, I can't think of too many situations that I dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11105.56)|
| 3:05:08| where I would have had a situation where I would have had information that I would report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11108.56)|
| 3:05:13| And that's not to say there might not be other courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11113.56)|
| 3:05:17| When I think about it now, actually, we used to when we still had Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11117.56)|
| 3:05:23| which is lamentable that we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11123.56)|
| 3:05:26| I did used to do involuntary committals on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11126.56)|
| 3:05:31| And I don't know whether reporting the information of persons that we committed to Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11131.56)|
| 3:05:38| to the state background check system would be a violation of HIPAA or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11138.56)|
| 3:05:43| I know those hearings were held in chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11143.56)|
| 3:05:46| They were not in public court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11146.56)|
| 3:05:48| I think they were imbued with privacy considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11148.56)|
| 3:05:51| that would make it problematic to report them to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11151.56)|
| 3:05:56| HIPAA is a federal statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11156.56)|
| 3:05:59| And so while it might be laudable to make an exception to HIPAA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11159.56)|
| 3:06:06| for information held by, say, the FBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11166.56)|
| 3:06:10| you get into serious questions about privacy at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11170.56)|
| 3:06:13| Fully apart from gun violence and gun regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11173.56)|
| 3:06:19| we have decided in this country that medical records are to be held strictly confidentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11179.56)|
| 3:06:26| So we're talking about a debate that would have to go to the halls of Congress, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11186.56)|
| 3:06:31| for mental health information to be included in background checks to be acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11191.56)|
| 3:06:38| I didn't assume that it was going to with it being HIPAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11198.56)|
| 3:06:41| but I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11201.56)|
| 3:06:44| I mean, obviously that's an issue if somebody is having a mental crisis with guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11204.56)|
| 3:06:52| but that's not our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11212.56)|
| 3:06:56| I do agree with Commissioner Jay that we don't need to go down the rabbit hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11216.56)|
| 3:07:00| and I'm also going to fall back to his comment that he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11220.56)|
| 3:07:05| you know, we accept it and we move it on, or we don't and we stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11225.56)|
| 3:07:12| But, you know, I mean, I have to agree with Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11232.56)|
| 3:07:17| My point that I was trying to make, and maybe I didn't make it eloquently enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11237.56)|
| 3:07:21| I don't want this to get wrapped up in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11241.56)|
| 3:07:25| And this is exactly what it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11245.56)|
| 3:07:27| This is nothing but political posturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11247.56)|
| 3:07:31| And I just want it to be meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11251.56)|
| 3:07:35| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11255.56)|
| 3:07:37| Democrat, Republican, independent, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11257.56)|
| 3:07:40| It just needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11260.56)|
| 3:07:42| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11262.56)|
| 3:07:48| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11268.56)|

| 3:10:27| and the only other action would be to fall back to moving forward without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11427.56)|
| 3:10:32| I wonder if the sponsor and the second would consider amending their motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11432.56)|

| 3:13:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11603.56)|
| 3:13:25| Jim, did we accept in 2019 the 2018 International Building Codes by resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11605.56)|
| 3:13:37| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11617.56)|
| 3:13:38| We adopted, I think it was November of 2018, or maybe December, November, December, the 2018 ICC codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11618.56)|
| 3:13:48| And since at that time the state had not adopted the 2018, they have since adopted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11628.56)|
| 3:13:54| and there are some things that they have in there that we are less stringent than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11634.56)|
| 3:13:59| and by rule we cannot be less stringent than the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11639.56)|
| 3:14:02| So that's one of the reasons why we're back here with this adoption is to correct those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11642.56)|
| 3:14:07| as well as just over the last couple of years we've identified some things that we want to improve in our interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11647.56)|
| 3:14:14| and so we've addressed those as well to just make it a little better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11654.56)|
| 3:14:19| So we're maintaining the same standards as the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11659.56)|
| 3:14:22| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11662.56)|
| 3:14:23| Nothing less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11663.56)|
| 3:14:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11664.56)|
| 3:14:25| And the way our code stands today, we do have a couple of things that we're less stringent than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11665.56)|

| 3:24:44| I put mine up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12284.56)|
| 3:24:45| It's towards the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12285.56)|
| 3:24:46| It's sector plan change plus rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12286.56)|
| 3:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12293.56)|
| 3:24:54| That is there on John Speer Highway at Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12294.56)|
| 3:24:58| where we had done a sector plan change and a rezoning for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12298.56)|
| 3:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12302.56)|
| 3:25:03| There, right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12303.56)|
| 3:25:04| 62 and 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12304.56)|
| 3:25:05| I think it was 18, correct, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12305.56)|
| 3:25:11| I think it was 18 at the first apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12311.56)|
| 3:25:15| I think it was 18 at the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12315.56)|
| 3:25:17| Now it's seven on this one there, and it is going to be senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12317.56)|
| 3:25:22| So it will take a sector plan change plus a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12322.56)|
| 3:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12327.56)|
| 3:25:29| And then there's one in District 3, number 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12329.56)|
| 3:25:32| I have nothing because, yeah, I go ahead and meet with my people way ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12332.56)|
| 3:25:39| So mine is always zipped up and ready to go on zoning night, so we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12339.56)|
| 3:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12344.56)|

| 3:26:24| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12384.56)|
| 3:26:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12386.56)|
| 3:26:27| I just wanted to point it out that there are several zoning items that have conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12387.56)|
| 3:26:32| and it is very important that if you make a motion that you include those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12392.56)|
| 3:26:36| so that they can be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12396.56)|
| 3:26:38| I just wanted to remind the body of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12398.56)|
| 3:26:40| And then also Commissioner Beeler asked me to just briefly make a comment on number 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12400.56)|
| 3:26:47| which is a really great request going from rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12407.56)|
| 3:26:55| Well, it's actually asking for a rural preservation zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12415.56)|
| 3:26:59| and that's something we don't see very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12419.56)|
| 3:27:01| but this is a horse farm who wants to protect the rural settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12421.56)|
| 3:27:05| And so I just wanted to say thank you to that applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12425.56)|
| 3:27:09| for preserving some of our beautiful landscape out in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12429.56)|
| 3:27:18| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12438.56)|
| 3:27:19| Is there any more business to come before this Knox County Commission work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12439.56)|
| 3:27:25| Seeing none, motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12445.56)|
