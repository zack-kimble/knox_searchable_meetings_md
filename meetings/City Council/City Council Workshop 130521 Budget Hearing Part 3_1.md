| 1:20:03| It is not being recommended right now as part of the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| We have, I think we had 19 items that we had put in our capital request budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| and I think five of them have been suggested for council for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| So that particular restroom clubhouse facility is not currently in the funding request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| I just wanted to thank Joe and Christy Branscombe and a number of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| for stepping up to the plate at Badgett Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| It looks like a whole new place to play ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| People are really enjoying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Other teens that come there are surprised because it doesn't look like it did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| And also they've been able to schedule more tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| which helps them address financially some of their other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| So Joe and Christy and the whole crew really went above and beyond to bring that field up to speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4852)|
| 1:21:01| and we're also excited in the third district about connecting Victor Ash Park to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| I know we have a great partnership with all the recreation commissions in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| whether it's South Knoxville, Fountain City, Rocky Hill, West Hills, Northwest, Allensville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| Those volunteers do a great job organizing these youth teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| and bringing hundreds and hundreds of kids out for youth sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| and we try to do our part by making the facilities looking good and being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| Joe, where are we at on extending the back to our greenway to the naval base on Alcoa Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4890)|
| 1:21:40| The Knox Blunt Greenway, which has been in the works for several years, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| but we continue to have some issues, but we're making baby steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I guess I would defer to our engineering director because, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| the civil engineering division has really been taking the lead on doing the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| and overseeing that bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| We're still trying to get clearance from the CHPO and TVA on the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| that we've revised a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| There are high-value archaeological resources out there that we have to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| and we've been jumping through hoops trying to do something there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| that protects those resources appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| We have a proposal out there waiting to be approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| We're hoping that this round will get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| and we're hoping that we can bid that project, hopefully, this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| We actually, at one point, got to the point of bidding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| and then we got told that we couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| So, I mean, that was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| But on the bright side, when it is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| it will be over two miles of greenway along the south side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| It will be a very scenic greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We just need to get it on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Joe, any lessons learned from watching the outside bike groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| and stuff build that wilderness trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| In other words, they kind of put some just sweat equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| and a little bit of equipment to it and made a Forest Service dirt trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| And is there anything we can do better as a city to build trails that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| Certainly, I want to thank Appalachian Mountain Bike Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| and all their volunteers for what they've been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| They've built, you know, 20 or 30 miles of soft surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| multi-use trails, mostly in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| but we're also working with them right now at Fort Dickerson Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| and also up at Sharps Ridge as they're continuing to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| to build more and more of these trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Obviously, as times get tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| and finances become less available for greenway construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| rather than spending $800,000 to build a mile of greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| we can take one-tenth of that and build ten times more mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| using volunteer resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| But I think they've done a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| and we want to continue that kind of partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| But at some point, we're going to run out of natural trail areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| to build those kind of trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| and we need to also balance that out with building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| the ten-foot-wide asphalt trails that people have come to use and love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| The flip side of the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| do we have some handle on the cost and the time cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| for maintaining the asphalt greenway trails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| In other words, what is it looking like we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| as they start to age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| That's a good point, and as we want to expand our greenway system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| we also want to take care of those trails that are currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| And I know right now we are, I think tomorrow afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| we're going to be putting in the new bridge out there at Third Creek Bike Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| the one that kept on washing away every time we had a flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| So it will be replaced with a new steel bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| going to be put in place sometime tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| But we have $200,000 in our capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| which is being recommended for council approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| That will help us, ongoing maintenance and repair of asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| replacement of bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Is that in-house or contracted out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| That will be a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| David Grace, his crew do a great job helping us maintain the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| but occasionally we'll have to work with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| In the example of the bridge, we've contracted out the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Right, that's a little more sophisticated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| But repaving the surface, putting a two-inch top on it or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| is that something we do in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| We do, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| We do that also, and we also contract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| I know David's crews, when they're not doing streets and alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| take time to help us repave existing greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| But an example, when we have actually contracted it work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| we used the company that was doing the street paving last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| to repave Chartered Oil Park last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| We need to probably wrap this up with Mr. Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| and move on to Mr. Reynolds for the sake of time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5163)|
| 1:26:12| Page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| Okay, I'm Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I'm Deputy Director of Building Inspections and Plans Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| I'll go through this pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| and just talk about my department a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Our budget is pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| Very little levies, discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| and then what those discretionary funds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| are just things that keep our office going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| But the majority of our budget is salaries and our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| So, with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| our funding level is right at $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| It's always of interest to what we're one of the few departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| that create revenue for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| And I think revenue from our department is a reflection of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| especially the construction industry in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| but also a reflection of our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| And, of course, our revenue has gone down through the years as our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| I mean, our revenue went down probably the lowest level around 2000, about 2008, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| And then it's recently been coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| During 10, it was back up to $1.4 million, about the same thing in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| Then in 12, we've seen our biggest increase in several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| It was $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| And then we're, I think, thank goodness, we're on track for that to remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| We perform right at, so far, during this same period of April of last year, we performed 38,000 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5262)|
| 1:27:52| And this same period this year, we performed 41,000 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| So, we're up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| And some of that, I'll be perfectly fair with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| some of that is due to we've initiated a low voltage permitting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| which increased it a little bit, but we're also closing out a lot of open permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| So, I see our inspections actually on the construction site being about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| Our planned review and permit totals right now are right at 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| Of 1,100 of those are actually planned review performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| And then the rest of them are permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| We've had, and sometimes we, this has been one of the busiest years I've had since I've been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| at Building Inspection and Planned Review from the standpoint of function in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| and some of the challenges and accomplishments that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| One of them is adoption of 2012 codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| I think that's been a tremendously challenging process this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| because there's some pretty dramatic changes in 2012 codes, especially from the energy side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| And we've also implemented a residential planned review process started May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| And that would add in, too, would be the 2012, on the 2012 codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| That's significant, I think, for the city in that along with all these codes and options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| we were dealing with the ISO ratings for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| And that really initiated our code adoption process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| because our ratings came back from ISO pretty dismal if we just stayed where we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| I would be happy to report to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| And I know the mayor's already got notification of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I hope I'm not bragging before I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| But our ratings came back as a four, both for commercial and residential, which is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| That's a big bang for our buck at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| To get anything any better, it's just some things that we would have to budget for, more training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| Just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| We learned a lot about our ISO ratings this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5407)|
| 1:30:16| I really don't have anything other to say for the sake of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| We've got some new requirements in our planned review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Fires added and is receiving an electronic copy of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5425)|
| 1:30:36| That's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| I think a lot of our planned review is going electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| And we're also initiating a fee to be initiated at planned review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| And this has to do with Jim's engineering, and it's a notice of coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| This has to do with them approving from state level the site preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| So we're going to start requiring that fee at planned review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| So that notice is being going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Hopefully that will run pretty smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Tom, I guess some of the new codes went into place in May, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| We adopted them effective about six months out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| and I was just curious how are the engineers and the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| and the developers adapting to the new kinds of submissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| or information that you're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| So far it's went very smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| We had an influx, I think, of permits to get to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| the reviews to be submitted before they took effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| especially on the residential side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| But there was a few submittals before the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| that were requested to be reviewed in 2012 code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| They went very smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| And it will be a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| The industry is kind of growing with the codes, and they're getting used to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| The industry is growing with the codes, getting used to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| complying under the new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| Is that what you're seeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| And, I mean, really what I've seen during the adoption process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| on the commercial side, there was not a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| There was some concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| But on the residential side, there was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| because that market is very sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| But, fortunately, in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| most of our permits and our reviews are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| Not a lot of single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| I think we've seen a lot of we've seen more than other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| permitting a multifamily, however, apartment buildings and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Tom, now that we've implemented, I assume, the same codes, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Have we leveled the playing field, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Are our inspections similar to theirs or vice versa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| so that the complaints or the concerns I've heard over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| about the difficulty of developing in the city versus outside the city are now equalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| I'm trying to figure out where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Well, I think really and drearily we took care of that when we adopted 2006 International Building Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| There was a concerted effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| And I heard this being chief building inspector for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| The county did it this way or the county done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| And Roy Braden would hear the same thing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| The city done it this way or the city done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| I think there was an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| And we also tried to include Farragut, but they sometimes did and sometimes didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5644)|
| 1:34:12| I'll just say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| But, anyway, I think when we adopted the 2012 as we did when we did the 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| there was much collaboration between the two building officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| At that time, that was Gary Norman and Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| This time it was myself and Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| We actually scrutinized the amendments that we made to the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| so that we would be adopting the very same code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| Now, our inspection process is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| We're a multidisciplinary inspection bureau, which means we have building inspectors, plumbing inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| mechanical inspectors, and electrical inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| The county does not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| The county does not have electrical inspectors at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| They have multidisciplinary inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| They have one inspector that goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| We're different in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| As you folks know, I have personal knowledge, especially working with the city inspections and the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| One thing, Tom, as you and I have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| is that I know you're going to have some key personnel that are on track to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| And I just wanted to know from the standpoint of how you're planning ahead in terms of replacing those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5730)|
| 1:35:38| You folks have been, to me, extremely service-oriented in terms of helping with both the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| and the contractors in terms of the building inspections and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| I think you all do a great job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| But can you speak to the fact that in the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| you are going to see some of the key older people leaving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| Does it take two new ones to make one fellow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Well, the administration is very aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| and I've made the administration very aware of what's going to happen in the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| in the Building Inspection Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| During this year, there's been some unforeseen things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| Of course, the need of cash left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| It left a huge void, I think, in our department from the standpoint of just historical history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5780)|
| 1:36:30| the history of what has went on in the department and then actually what went on in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| and the people involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| And then recently, we've had some sickness in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| And that left a void for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| Scott Brenneman is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| He's a sign inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| But there for a while, we had about ten weeks where our zoning coordinator of many years was gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5813)|
| 1:37:03| and our sign inspector for many years was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| We have hired back a key person, I think, in Scott Elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| Scott is doing a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I brag on him all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| I hope that doesn't come back to bite me one of these days, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| He's very knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| He comes from the sign industry, which was a key for us when we hired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| I don't think I realized at the time we hired him that he had as much knowledge about the sign industry that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| But that's something I know that council is dealing with part of the zoning ordinance that deals with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| I know you're dealing with that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| I think that's going to be a great hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| And we're replacing him as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| That was another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Two other things that I wanted to ask questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| When was the last time the permit fees were raised, like on signage also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| Well, it's odd that you would ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Chevelle Lewis, and I didn't recognize Chevelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| She's in the audience as well as Robert Clark, our administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| I like to call him our controller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| But, anyway, it's been ten years since our building inspection fees have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| and our sign fees have never been raised that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| That was my understanding, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart3?start=5901)|
