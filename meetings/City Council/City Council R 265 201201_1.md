| 1:54:39| and meeting the requirements of Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| and Fair Labor Standards Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| so that's why that amendment is in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| and again, the unfilled positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| are often used at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| if there are overages and large overages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| in other areas of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| and I will turn it over to the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| to talk more about what the on-call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| what those officers do in the IA unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| Well, actually, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| I had another question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| about the reno's to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| the COVID-related renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| It concerns me whenever I see air filtration systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| and I see the word ionization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| and it makes me wanna hear more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| because I've done some research into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| and there are very few systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| that can help mitigate the effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| and some seem to be a wasted investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| and so I'm curious to learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Yeah, and I'm glad that Ms. Burrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| I see that she's still on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| so she can chime in here in just a second as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| if she's still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| but I had the same skepticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| when this was first brought to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| obviously, I've been involved in facilities maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| and management and public works for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| and there are lots of air filtration systems out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| that maybe don't perform the way that they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| I asked those same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Ms. Burrett came in and presented that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| to the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| The county also had questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| but we all feel comfortable that this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| based on the documents that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| and the information and the guarantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| that we see are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| and I think, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| the COVID and the impacts of air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| especially in office settings and meeting rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| is something that we feel obligated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| to attempt to address through this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| both here and at the public works building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| which is our other large facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| and potentially other buildings down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| but Ms. Burrett, would you like to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| just a little bit about the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| that we've reviewed, both the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| We have used this bionization system in several facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| including the county forensics facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| We have found that even on COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| it shows proof of 70% filtration against this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| It also treats against mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| There's about 17 different items that it works against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| Now, something like the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| it has an old mongeline system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Putting this unit on it, it's a one-time expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| We work with our current merge filters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| and that does the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| It's a one-time cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| but we feel the value is there with the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| and all the other items that it can address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| and we do have proof in other facilities it has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| I'm happy to share some information further with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| if that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| I would like additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| because I'm curious when you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| we have found a 70% effectiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| have you tested it against COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| or what do you mainly say you have found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| It's through engineers and architects that it's been tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| and we do have some information from the companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| we've used where they have those test results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| on all the different systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| So, I mean, I can share that with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| if that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| We could send the information on this system out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| if you'd like to, all of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| and provide the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| And then my last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| was about the employee bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| I appreciate that the bonuses include general employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| but when Director Brice said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| the folks who keep our city moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| I immediately thought of our bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| And I wanted to ask, what is possible for our bus drivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| I have the same thought, Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| and Ms. Gill, why don't you share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| what the county's planning to do, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| So, thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| I think we all very much recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| that CAT drivers are very much on the front lines of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| as you said, moving the city forward and keeping it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| Just based on how the budgeting is structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| they do not need to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| into this budget amendment itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| However, Director Thorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| we have been in touch with him throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| as we've been planning for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| and making sure he's aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| such that if and when Council completes its two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| of this budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| that CAT would also then receive a comparable bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| through their own payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7188)|
| 1:59:56| Okay, thank you for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Those are all of my questions, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Okay, thank you to all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| who've been helping answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Are there any further questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| would you please come back to roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7211)|

| 2:00:53| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7253)|

| 2:00:59| and donating same to the Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| to support its efforts to secure internet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| for local K through 12 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| Motion made to approve by Councilmember Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| seconded by Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Sorry, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| Councilmembers, I appreciate your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| of the ENOX initiative when I first spoke with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| about the city's pledge several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| The pandemic, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| has underscored the critical need for high-quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| reliable internet access as a core utility for families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| and especially students participating in virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| So filling that gap is a long-term challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| but fortunately, there's a committed group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| of community leaders who came together earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| to figure out a quick solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| to provide quality internet access to every child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| in the K through 12 school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| and enable online meeting for the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| So thank you for your commitment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| The city doesn't oversee schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| but as you know, we all care very deeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| about the education of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| and that is our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| So I want to thank Amy Nolan of the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| and Chris Letzos with the Knoxville Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| for both on the call today to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| and provide information about ENOX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| And also, I want to thank all the partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| working with ENOX to make this work possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| So thank you for joining this important effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| And I'm confident that Councilmembers are supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| but I just wanted to give a little overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| of what this means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| we first talked about it a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| and it's just now coming to the actual budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| Any questions on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| I just wanted to comment how important this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| At Pellissippi, one of the biggest reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| that we have people that withdraw is internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| And so I am excited at the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| that KEB is having about this being a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| future public utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| It's very difficult to provide it as a one by one service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| We've attempted to do that at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| There's just a lot of barriers and problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| to doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| So we will do better as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| and be able to get people plugged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| and be able to sustain and meet their education goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| a lot better when we have reliable internet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| So I look forward to the day that we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| And I appreciate Knox Education's work on this front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| because this is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| for people meeting their education goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| Any further, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I just want to applaud this ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| I wanted to ask, we've already made a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| from the city already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Do we foresee that this will stretch us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| to the end of the school year in terms of access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Mr. Latsos, would you start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| and the address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| Chris Latsos, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| I'm the CEO of the Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| I want to begin, again, by thanking the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| and her team and Amy Nolan and the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| It's been a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| And to answer your question, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| or City Councilmember Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| we think we'll get through the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| Currently, we have about 700 students that we're supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| Every day, we get a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Navigating it has been the biggest challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| Believe it or not, through some of the caseworkers on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| in particular, our community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| coordinators, just under 60 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| we're supporting and finding alternative access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| So to Councilwoman Ryder's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| I think it's critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| What's coming out of these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| are opportunities for collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| to address internet needs in targeted communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| And we've worked with various partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| including KCBC, to identify their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| where we can begin and then roll this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| to greater numbers of students for lower prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| But yes, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| we think we can end this school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| between the city's commitment, the county's commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| and the United Way of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| which stepped up first with a challenge grant of $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| I've spoken with a number of principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| throughout the county, and they're all discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| I'm grateful for it, but also to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| Mr. Aletso's discussing what conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| this is opening related to long-term needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| So cheers to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| Council Member Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| Yeah, just briefly, I'd like to underline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| Councilperson Ryder's comment about continuing discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| with KUB and see what kind of ideas that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| as far as kind of fixing this patchwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| And frankly, inadequate system we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| as far as providing internet access to everyone who needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| So these are important conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| and I look forward to continuing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7571)|

| 2:07:21| like it outreaches the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7641)|

| 2:07:33| to show his face after I know for a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7653)|

| 2:07:58| Y'all are hilarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| And then you have a police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| that has been caught numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7683)|

| 2:08:12| Didn't we give them 60 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| They better find a way to spend 60 million then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| And it does not mean keep dipping back into our tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| that we adamantly need for our public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7699)|

| 2:08:28| because you was one of their primary advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| for giving them money constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7709)|

| 2:08:43| And yet people sit around and act like it's not happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| and do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| I'm looking forward to election next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7728)|

| 2:08:56| because that is definitely gonna happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| I am looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7738)|

| 2:09:03| from the public wanting to get you up out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| The reality is that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| as Amelia Parker stayed being true to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| stayed being loyal to her people that voted her there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| stayed understanding that she is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| because representation does matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| and she must be that voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| informing us of 40 plus million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| that we have available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7762)|

| 2:09:31| This is insanity, is what we have watched happen here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| Again, stop applauding yourselves for mediocrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| because that's what you are, mediocre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Every last one of you, except for Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| She has been the only one time and time again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| that stood up for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| And I really find it funny, Indica Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| that you can't stand up to her by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| You gotta bring three of your cabinet members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| to handle a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| that you should have all the answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| So the question is, who's the puppet on the strings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| Is it you or David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| I'm still trying to figure it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| because I really can't tell at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| because it looks like David has your strings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| wrapped around his fingers and got you dance, dance, dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| But as I said before, elections are always available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Indica Cannon, we gotta exercise our constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| and recall you up out of here ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| And the reality is that we will find people representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Your loyalty is not to the Republican Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| Your loyalty is not to the Democratic Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| Your loyalty is not to capitalism and dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| Your loyalty is to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| who voted you into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Those taxpayers, those frontline workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| who work day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| busting their butts to make those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| and paying those tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| that you see her abuse and misappropriate constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| That is who your loyalty is to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| And at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| you all have failed on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| I yield my time to this disgusting council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7849)|

| 2:10:54| Because the way you all perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| is barf on barf and vomit on vomit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| I cannot stand it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7858)|

| 2:11:10| because they need to see this for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-counncil-r-265-201201?start=7870)|
