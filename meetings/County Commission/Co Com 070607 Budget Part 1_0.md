| 0:01:06| Commissioner Huddleston, Commissioner Green, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=66)|
| 0:01:10| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Okay, we have 14 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=71)|
| 0:01:21| I guess Chief of Staff, Mr. Arms, the Mayor is not going to be able to attend, or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| about Mr. Warner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=89)|
| 0:01:38| About Mr. Weitrich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| He's in South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| He told us earlier he was flying back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| All right, I guess if the Commission wants to, if we don't have people here that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=101)|
| 0:01:56| answer the questions, we'll let the public speak, and if we have any questions, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| we'll probably have to have something another night before next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| If we can't have the people here to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| So I guess, Frances Fogerson, if you'd like to go first, and then we can just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=131)|
| 0:02:22| I'm Frances Fogerson, Director of Human Resources for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| One important element of the budget to be considered is employee raises, and it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| not only because of the dollar amount, but because of the number of people that it impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| And I know that there have been various scenarios for employee raises that have been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| and many of those have quite an impact on our compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| And I wanted to have the opportunity to explain to you what some of those scenarios would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| do to the compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| First of all, I want you to recognize that we have an established compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| It's been in place since about 2001, was developed by, with the assistance of a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| consultant, and that is Dr. Lou Rabinowitz, who happens to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| When we developed this system, we had representatives from many different offices, even some outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| of the mayor's departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Want you to know that that consisted of the participants were from various levels, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| just management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| We worked about a year on it and developed a system that has pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=221)|
| 0:03:50| We have actually 37 pay grades in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| So various job titles fit within specific pay grades as they are graded on what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| compensable factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| This group decided what particular elements, if a position required more of it or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| of it, would impact the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| We have factors such as experience, duty complexity, leadership, the effect of errors, communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| a number of factors like that play into deciding what particular pay grade a job has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| And then an employee can increase their pay as they move through various steps within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| a pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Pay grades are set for the position and not the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| And we also have a set of coordinating guidelines that manage starting salaries and performance-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| periodic increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| So what I want you to understand is we have a pretty sophisticated and well-established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Be aware that the sheriff's department has a very similar compensation system, developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| at about the same time with the assistance of the same professional consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| So when I indicate to you that certain scenarios will have an adverse impact on our compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| system, it would have the same impact on pay grades for the sheriff's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| One thing that's been suggested in various formats is drawing a line across our salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| and giving one percentage increase to employees who have less than a certain figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| and then giving perhaps a lesser percentage increase to employees above that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| That line's been suggested to be 40,000, 45,000, various scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| What I'd like for you to understand clearly is that you can't draw a line cleanly across our compensation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=357)|
| 0:06:06| if you name a dollar point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| So if you suggest that we give a different raise to people that are under, for example, 45,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| and you try to draw the line across our systems, it becomes a stair-stepped line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| So that there are some people within a particular pay grade who would be eligible for the higher percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| increase and some people sitting in exactly the same pay grade, perhaps with exactly the same job title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| who would not be eligible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| What it does is it creates an advantage for a person who has been here less amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=405)|
| 0:06:55| So persons in the lower, who are paid lower amounts, typically are people who have been here less time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| In the scenario of giving a greater increase to employees that make less than 45,000 in our particular system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=424)|
| 0:07:15| for example, at pay grade 23, only the person in step one would be eligible for the higher raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| All other people would only be eligible for the lower percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| That means that the person that's been here less than six months might perhaps get a 4% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| while people that have been here greater than six months would only rate a 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| So I'm saying there would be quite a disadvantage to the person with greater longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| And that would be played out in a number, actually the whole middle section of our compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| So anything that gives an unequal percentage will have a disadvantage to an employee that has been here a greater length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=481)|
| 0:08:13| It also actually has a significant adverse impact to our compensation system overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=493)|
| 0:08:22| This system was designed to be equitable, to be fair, to be rational, to provide growth for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=502)|
| 0:08:32| to progress to either higher pay grades or to progress in steps over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| We do have a system where we require that an employee have a satisfactory job performance rating on their annual evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=519)|
| 0:08:49| in order to qualify for steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| But with an adequate performance, when money is available, and over in the last few years we've been able to give step raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| there is opportunity for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| But I'd like for you to understand that any system of raises that you suggest that divides employees into two separate categories based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=544)|
| 0:09:13| upon a salary point will have a significant adverse impact to our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| It will essentially impact the equity of the entire system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=560)|
| 0:09:30| If you would ask me to suggest what would be a fair thing to do in terms of raises, it's to use the system that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=570)|
| 0:09:40| It is fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| It has been peer reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Multiple departments use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| So if you're going to suggest a percentage increase, I would greatly recommend that it be the same percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=588)|
| 0:09:57| an equal percentage to all persons within our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| I met, I think, day before yesterday with representatives from the sheriff's system as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Chief Spangler and Bivens, and we clearly came to the conclusion that the unequal percentage suggestions have exactly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=612)|
| 0:10:23| same impact on their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And they would not recommend such a system of increases as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| So that's my statement, is that we have a well-established, fair, equitable, rational system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| and unequal percentages will have a significant adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| I just want to tell you I agree with you totally, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| I think that what you're suggesting is a fair and equitable way, and I think we need to stay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| The question that I have for you, the raise given this year, is that about what has been given every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| The two percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Or is it substantially lower than in other years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| It's not substantially lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| The last two years it was a three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Last year we received three percent plus a step where employees were eligible for that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| And let me tell you that in our system of 13 steps across any pay grade, there is a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| and for us it's step nine that we consider market value, that employees hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| They receive a pay increase only every third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| So those in the lower paid steps, you know, under that system would get an increase every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| while those in the higher paid categories receive a salary increase only every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| That makes more money available for those at lower pay grade or lower steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| But, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| You have this document here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Would you mind to explain for the sake of clarity, at least for me, under the 152,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| underneath that line, what those three numbers, three columns under it represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| The 635.8, the 530, then the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| Do I have the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| At the bottom, the additional bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| In description number eight, that indicates if you give a $500 bonus, you know, what the total would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=766)|
| 0:12:58| The $635,872 would be for those employees under the county mayor system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| The 530,000 would be for those employees under the sheriff's system, compensation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| because they have a slightly different system from us, and then the total of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| So adding a bonus, an individual bonus, does not have an adverse impact to the compensation system that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=800)|
| 0:13:30| because that's a one-time payment that's essentially off the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| So, in a sense, that column that you're talking about, if they have a 2 percent, and as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| another $500 lump sum, that would be really equivalent to 2 percent, a $1,000 lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| That would be the additional funding for the $500 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| I'm not sure I understand, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| It says additional bonus, $500 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Several scenarios that have been suggested have been a percentage increase plus an additional bonus to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=841)|
| 0:14:11| And that cost that's indicated there is the expense we would incur just for giving the bonus, the one-time $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| Okay. Is that above the 2 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| And at 2 percent plus 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Yes, you need to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| If you give just 2 percent to all employees, you'll find that under line three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=867)|
| 0:14:37| With the total of $1,854,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| And should you decide to give a one-time bonus in addition, you would need to add the additional cost for the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| But that's why it's on the table now, 2 percent plus $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Okay. Frances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| There are some employees who I guess are not covered under a step raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| So right now, if you give a step raise, what happens to those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| They don't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| There are some employees, if money were available to give a step increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| under the guidelines that we have, there are some employees who would not receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| No, I'm saying, ma'am, there's some people that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| I don't think Allison, maybe Allison can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=930)|
| 0:15:40| I think there's some employees that are not even, I mean, they don't get steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| So what happens to those employees if we give 2 percent in a step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| They would just receive the 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Are those individuals the higher paid in the sheriff's office or more lower paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| It's a range from lower to higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| It's just a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| But they would not receive a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| You know, we have appointed positions in the sheriff's office that some start out, you know, mid-20s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| And then we have appointed positions that are over $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| So it is a range from the low to the higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| You know how many, do you have a number of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Probably about 80 to 100 positions just for our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Would be appointed positions, those that just receive a percentage that are not on the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Frances, do you know of employees, general government employees that don't have step increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| Those that would not have step increases would be employees that either did not receive a satisfactory score on their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Or those that are at step 9 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| And they only get that every third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| And it might not be their year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| But what I'm asking is every employee in general government is on a pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| I mean, we don't have employees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Yeah, I was going to say part-time interns, certain employees like that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:20| What I'm getting at is I don't want to see us give 2% in a step raise and then there's some employees that only get 2% because they're not in a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:30| The position they're in just doesn't have a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| But you're saying there's no people like that in general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| There are in the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I can say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| For those that use this compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| I just want to make sure there wasn't any in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| I'm not talking about other office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Interns, temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Yes, Frances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| What percent, I guess it probably varies from one step to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| It's not an exact percentage raise, but what's that sort of average out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| What if we just gave, if we're just talking about the percentage of a step, what's that sort of average out to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| It's a different percent for the lower steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:34| I don't have that information readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| However, I will tell you that from step nine and above, it's a greater amount, and, therefore, that's why they hold for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:48| I mean, when we say that we're going to get, if we say we give a step plus 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| I mean, we don't know what that sort of comes out to being percentagely, what kind of raise the average employee got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| About five to five and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| We can't hear you, Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Again, this year we're not recommending a step, but you can get an order of magnitude by looking at one of these lines that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| for instance, an additional 2% under $45,000 is about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| Go to the next line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| An additional 2% plus a step for that same category is 1,134,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| So you can see that that step more than doubles what a 2% raise would be for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Do you follow my reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Well, I see the top line says an additional step for all employees is 3.3 million, almost 3.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:57| For all employees, if they got a 2%, it was 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| That's nearly half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So I guess a step is worth almost 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| Like you said, a little over 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| It depends on where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Well, it depends on where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| I'm just, you know, the average employee should be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I mean, there's going to be ranges on the low end and the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| If you're getting to the middle, you're probably looking at a little better than a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| And one reason, just when we looked at that $500 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| we knew a $500 bonus for an employee making $20,000 has been a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| I mean, a $500 bonus is an additional 2% for someone in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| So that was the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| You know, I know the mayor wanted to give more than 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| He didn't want to have a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| So that's why we went with that $500, because that helps the lower paid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| And it's a one-time shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| And it didn't skew the classification system moving forward, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| I just sort of see this as a, especially for those in lower end and lower steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| if they're already below market, and they're not getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| and they're only getting 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| and it just seems like they fall behind a little bit more for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| At least that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Can we respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| I'm Lou Rabinowitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| I'm the president and CEO of PTG Organizational Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| We're the firm that set up the pay system for Knox County in 2000 to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| And a point that I'd like to make is that the system is updated every couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| using salary surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| And salary surveys are distributed to other county and municipal governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| and data is collected to find out what the market actually pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| So if any adjustments need to be made to any positions, midpoints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| they're made based on those salary surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| So when you say that people in lower grades are not being paid at market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:20| that's not accurate because every couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| the system is updated using the salary survey data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| Well, you just said step nine was market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Step nine is the midpoint based on what the market is paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| So there are people in the market who get paid significantly less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| and people who get paid significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| If you look at a pay range, the midpoint is the midpoint of what the market is actually paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| As a matter of fact, Knox County's pay system is based on actual pay in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| not on pay ranges, which makes Knox County very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Maybe you can answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| What's the market bearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| How much of a raise are employees making generally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| It depends on whether you're talking publicly funded or private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| I think if you look at the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| two percent is probably what a lot of the county municipal governments are going to be able to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| And privately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Three, three and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| And it depends on the type of position, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| On this right here, the additional step, all employees, when you go down to the additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| this two percent that you have in the budget for this year, I guess, Mr. Arms or Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:51| this additional, are we talking about money that you already have budgeted, the two percent plus the five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| This money is already in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Now, if we start talking down this line here, it's an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| This is on top of what's in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| On top of what's already been budgeted that you all have presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| If we go to additional two percent, that's four percent that they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I want to make, I want an understanding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| We talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| It was my understanding, and I asked this very question, and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| and I understand what you're saying, different people's steps, that there's different increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| But I thought it was my understanding that people on the low to middle end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| the $20,000 to $25,000 salary, a step equaled approximately $620 to $640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Is that not, am I correct or incorrect, Ms. Fogerson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I would have to take a couple of samples and do the calculation, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| Are we freezing, according to the proposal, are we freezing that step this year, or are we giving that step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| That's what I'm also wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| There's no step being given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| We were freezing the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| The original proposal had no step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| This is for Dr. Rabinowitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Let me see if I understand this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Every couple of years, the salaries are looked at again and looked at the market value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| and those ranges can be adjusted up, I assume, and anyone who was in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| say, the fourth or fifth sector of that range, even though they didn't change their sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| they could receive an automatic increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Typically, if a job has to be reclassified, it's put into a different pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| So, for instance, you know, jobs are pretty volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| You have to look at what the market's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| A couple of years ago, you're all well aware that IT-type jobs, computer jobs, were very volatile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| and that market drove the pay for IT jobs way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| When we did our first salary survey for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| the big area that needed to be corrected was pharmacists because Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| had traditionally competed with hospitals for pharmacists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| but all of a sudden, every block in Knoxville had a CVS and a Walgreens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and that drove the market up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| So those jobs had to be corrected and reclassified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| So typically, jobs aren't moved within the same pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| If a correction has to be made, the job is typically reclassified into a new pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| So the person would actually go into a different job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Not a different job, a different pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| The job would be reclassified into a different pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Based on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1611)|
| 0:27:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Dr. Lou Rabino-Witz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Do you have some other comments you want to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| I'd just like to echo what Ms. Fogerson said, Dr. Fogerson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| In order to maintain the integrity of the pay system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| I think the best approach is to do an across-the-board percentage increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| freeze the steps, but move the entire pay range, whatever percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| If it's 2%, 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Do we have any questions for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| Mr. Michael Barnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| I'm Michael Barnes, Executive Director of the East Tennessee Television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| I want to thank the commission for their support in the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I would like to make it a point also, as many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| the Film Commission is here to help promote and grow the television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| and film industry here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| The Lions Student Audiovisual Festival, which we started this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| as an educational program to help develop our young people for future workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| had 19 Knox County teams, delivered 21 film projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| with 127 students participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| The overall winning team from Central High School won $85,000 in scholarships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| from three Tennessee colleges and universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| That same team went on to Nashville to have their material shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| at the Nashville Film Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| And next week, a couple of the students from that team are going to New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| to pick up an award at Carnegie Hall in the National Academic Achievement Art Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| This from a project that started right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I'd like to emphasize that we did, the Film Commission did go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and solicit some sponsorship dollars to offset some of the direct costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Between April 2006 and May 2007, our commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| which is comprised of two staff people, has supported 21 productions in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| resulting in 303 hotel room nights, 325 crew jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| and slightly over $2,400,000 in economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| Currently, we have two productions, which showed up in yesterday's paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| working in our area, and we're working on several other prospects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| to bring them here to film in and around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| This means jobs to these people that are here in our industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| and it's important that we go ahead and continue to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| All of what I have mentioned was accomplished on a budget of $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| with a $20,000 supplement that was given to us this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| The additional $20,000 we requested for our operational budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| will allow us to carry on this pattern of economic success in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| We would appreciate any additional funding Knox County would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Again, thank you for your support of the East Tennessee Television and Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I'll answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Yeah, I've got a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| and I want to say up front I'm a strong supporter of the Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Film and television is one of the fastest growing industries in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and for a community of this size with as much video and film production that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| we really need to be behind this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| I want to ask you, I know last year you got $90,000 initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Did you get any money after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I said we had gotten a $20,000 supplement, which helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| So in actuality, when you look at the budget where you requested, I think, what, $115,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| If you look in our budget book, it looks like he's asking for $25,000 more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| because in the last year's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| the budget doesn't tell you that they gave him an additional $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| So essentially, if we go at $90,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| we're cutting this gentleman's budget by $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| You know, he's not asking for a $20,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| He's simply asking for what he got last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And one thing, I'm not quite sure why this is being handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| but I have a list of credit card charges made by various county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| Not sure what the purpose is, but I notice here there's a stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| it looks like a one-night stay in Hollywood, California, for $917.58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| And it was not a film commission employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| It was a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| What I'm wondering is, do you have a travel budget if you needed to send someone to California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| to try to get a film to come to this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Do you even have a travel budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I have a regional travel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| I do not have sufficient funding at this time to make a long-stay trip to California to try to sell anything, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| So the $115,000 that you asked for is not even asking for a travel budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| which I think is something that may be very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| It looks to me like what you've done in your request at the level of $115,000 is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| you knew this was going to be a tight year, and you weren't asking for anything extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| I mean, you trimmed the budget to the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| And I think this commission needs to give the film commission the $115,000 they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| We don't need to trim that budget further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| especially considering this is one of our fastest-growing growth industries in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| He's already trimmed his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| I don't think we need to trim it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I think we need to fund this at $115,000 and not at the $90,000 that the budget calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Do we have any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2025)|
| 0:34:02| I have one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| You're talking about operating budget that we fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| But you generate income of revenue of some sort, too, don't you, or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| We generated sponsorship dollars for ourselves last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| And then the other money that is generated through the commission actually is when we support productions coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| to the area, and those jobs then are created, and then it has an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| But, no, there's no direct profit money coming to the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| I want to really emphasize the films that these students made were absolutely amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| I'm going to actually try to get the rights to one of these films on skateboarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| to help sell my community on a skate park that I'm wanting to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| And the thing that was amazing about it was these were not extremely wealthy kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| These were middle class kids that might not have gotten an opportunity to, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| they may not have ever found the career that they wanted to pursue, much less found the funding to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:25| And I just think it would be really tragic if the film commission doesn't have the funds they need to put this project on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| Well, we also, I want to add something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| We are currently looking at some other prospects coming here to our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| I'm not making any promises, but we can't fish for the prospects if we are not funded appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| And I would like to stress that because it means jobs, it means economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| It is about dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I came from the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| I understand what it takes to get things going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| And we know now that we're fighting with the incentives and we have the governor's support behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| We now have a $20 million fund, not for our use, but to help develop projects coming into the state from out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:17| and also to help grow our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| I'd like to make one other thing an invitation, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| There's a film that you all know is filming here right now called Quick Feet, Soft Hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| being directed by Paul Harrell, who won the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| I've been authorized to extend an invitation to all of you to the set next Wednesday at UGO Bargain Barn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| between 10.15 and 12.00 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| I would like for you to come out and see what these people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Every bit of the crew is from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And it is some of our top people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you very much for the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Can you send something up to our office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Absolutely will do, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Any other questions for Mr. Barnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Mr. John Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Mr. Chairman, while he's coming up, Scott, who do we have from administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| Who's answering these questions for us from administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Mr. Warner's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I mean, as these questions come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| We've got John Troyer and Cynthia Finch and Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| I mean, if somebody has something to say, I want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I want to hear both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I want to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Mr. Arms, you have to talk into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| We cannot hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| I mean, what I'm curious about is somebody says something about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| what Mr. Lambert was saying here, and somebody has a response to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I want to hear what that response is about cutting this guy's budget short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| I'm interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Thirty-second response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| This year, when we look at grants, we tried to hold every grant to what it was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| So we were holding what it was last year, and in a few cases, we gave another $1,000 or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| mostly on the request of county commissioners who said, this is a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Can you add $1,000 or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| So if you look at that whole list, it's almost frozen from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Last year, I think we gave the FEMA Commission $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| And during the year, we came back to Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| and asked for a bump for what we thought was a one-time project, this FEMA Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| And it is a good, I mean, the FEMA project, and it was a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So that did, in fact, bump it up another $15,000 or $20,000 compared to the original request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| I think the mayor thought it was a one-time bump-up, a one-time bump-up for a one-time project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| But we're not here trying to discourage the funding of any of these nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| You know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| You know how much money they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| The one thing we have encouraged, and Cynthia even has a program for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| we've encouraged the nonprofits to go out and find other sustainable forms of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| instead of being the Knox County taxpayer every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| So we haven't tried to encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| So you'll see some of these organizations may only be getting 10 percent of their funding from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| or 90 percent, but we're encouraging them to find new sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| Also, Commissioners, along with Mr. Arms' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| what you don't know is that the Department of Community Development and Grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| we are continuously working with our community grants partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| We provide technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| We identify grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| We help them have ongoing dialogue with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| If there's opportunities to identify dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| Corporate relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We are constantly opening doors for one-time projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Sometimes we think one-time projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Where my staff in the Community Development Department oftentimes works hand-in-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| with many of these community organizations to try to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Now, as you recall, when we had our public meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| I talked about what's coming soon is these sustainability workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| That means that we're going to be working with organizations at various levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Those organizations that have budgets of a million dollars or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| those from a million to 500,000 and then beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| they'll get particular technical assistance for these particular organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| And I think we'll be surprised in 2009 how we will be able to help these organizations move up to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| Ms. Finch, since you're up there, we might have a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| I just want to, Cynthia, you know, for 13 of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| this is our first time, so I don't know what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| So if you all ever need to educate us, tell us, you know, the other side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| That's what I want to hear, too. I want to hear both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Well, we'll be excited to possibly come and have a luncheon with all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| to talk about the grant process and all the exciting things we have that's coming forth in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| that talks about sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| If you do and watch the research about nonprofit organizations, yes, they do struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| But when you have a proactive department like our department who has gone beyond the call of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| in regards to technical assistance, actual physically writing grants, opening doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| developing corporate partnerships, and on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| I think you'll be really impressed with what's coming forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| And our partners will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Yes, Cynthia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| You know, in a lot of communities, the Film Commission is actually a part of local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| You know, I mean, they're almost a quasi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| In fact, the film industry looks at the Film Commission as an authority in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| Now, I understand asking folks to hold the line to what they had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| But actually, last year, since they got that $20,000 bump, their budget was actually $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| How would you feel about holding them at what they had last year and holding them at $110,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| And if Mr. Barnes is, is Mr. Barnes still in the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Mr. Barnes, you can just nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| How would you feel about sticking with last year's levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Can you do your job at $110,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I know it's $5,000 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Cynthia, how would you feel about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| What I would hope, Commissioner, is that you would allow us to do what we promised that we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| which is to work with these organizations hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| The proposed dollar amounts that we recommended, my staff has worked very closely with many of the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| Maybe we need to do a little closer work with the Film Commission to look at additional opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| So the $90,000 that we had recommended is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| I mean, I can understand the oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| If you didn't see the, you know, if you were looking at last year's budget and you didn't see the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| That was a one-time request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| But, I mean, it's essentially, you know, while other folks are frozen at last year's level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| the Film Commission, which, again, represents one of the fastest growing segments of the local economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| is being cut by $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| You know, and I can understand wanting to hold the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| but I really think we need to at least fund them at last year's levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| especially considering how many jobs the film and television industry is responsible for locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:49| Okay, Cynthia, I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| On the matching manners consortium, who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| I'd ask for something to be pulled, and I don't know if I've ever got it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| I think we did give that to, did we give that to you, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, I think that's miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Yes, it has been miscellaneous for initially when it was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| it was set up as an opportunity to develop consortiums to match up organizations with youth organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| And since that time, we have used that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| We applied for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| It was going to be served as a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| I think more or less it's a discretionary fund for their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Yes, and it has been used as match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| It has been used as an area where we'll be able to identify organizations that present themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| after the budget period that is requested match money, sometimes supply for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| But who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Is it Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| It's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| So there is no matching manners consortium as an organization nonprofit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| So why wouldn't we just have that in the budget of community development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Well, initially when it was set up, it was set up as an area where we would provide matching grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| matching resources to organizations when they were applying for federal grants, state grants, foundation grants, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| So who approves this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So if we need to recategorize it, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Who approves this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| My department, community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| So we approve it thinking it goes to matching manners consortium when, in fact, during the year, you all could send it wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| Is that what you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Well, not necessarily wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I'm thinking Mr. Wallace has all the organizations that this particular grant has been used for as far as matching grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| as small projects that are presented that do not meet a lot of the criteria that's for a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Marvin Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| I'm Marv Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I'm the president and CEO of the Hallsdale Power Utility District located out in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| We serve 27,000 households from west of Powell to east of Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| And in my seven years of employment with Hallsdale Powell, I've had the privilege of working with a number of county departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| and other entities that you folks provide funding for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| And I want to tell you that we're blessed to have some wonderful departments within county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| that I think that they deserve your continued support and even hopefully expanded support in the days and years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| There's about four or five different entities or departments that my utility works with that I consider almost essential to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| and beginning with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| My utility does some things behind the scenes with the Sheriff's Department with neighborhood watches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| to make sure that our neighborhoods are safe and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| We have a very positive relationship with the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| and I have a deep appreciation for what those folks go through with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| The same holds true with the Department of Public Works and Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| Those folks are really faced with some tough, tough days ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| And you folks are also faced with some tough days ahead when it comes to stormwater ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and things that are very, very unpopular for people because it's going to require some funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| either in the form of fees or some other type of funding to support these federally mandated programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| And you folks are going to have to be kind of like my three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| You're going to have to have ice water in your veins and a steel rod in your back and do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Or you're going to face, as I was talking to Commissioner Kaywood a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| the last thing you want is a federal inquiry to come in here, a Justice Department inquiry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| by snubbing your nose at the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| And I know you're not going to, but you're faced with a lot of very serious dilemmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| And I have a great appreciation for all of you for what you're having to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| I know that almost everyone in this room has a special interest or a special agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| special program or project that they're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| And I'm the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Economic development is very dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And we're one of the few utilities in this area that earmarked funds for the Jobs Now campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| with this chamber partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| And I would encourage your continued support for this vital program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| which is just a tremendously important program for all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| and not just Knox County, but for this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| We need to continue the support for that, and hopefully expanded support even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And also the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| I can't say enough positive things about Mark and Mark Jones and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Ronnie Neese and all those folks over there that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Out of sight, out of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| You very seldom ever hear anything about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| But I'm telling you, folks, that's a very, very important department for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| And I encourage you to do, and I know you're going to do what's right for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| and for the citizenry of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| But these things are very dear to me and dear to my utility district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| And I know that you hate to make decisions that impact the pocketbooks of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| But sometimes we have to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Organizational psychologists tell us that we're now in an entitlement era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| Folks think that they're entitled to a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| And with entitlements come the responsibility of coming up with the funds to pay for those entitlements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| that folks think that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| And they may deserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| But you folks are kind of sitting in the hot seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| And I appreciate each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| And I thank you for all the good things that have happened during my seven years at Halls Del Pal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| New schools, two new libraries, new parks, just a lot of great things going on in my part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| And I know that it's widespread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| It's in South Knox County and West Knox County and East Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| But I speak for North Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| We appreciate you and for the funding that you've provided for all these projects that enhance the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| for the citizens at our end of the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I do support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| I think it's a fair budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| I also think that there's some areas we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I guess I'm probably one of the few people in this room that advocates a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| But I know that it's not wise from my perspective at my utility because I've inherited a utility that deferred action on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| And now my rate payers are paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| And you can't keep deferring debt year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| And somebody along the way is going to have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| And it's a very unpopular decision that you folks are going to be saddled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| But, again, I appreciate you and appreciate all the funding that you've provided for the projects in North Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| that allow our folks to enjoy their lifestyles, enjoy living in our part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you, Marvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I know you serve on the Stormwater Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Whatever, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Do you all have a figure of what that will cost Knox County over a ten-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| I mean, I hear numbers up to $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Scott, I've heard the same thing, and I apologize for not bringing that information with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| But it is an astronomical amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| And those figures you heard are probably pretty doggone close over a ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| And we don't know how it's going to be funded yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| A lot of counties, nearby counties, Blount County for one, Maryville, Blount County, they have a stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| They assess fees depending on how much impervious surface you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| That's how much roof you have, how much asphalt you have that drains off into a tributary somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| And it applies to a lot of folks besides residential taxpayers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| It applies to shopping centers and churches and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| Watershed management, folks, I tell you, is going to be an emerging issue all across the nation that people are going to be saddled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| And we're right on the front of the curve, so to speak, here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| It's going to be costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| But, Scott, you're hearing some figures that's probably going to be pretty accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| Is that moving forward, or are we going to have to fix some things that's in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| Oh, I think we're going to have to fix some things that's occurred in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| And it's kind of like I mentioned to you and Larry and Sharon and Mr. Lambert and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| all four of you know what we're saddled with at my utility because of EPA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| We're saddled with about $144 million in capital projects that we're going to have to upgrade our wastewater plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| and everything that we're polluting the streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| upgrading our sewer collection systems that we're allowing the illegal sewer overflows to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| just like our neighbors at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| And KUB is doing a great job of addressing those things in the city and in their service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| And we're trying to do the same thing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| But all these things are federally mandated by the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| And, as I said a while ago, the last thing you want to see coming, and I'll let you have an appreciation of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| is see a U.S. Department of Justice representative walk in with a federal inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| to talk to you about why you haven't addressed these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| And, you know, you folks don't have, you really, you've got a millstone around your neck, I'm telling you, with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| And it's going to be an issue that's going to be on the table for years and years to come for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| And it's kind of like I've inherited, you know, why did you keep deferring things, action on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:47| and why did you keep putting money in the bank rather than putting it in infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Why did you not do these things to make sure this utility infrastructure was maintained properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3231)|
| 0:54:00| so that future generations of ratepayers wouldn't have to be saddled with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Well, you folks are facing the very same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Of course, Knox County, and I'll speak in defense of the Public Works Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| they just haven't got the type of funds that it takes to maintain all these detention basins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| and all these stormwater apparatuses that have to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| Facilities have to be improved and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| And they just haven't had the personnel and the sources of revenue to do what needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| So I'll speak in defense of the Public Works Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Leuthold, you may have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| This is not a question. This is a comment I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| I'd like to thank you for your service for all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| And you're a different party in the county, but you have contributed countywide very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| And we still need you because that stormwater is still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| We need your advice and consultings and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| So if you can provide that to us, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Pleasure. My relationship with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Mr. Hammond, I respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| This is not about the budget, but real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Plastic or concrete, what do you favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I don't care to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Or you can call me privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| No, I'll address it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I'm very bold in my approval of PVC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| And it's not about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| People say that PVC is not a durable product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| I don't differ with those people that say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| I used to say the very same thing because I'm retired from KUB, as many of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| And we use ductile iron in our water distribution system at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| And, boy, I thought that was the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| And it is a wonderful product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| When I retired from KUB, I went to Hullsdale Pal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I was recruited by Hullsdale Pal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| I went out there, and the former manager was using a product called Ultra Blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| And I thought, my gosh, I'm going to have to redesign all this and start using ductile iron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| Well, the more I studied the product, the more I found that that gentleman was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Mr. Gill made the right decision back in the 50s or whenever he started using Ultra Blue PVC pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| because it is very, very durable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| People say that concrete is practically indestructible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Well, I differ from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I have a photograph that I can show you with an almost in your back door of your office, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| of a large diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I think it's about a 12-inch concrete, reinforced concrete sewer pipe that did collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:48| So don't tell me that concrete is indestructible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| If it is installed improperly, it will fail, just like PVC will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| I believe we ought to keep the door open for everyone, though, on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| not just single out and say, hey, somebody's got a lock on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, Marvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:28| Well, I can't talk about whether it should be plastic or concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| but I believe old wooden bats as opposed to the aluminum bats that they're using in the World Series these days, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| That's my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Anyway, thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| This is kind of a follow-up to a meeting that we had really several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| particularly designed and crafted for the new commissioners to try and give them a feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| of what the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation attempts to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| and also an orientation in terms of trying to show you our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| and how, in fact, we are accountable to you as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| and hopefully you have been receiving the reports on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| that shows you the number of sales that we're making and how we're spending our money, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| So today I wanted to come and to thank you for your continued support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| and you will see over, if you look at the past three years, an increase to our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| and I certainly appreciate the acknowledgement of our accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| However, I will remind you, as we're going back to the orientation that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| that that is tied directly to the collection of hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Unlike the community grant organizations, you have a very, very difficult obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| and responsibility to look at each one of them because you have a certain set amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| of money. Our money given to us is based on what's collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and it's really through a contractual arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| I think a comment or a question was asked several weeks ago, and I was not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| and I apologize. I think someone had asked what percent of the hotel-motel tax collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| does the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation get, and the answer to that is 45 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| And I think it might have been stated at that time 95 percent. It's actually 45 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| Where the 95 might have come from is that if you look at that collection of hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| and Commissioner Leuthold is very familiar with this because we've gone through this year and year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| for many, many years in his previous term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| There's a certain amount that's targeted for capital projects, a certain amount targeted for operational funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| and a certain amount goes to the city, and then there's a 10 percent fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| that can be used to give to various organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| I will tell you when it was the Convention and Visitors Bureau that had the contract with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| they received 40 percent of the 40 percent that was allocated to one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| The Knoxville Sports Corporation at that time received about 8 percent of the 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| which left about 2 percent for you to do special one-time things on a different group each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| With the combining of the two organizations, we now have reduced that from 48 percent, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| to 45 percent that is allocated to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So while you see the increase in our funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| I wanted you to also see the matching increase in the revenue of the amount collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| So it's really not a constant, just an increase to us because you'd like to give that to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| but you have a very difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Just as we went through our orientation on how all the different organizations work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| and I know you've had many, many months of learning, this being your first budget for many of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I applaud you and thank you for the time and effort that you've taken to put into this to figure out how to make some of these tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| I would ask that you rely on those that have been through the process before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| rely on those that can give advice and counsel and answers to some of your questions that are very, very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| listen to those answers, and then on your own, look at it and see if it's not a good way to move forward this first year going through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:18| I think that this is a good budget, and like in anything, both in our personal lives and our career as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| we don't always have all the money we want to do what we'd like to do, so it's a matter of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| And I'd like to think that a lot of the things that are earmarked in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| prioritize the things that have been stated that are a priority of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| and trying to do so without an increase in taxes, which I know is something that y'all would be your last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| I understand, Mr. Hammond, and sometimes that may be having served on the KUB board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| I know exactly what he's talking about is that it eventually catches up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| But I wanted to just take an opportunity to thank you for everything that you've done to support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| and to please know we will continue to try and increase the revenue for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| From the time we were formed until today, we've increased those tax collections about $1 million in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| so we're working really, really hard, and we will try to continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Anything, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Yeah, Gloria, I'd just like to thank you for the job you do, but, you know, we can't break the sunshine off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| so I can't talk to these boys beside of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| All right. Council out in public, I guess. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| I just had to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Mr. Arms, before we get too far down the road, Commissioner, I mean, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| Marvin Hammond had alluded that stormwater could eventually cost us $500 million over a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| Do we have $50 million in this budget to start addressing concerns if we pass it next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I know these are just magnitudes of general magnitudes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| KUB's 10-year fix is about $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| I think the advisory committee that we have in place and Mr. Hammond's on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| they're still wrestling with numbers, and they'll be ratcheted numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I think the biggest number thrown out in that committee is like $65 million over a five-year effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| and we're going to look at creative ways to help bring in new revenue streams to help fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| What are the creative ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Creative ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| I'm sure you've started studying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| I mean, what are some of those ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Well, I guess since we have citizens on that committee, I'd just as soon wait and let them bring forth their suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| before we get ahead of an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Well, the question, I guess, is we're going to maybe be looking at it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| Is that not next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| We're looking at the ordinance next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Grant's working closer to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| When do you think we'd be voting on approving something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| The ordinances will be on the agenda in July, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| The Stormwater Advisory Committee still has another meeting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| We just had one this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| And the advisory committee hasn't made any – there hasn't been any number that's been in the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Right now, the advisory committee is determining what level of service the stormwater program would provide to citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| I think the number that Mike mentioned, 65 million over five years, was really the only number that's been thrown around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| But there hasn't been any formal recommendation to the mayor yet or to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| No recommendation by the mayor to commission yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| So you won't be voting on that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| The ordinance itself will be voted on next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| That's just a tool to which our stormwater program can use in addressing stormwater quality throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:58| So in this budget year, we won't start stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| I think that this budget year, you know, we've had a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| But Bruce Weitrich – we indicated to Bruce Weitrich to look at hiring two new stormwater inspector positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| And he'll get two new automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| So that's sort of the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| I don't know when you're going to adopt that ordinance and over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| But starting with two new inspectors and a couple of cars is our first shot out of the cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| In this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| It's in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| But when we need to make those hires, you know, it would depend on workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| But, you know, it will ratchet up over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| Okay. Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| In the same vein, and you hear things about the potential cost out there that's sort of creeping into conversations in the community, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3945)|
| 1:06:00| Would this burden fall entirely upon the government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| Would it fall upon utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Would it fall upon different commercial sectors and property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| Is there any notion of this as to where the burden would fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| I know that if it's total for the community, it's in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But the question is, how much would fall to, say, Knox County government versus various utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| versus maybe owners of different parcel business and even individual homeowners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| Is there any notion of where this would be distributed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| I know in some other, this advisory committee has looked at other practices nationwide, and it's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:49| Some falls on government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Some falls on utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Of course, the KUB fix, it fell heavily on the utility itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| But anything that falls on the back of utility will be passed on to the utility rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| I understand that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| I'll give you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| I mean, this community would have to wait for the total package of what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| And like I say, it may be picked up by different things, by your utilities, by your city government, the county government, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:20| and maybe individual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| I don't know where the burden falls on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| But this is sort of overwhelming numbers here that we need to try to get a handle on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| I know they've been working on that, and it's just a filed question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| And your question has been, that's one of the questions that committee is wrestling with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| and I know they'll bring it back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| But, you know, if you're looking at, if you're looking in Knox County, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| at part of the burden falling on utilities, we'll have to work with four or five different water districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| just like Mr. Hammond's district and First Utility District, and look at ways that they can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| And our utilities have worked, you know, one great partnership we mentioned over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| was when we had the West Nile virus, and our health department bought the West Nile virus spray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| and our utilities helped buy trucks and go spray for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| So we're looking at partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| And when I say creative, I don't think we've created them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| But you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| It's going to be, hopefully, a mix of who's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| And I don't know who will decide who's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Does the ordinance that we're going to be voting on next week or next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| sorry, Grant, the ordinance that we're going to be voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| does that not set into play what we're going to have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| It's going to have implications as far as enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Yeah, we're going to, you know, eventually there's going to be a need for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| And with enforcement comes additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| What the committee is doing right now is determining what resources are going to be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| and what level of service citizens expect from stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| And I certainly respect Mr. Hammond and his judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| It could be, you know, a half a billion dollars in the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| If that is true, then the ordinance that we're going to try to vote on next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| will set all this into play for years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| and then we have to find a revenue stream to start paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Well, as I said, the ordinance is a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| and the ordinance would handle inspections of new developments and new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| When you talk about going back and fixing old problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| subdivisions that were built years and years ago without any stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| stormwater facilities, going back and retrofitting these subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| that's where the capital, the big capital costs would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| And keep in mind, this is all EPA TDAC mandated phase two requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| We have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| This is federal, state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| So the new people we have coming on, the two new inspectors with the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| will be going out studying where we need to start spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| So it could be a year from now before we really start getting into the teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| of where the money is going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| From my understanding, the employees that are going to be hired are going to be inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| They're actually going to be on the site inspecting developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| making sure that our streams aren't being impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| These old developments that we were talking about this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| New developments. I'm sorry, new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| One thing that the Stormwater Committee, I'm a member of the Stormwater Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| I'm actually on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| One thing our committee is looking at is, well, one thing we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| via the state law, is outfall mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And moving forward with that is looking at additional resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| not just in personnel, but in technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| and determining where our priorities are, which subdivisions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| Arrowhead subdivisions, one in South Knox County, that was a million dollar fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| There's more of those out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you, Mr. Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| I think, Lee, you already asked the question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| when are we going to really start getting into the costs of the stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Is it going to be, do we need to address it in this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| or do you think we need to start addressing this in next year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| Like you said, we think we started addressing it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| With the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| It'll be bigger next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| But let me give you a comparison that's maybe a distant cousin of stormwater, and that's air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| We're in nonattainment air quality, both in ozone and PM 2.5, and Grant hit it on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| That's driven by EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| And if we don't do a good job cleaning up our air quality, EPA can make us do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| And one of the things that EPA can mandate through the state is that we have emissions testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| Other counties have emissions testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| That's an example of something, if we had emissions testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| the individual consumer who drives that car would pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and that would be part of the fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| You know, we're doing things through our air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| You know, we virtually ban open burning of brush, for instance, and that's a passive fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| But that's something we may talk about later when we're talking about, if we close down Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| where are people going to put their brush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| We don't want them burning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| So many of these issues are interrelated that it's difficult to walk up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| this is going to be a $62 million fix starting next year or $68 million over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| We'll take this one year at a time after the ordinance is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| Well, it just concerns me that we're pulling $8.3 million more out of our fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| than we did the previous year, and we've got this looming, like Mr. Hammond said, millstone around our neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4377)|
| 1:13:08| And I'm just wondering how much of a hit, if all we're talking about is a couple inspectors, this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| how much are we talking about next year and then the years after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| I mean, how soon do we think these expenses are going to hit us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| You know, a year from now, two years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Do we have a clue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| What the committee is going to do is it's going to make its recommendation within the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| That recommendation will be made to the mayor, and then commission will get those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| And that will include all the figures, you know, what level of service Knox Countians want with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:55| But let me quickly clarify, the ordinance that's going to be on the agenda in July is not directly related to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:06| This ordinance needs to get passed as soon as possible, the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| That's just a tool that we're going to use to regulate stormwater in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| The process itself, as I said, should be done in the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| And we're going to make our recommendation to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And then moving forward, you'll get a recommendation well before fiscal year 08-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| No pun intended, but it seems like we're dipping into our rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| We got the stormwater getting ready to hit us big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| And I'm just concerned that as when years to come, that we could have maybe a substantial tax increase to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:51| And we won't have our rainy day fund available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Well, as Mike mentioned, you know, we're looking at other alternatives to a property tax to pay for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| Right now, I think it's paid for from the gasoline tax, engineering public works budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| It's paid for by the gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Our gas tax pays for our stormwater right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| So that's one thing the committee is looking at is where we can get revenue, you know, what other opportunities for revenue there are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:18| There's other communities that we've looked at that Mike has mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| There's stormwater utilities that charge a user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Are we looking at possible impact fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| It's been discussed in the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| But once again, we haven't made any concrete recommendations yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| No pun intended with the concrete, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Yeah, no pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Grant, when this order is passed, when does it go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| Is it within 30 days, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| So after 30 days, if we're not following the ordinance, can we be held in contempt, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| Can somebody come after us if we've got an ordinance in effect and not following that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| I don't believe we're going to pass it and not intend to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| From what I understand, we are hiring a couple of inspectors who will ensure that our enforcement mechanism is administered properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:19| And once again, this is our state mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| We're a phase two community, and we have a permit, basically a permit with the state, state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| So to meet that, those permit obligations, we have to pass this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| Now you mentioned to me earlier about going back and fixing things that have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| Now, the city, I work for city engineering, and we're not going back and fixing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| Now, we compile problems that people call in, complaints, and then we try to deal with them based on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| But we've got a lot of situations in the city that we're not repairing, so we're not having to go back and spend $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Well, and like I said, the $500 million, it hasn't, that number itself hasn't been in the committee discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| Certainly, you can, you could spend it, but the only number that we've, that I'm aware of is $65 million, I think, over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:09| That's the only number that's been thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| How are you coming up with the $65 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Our consultants came up with it looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| At the problems we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Looking at some scenarios, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| At the problems we have already in the county that have to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| Well, no, that's including, no, that's not just capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| That's employees, that's technology, and that's over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| And it's phased in, and once again, this recommendation, those numbers have not been formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| So the $500 million could be exaggerated a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| No, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| I honestly don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| I work with city engineering, and I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| $500 million is the number, I think, it was what KUB had spent over 10 years, the PACE 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| The PACE, they pay their own through their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Yeah, and also, utility districts and utilities do not, are not responsible for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| That's simply wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| They're not charged with, it's Knox County's name on the permit, the TDEC permit and EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| I just want to say, come up with a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| When does this hammer fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| When do we have to be in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| Or when do we have to have an ordinance passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Has the EPA give us a date yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| TDEC, we have a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I don't know what it is off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Chris, we can find out, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| It's within, it's long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| All I know is TDEC asks us about every time they make a call on Bruce, when are you going to pass your ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| I mean, that's a question we've heard over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Normally the way it is around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| I don't know if anyone has a gun to their head, but we do have to pass an ordinance sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| That's what it usually is around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| We have to have a gun to our head before we do anything, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| And one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| I wanted to, you know, the terms impact fees and utility fees and higher taxes or user fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| when the time comes, the commission will be, I mean, this won't be an executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| This will be one where we'll have a series of workshops and work with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| and you'll hear different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| And it's something that we've got to work through together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| There's no one single answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| But I think you do understand there's a problem that has to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| and it will be addressed incrementally over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| And the commission will be an integral part of determining how we're going to do the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Ernest Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4785)|
| 1:20:01| Ladies and gentlemen of the Knox County Commission, my name is Ernest Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| I live at 1220 Eagle Nest Lane here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| The good news is I'm not going to request anywhere near what I've heard so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| I'm a member of the Greater Knoxville Tennis Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| and also a former board member of that association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| And for three years we have been working with both the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| and Knox County Parks and Recreation Departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| to try to obtain funding for renovation of a facility here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| known as the West Hills Tennis Center or also the Jack Murphy Tennis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| For those of you who may not be familiar, it is located adjacent to the Westside Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| next to the West Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| It is only one of two multi-court facilities in all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| the other one being Tyson down by the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| The facility is a general public facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| It is used by everyone in Knox County, but it is also used by the Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| for high school and middle school tennis, competitive tennis that they play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| as a part of their overall athletic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| For over five years, this facility has been there, best I can tell, for about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| And during that 30 years, there has been patchwork maintenance done on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| but nothing done to it that will allow it to remain in a good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| And for over five years, it has now deteriorated to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| where USTA, which is the United States Tennis Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| has told the Greater Knoxville Tennis Association that we can no longer use those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| for either league or tournament play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| For the last several years, we have solicited tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| both statewide and southern section wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| on behalf of the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| But we are no longer able to solicit those tournaments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| because we do not have enough tennis facilities in the city to bid on the tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| which require a minimum of at least 28 courts and restroom facilities at all of the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| Tyson is the only facility here in all of Knox County that is available for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| and it only has 14 courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| The facilities at West Hills have no bathroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| They have no drinking water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| If someone were here from the Y, I think they would lend their support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| because of the number of people that play on those courts that go up to the Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| and ask if they can use their restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| The city of Knoxville has finally put in their budget of capital expenditure, $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| to start a program for the renovation of West Hills Tennis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| In addition, in doing that, the city was able to obtain a state grant of another $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| The Greater Knoxville Tennis Association, through donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| has been able to raise another $40,000 to provide us so far with $240,000 to start the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:15| We're estimating that over a three-year period, it would take approximately $1.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| to bring that facility up to the point where it could be used for USTA tournaments that are sanctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| To give you some idea of the impact, I think the Greater Knoxville Sports and Tennis Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| estimates about $180 per person per day that a visitor spends in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| The larger tournaments, which are presently going to towns like Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| and the big southern section tournaments that go to places like Cary, North Carolina, Little Pelham, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| those draw over 1,000 players, not counting the supporting people that come with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| And if it's a junior, what they call bullfrog tournament, that has anywhere from 800 to 1,000 players,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| of course their mothers and fathers are here with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| So you can see the impact that one tournament could bring over a four- or five-day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| that we simply can't bid on anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| What I'm asking is, and I've just looked at the five-year capital expenditure carried forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| there is nothing budgeted for the West Hills Tennis Center of any type of capital appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| And on behalf of the 1,700 members of the Greater Tennis Association of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| we're simply requesting that the county consider a minimum of at least $200,000 over the next three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| to allow us, the Greater Knoxville Tennis Association, in support with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| to go out and try to obtain additional grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| There are grants that will help supplement the cost of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| but in those that we've contacted, the first question that is always asked is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| is both the city and the county committed to seeing this project carried forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| And of course, so far, we have not been able to give an affirmative to that to allow us to seek those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| So I'm simply on behalf of 1,700 members of GKTA saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| please give consideration to a budget of capital expenditure to a couple hundred thousand over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| That will allow us to carry that project forward and complete it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| to where it will adequately represent the city and the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| I also have a packet of information that I'd like to leave for each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| along with a set of photographs showing you the current condition of West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| and also some architectural renders of what we hope we'll be able to accomplish over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| Okay, I think we've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Do you work any with Gloria Ray's group, the Knoxville Sports Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| I mean, is that something that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Is that the Knoxville Sports and Tourism Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Gloria, do you ever do any work with this tennis group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| Is it possible for them to somehow fall underneath your umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| or get some help through you all or get some hotel-motel money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| I'm sorry, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| Our core mission, obviously, is to go after events that we can bring to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| and he's very correct in saying that there are some events that we would like to go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| that we don't have the inventory of venues that we need, so we have to change what we would go after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| As an example would be, we may have a multi-sport event coming to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| where tennis plays a small fraction to where we can get by with just the courts at Tyson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| The type of events that he's talking about would require more than one multi-court facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| Similar to soccer, we are very limited to what soccer events we can go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| because of the soccer field arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| In other words, there's two here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| but you can go to some small cities that might have 20 soccer fields in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| Knox County has not, and the city of Knoxville, have not developed in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| They've been more neighborhood where it meets the needs of those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| and it's not been a priority for it to come in and build one facility that would meet a countywide need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:33| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Well, I guess my question, to get back, is there any way to use hotel-motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| money to fund this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| If you go back to the hotel-motel fund, if we can look at it as a dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| in other words 100%, 10% of it immediately goes, or 40% immediately goes to a capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| it must be spent on capital indebtedness, bond debt, for tourist-related facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:04| Would this fall underneath that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| That would certainly be up to county commission, and I don't know what the criteria to that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| I think you're going to have to look at the number of hotel room blocks that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| You're going to have to look at how do they advertise and how they market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| You can go through some of the things that they've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| and it's been pretty wide-ranging in terms of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| So that 40% of the hotel-motel tax is to be used for capital projects for tourist-related facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| whereas the other 40% is for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| So it's possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I would think that there's probably an application process to go through to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| Now, we're hosting the Junior Olympics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Is the tennis part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| There's no tennis within the Junior Olympics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| There's 22 sports at 29 different venues, and I will tell you some of the venues we've had to go outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| but most of them are in Knox County. The majority of them are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| But tennis is not included in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Not in this Junior Olympics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| It was in 1993. It was not in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| AAU chooses the sports that is included in the Olympic Games for that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| similar to the Olympic Games overall in past years, now that we're talking about women's softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| In past years, women's softball has been a part of the Olympics, but going forward it will not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| So the governing organization chooses what sports are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| But there's a lot of USTA events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| There's a lot of your level four, four, five, and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| and those particular things that are huge attractions for folks to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| and we just simply cannot go after some of those because we do not have the venues to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| Similar to the fact that I really don't want to get into this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| but there are certain events or certain conventions we don't go after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| because of the hotel room inventory that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| We have to look at who's willing to go to multiple hotels and be bussed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| If a tennis event is willing to go to multiple facilities and us have to bus them around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| then we can attract them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| But more and more of them now, the higher caliber, want the 20 or 30 courts in one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| as they do in soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Commissioner Ivan-Halleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| I just want to know, Cynthia, is this something that you all could help them in on the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| Is there grant monies for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| We will have to do some research, but I'm pretty sure that there is probably something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| that we can help this organization with because when they present us an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| then we'll get our staff to start researching to see if there's monies that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| either at the federal level, either private foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Maybe they might even have some leads, and we can use our expertise and technical assistance to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| Okay. I'd be willing to commit 500 of my grant money if we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| If the budget passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| So he might want to check with other commissioners, but I'd like to help him some if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| There are USTA grants available also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| They range in the neighborhood of from $35,000 to $50,000, which is, you know, worth going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:05| The problem is when we try to contact USTA to find out about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| they asked for a letter both from Knox County and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| that this project both will be funded and will be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| and we simply have no way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| At this point, we're unable to go after those specific grants as well as a number of other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| where grants are available, like the US National Parks and Recreation Department has grants available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| But we're unable to go after those because we've never been able to get a capital expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| placed within the budget that shows a commitment on behalf of both Knox County and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| to carry the project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Get with Ms. Fancher, and she's going to work with you on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| You mentioned these school groups and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Do the school groups pay you any money for using the facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| No, that's a public facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I assume I'm not familiar how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| I do know the Knox County school system uses those courts because I've been there to watch the high school players play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| I mean, do they hold tournaments there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| I mean, is that where Bearden holds tournaments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Well, like Bearden will play Farragut or West will play, you know, Marival or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| and they use those facilities because it's the only multi-court facility other than Tyson that's available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| And, of course, without any public restrooms, it does get a little embarrassing at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Do they block up a lot of your time when they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| I assume they block it with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| I'm not sure how it works for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| They have certain afternoons that they are scheduled to play there, and they occupy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| I think it's nine out of the 12 courts that they use when they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| That's only during the school season, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| But there are a lot of other programs that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| We have, through the Greater Knoxville Tennis Association, we have a Never-Evers program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| which is tennis for beginning senior players, and they practice there and play there as well as does the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| If you can just leave it, start, just hand it right there on that end, and he'll pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| There's a packet for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Buddy Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| There's only one packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| This is for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| I think he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| I don't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Okay. He must be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| Gina Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| My name is Gina Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I'm here as a private citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I've resided on Duncan Road in West Knox County for 40-some-odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| I'm also here as president of Friends of the Library, and it's in this latter capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| that I'm especially concerned, and I simply want to raise this to a little higher level of consciousness to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| The library budget is lean and mean, and I applaud the library staff, whom I've observed closely for the last couple or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:24| do an efficient, wonderful job with the money that they have, but I'm especially concerned about the materials budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:34| which is less this year than it was even four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| I'm an educator by profession, and I've had a lot of experience with libraries in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:47| and I know what happens when a library falls behind in acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| I've heard it said that for a library to fall behind one year is really, it amounts to 10 years in playing catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5692)|
| 1:35:04| I know that there are people in Knox County and maybe sitting in this room who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| well, with the Internet, why do we need materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| The Internet is wonderful, but it is no substitute for print material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| and there is no substitute for those research librarians at our central library, Lawson McGee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| who are able to answer questions from print material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| If any of you have gone to Wikipedia to access some information and know something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| you've probably discovered that there are a lot of errors out there because there's no quality control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| So we simply, as a community, must have a materials budget that at least stays even with what it was four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:53| I am going to be the second one this evening to say the words tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| None of us wants to hear that, but if county commission and county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:08| determine that all of the libraries or the county's departments are run efficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:17| that we are getting the most that we can out of our taxpayer dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| then I think we simply must bite the bullet, and I know that is going to fall to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| I echo what Mr. Hammond said earlier about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| But please know that there is a lot of support, especially if programs that Knox County has come to value so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:40| our schools, our parks, our libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| This has been a lesson in civics this evening, just to listen to all of the demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| on our taxpayer dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| We deserve a quality of life that is good and decent, and that certainly includes our public libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| I was at the public hearing a couple of weeks ago that turned out not to get around to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:11| I had to leave before there was an opportunity to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| But there was a lot of talk among several commissioners about money for our sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| Because I live in the county, I depend upon the security that is provided by that sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| But as I look at comparable communities in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| if we're able to fund our sheriff's department at Rolls Royce prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| let's please keep the library at least horse and buggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| There might be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Yeah, I just wanted to say to you, first of all, I don't think that we're funding our sheriff's department at Rolls Royce prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| I think we're funding our sheriff's department at old used Ford prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| And I do, I am concerned about the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| And I would like to see us get more materials into the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| But you mentioned a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| And if you want to increase your taxes, you're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| And in fact, if you make donations to the library, and if you buy materials for the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| you're essentially increasing your own taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And if you want to increase your taxes, I welcome you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| You'll get some tax relief on the federal level for donations that you make to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| And, you know, don't make us, you know, if we don't raise your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| you're still welcome to give the library system more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| And I would applaud you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| And as a retired school teacher on somewhat of a fixed income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| I do give as much as I can, not just to the library, but to other public organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| But I think it's a bigger problem, not just for libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| but for stormwater, for parks, for tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| And it just may be that a tax increase is the only way that we're going to continue at the high level that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:22| Ma'am, if a lot of folks who are asking us for a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| and I think that when my constituents elected me being a low tax activist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| that they sent a very clear message that they didn't want a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| But if everyone who comes up asking us to increase their taxes would just voluntarily give more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| you know, we may not need to raise taxes so often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| And there are struggling families out there that are really, really struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| And with gasoline at $3 a gallon, I'm going to work really hard to see that we don't have to raise their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:56| I want to work hard to see that we do as much as we can with what money we have at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| But like I said, I don't want to raise the people's taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| And this is a tough time for families with gasoline and everything going up so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| But for the folks that want a tax increase, you know, I just want to make it real clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| you know, we will gladly, county government will gladly take your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| And we'll not only take your money, but we'll let you choose where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| If you want the money to go into the library system instead of the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| when you make that as a private donation, you get to choose where it goes as opposed to us choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| So, you know, I would much rather see donations as higher taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| Okay. Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Ms. Bashman, I just want to echo a little bit of what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| The sheriff's office is run very efficiently and not at Rolls Royce, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| But we do have a great library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| They do a fabulous job with what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| They really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| They work hard and we've got a great director, nationally recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| And thank you for what you do for the library system, for working with them and volunteering your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| Knox County certainly appreciates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| But I will tell you that we are having a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| I mean, we're taking almost $9 million out of debt service, $5 million out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| So, in a roundabout way, we are having a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| And I would like to see some more money spent inside that library, on the front lines of the library, where it needs to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| We've done a good job, I think, in the past years building libraries, you know, in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| But up at Lawson McGee, you know, they're stretched right there, you know, for room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| Thank you again for what you do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| Thank you for those remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| I don't in any way want to pit the library against the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| That's not my intention at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| But I do think that the library, at less than 2% of the county budget, that we need to be very careful to preserve this community treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:15| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| Commissioner Leuco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| Yes, Ms. Bashburn, I want to thank you for your service that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| And you're very correct in terms of the materials things for the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| You pointed me to that advisory committee for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| But when you're buying less than half the material you were buying four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| the cost would probably go up just to get the same material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| But when you're spending half the amount of money on materials, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| in another four years we will be spending zero dollars on materials, and we won't have a library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| We'll have a museum, because all we're going to have is old materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| And so that does need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| And we do have a good library system, and we've done a very fine job with the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| But when we get to, that's the part that cannot be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| Because once you stop ordering materials and you've got a series of them, you can't go back and pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| It's lost forever, a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| And that is a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| And I think we need to be aware of that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Mr. Chairman, I would just add Friends of the Library is an excellent group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| And I recently gave $300 out of my discretionary account to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| If other people who speak about private giving or discretionary account giving want to join me in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| I welcome them, because Friends of the Library does a great group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| And anything they can do to supplement the rather meager acquisitions budget or any other library needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| would be a welcome thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| And the North Knox branch appreciates that $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| I think they're hard at work deciding how they're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Do we have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| I'd like to make one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| We've heard from several commissioners about the importance of getting more money in this library materials budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| And we're increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| We've done some scratching and moving line items around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| And we're going to add $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| Ironically, we had a recent off-site retreat and talked about some of these varied things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| and talked about creative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| For instance, when Harry Potter comes out this summer and every kid wants that book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| maybe trying to find corporate sponsors for books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| I mean, would you buy 500 copies of Harry Potter to put it in our library this summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| So we realize that everyone tighten their belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| This is one we heard from commissioners on and staff and especially Senior Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6293)|
| 1:45:01| And we've added $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| And we're going to look for other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| We know we've got a great library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| We know we need to help it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| I want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Commissioner Smith mentioned something a second ago about this being the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| The $3 million in the grant budget, that community grant budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| we have so many great nonprofit organizations in this community are doing so many great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| I mean, from the Seymour Fire Department to Friends of the Library and everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| It was tough to try to hold the line on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| But we don't want to indicate that there's not some flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| And Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Lampert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| what has happened historically is the commission has come back with some reasonable amendments to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:50| Commissioner Luthold has handled that many a time when I was on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| And if it's reasonable, we're going to try to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| We're not trying to be inflexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| But what we didn't want to do is just sit here and take these one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| you know, as citizens roll up here and try to say, can we give them 10 or can we give them 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| So it was tough to hold the line on that $3 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| And you're the appropriators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| And we're going to heed your amendments and try to make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| I think that addition of the $150,000 material to the library is an example of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Betty Crawford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| My name is Betty Crawford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| I'm with the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| This is not my normal role to be up here giving the speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| I'm usually the one sitting back there helping the president give the speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| But the leadership is out of town, so I've been asked to address you all tonight about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| Several months ago, several of you all sat in front of us before the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| and talked about education and how important it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| And this is an exciting time for you all in that now you get to fund education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| because you all talked about how important it was and how important it was to fund education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| We are requesting that you support the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| It's a good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| We could always use more money, but it's a far cry from where we've been in the past, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| The other thing in education I want to address tonight is the partnership budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I know that has become a very controversial topic for several other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| and there are several questions about how the partnership money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| I know that Mrs. Buttrey last night asked Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| you know, what's the commission going to do about the partnership budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| And of course he said it's up to the school board to make that decision as to how the money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| It's your decision as to how much money goes to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| I've been in education for 34 years, 17 of it being in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| And I'll have to say that I was drug kicking and screaming into this partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| to learn something new and to kind of think outside my comfort zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| All of the initiatives that the partnership has undertaken we've been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| and they're all excellent, excellent programs, excellent initiatives that gets kids started on the right path to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| and help for middle school kids and high school kids alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| The one that I am the most familiar with is the TAP program, Teacher Advancement Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| It has probably been one of the hardest things I've ever been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| but also one of the most gratifying things I have ever been involved with as far as education is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| The commissioners that have Pond Gap, Holston Middle, and Northwest Mill in their district should be very proud of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| They have done a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| I cannot begin to tell you the time that has been spent on this program educating students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| We have not talked about it much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| This is our first year because, frankly, we didn't have a whole lot to talk about in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| People were unhappy, people were frustrated, and we were trying to find our way also with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| But we've come out of the other end of it, and we're all walking and talking and surviving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| which is a good thing for us in those three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| And I just think that you need to understand how important this is for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| This initiative is the only one like it in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| We have been visited and microscoped and applauded from all across the country for what we're doing in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| along with all the other partnership initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| So I want you to stop and think about that when you cast your final vote for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| and please send the partnership budget in its totality to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| We have worked with the board, talked with board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| and I really believe that some of the issues that board members have with the partnership budget can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| It's just important that you support what's going on in the school system because it is a wonderful system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| This is a wonderful partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| As I said, a lot of things that have been done are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| But I want to take just a moment for you to – I have an entourage tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| I don't travel alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| It's not safe to travel by yourself to come to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| So I brought an entourage with me tonight, and I want to take just a couple of minutes of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| to let you hear from the master mentor teachers at some of these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and one of the principals at Holston Middle, just so you get a flavor of what this has done for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| Hey, Betty, let me stop you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| You know, I don't think there's anyone on this commission that doesn't support the Great School Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| doesn't support the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| If we want to do anything, I think we give the schools more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| And we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| I think, you know, I think the question was that somebody might get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| we're not going to fund the Great School Partnership in its current form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| That's what we'd heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Well, whoever told you that is not telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| You're on record tonight in front of God and everybody, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| God and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| But the school system did come to us and had like $17.5 million of needs that's not currently funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:07| Now, they said they can trim some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| But, you know, like their literacy program, $3.23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| And I think they really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| And I think they really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| And I think it was just us speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| If we send the $6.5 million in the Great School Partnership to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| that it stay in its entirety there, not when it gets over, we're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| use this $6.5 million to do the literacy program, buy some textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| And that's what we would hope, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Because the literacy initiative is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| I mean, it's kids have to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| But you can establish that through many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| And to start that initiative would take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| It won't all happen in one year because you have to do the planning and the testing and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| But what the partnership is doing right now for schools has been truly amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| I wish that each of you could spend some time in a TAP school or visit the pre-K program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| Because I think you'll find, you'll walk away realizing that the money is well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| TAP is an expensive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| But education is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| And we made a commitment in the association when we signed on to work with TAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| that it was going to be done the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And that meant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| And that meant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| And it's just important that you all get the picture of what this system has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:38| and what we're on the verge of being able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| It is just, I am impressed every time I go into one of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| It just amazes me what these people have been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| And we appreciate what the Great School Partnership does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| And I know there's many, many people in the different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| that really have worked hard on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| So we want to make sure it stays intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| And I think that was maybe the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| And if people got the wrong idea, then I guess I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| But I don't think it was anyone on this commission's idea to cut the Great School Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| Now, I'm going to hold you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| I said I'm going to hold you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| You can hold us to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| But I would like, because these people did come out of, some of them are on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| some of them haven't, and I know that you all are tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| But I really would like for you just to hear just a couple of comments from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| so that you get a flavor of what the partnership has done and what TAP schools are all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| Let's see if somebody has a question for you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| It's not really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| Just to echo what you said, the Great School Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| since I've been on this commission learning more and more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| you know, when you're trying to get parents involved in their children's education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| every school I've been to in my district talking to principals and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| if you ask them one thing, you know, what can I do for you, how can I help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| that inevitably is at the top of their list, get more parents involved in their children's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| That helps us more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| And that's what the Great School Partnership does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| And I think it's wonderful what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| Commissioner Boas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| I just want to state that the literacy program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| and I know from talking to Mr. Brown a number of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| I know Mr. Brown is here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| what the TAP program has done at Holston Middle School has raised the bar to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| And we're glad you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Well, you have made us feel so much better, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| where I can sleep tonight knowing that you're going to send that money over to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| I'm Tom Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| I'm the principal of Holston Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| And thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| I didn't know that Betty was going to pull me up here like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| But I'll stay in the heat tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Commissioner Boas has investigated TAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| He's been over and seen what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| And I'm very glad that he's taken that interest in our program over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| I think they looked at it for the school that he works in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| And I think that's a testimony to the benefits of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| I can stand here and talk for hours, and you don't want me to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| and I don't want to do that either, about the goodness of TAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| and what it brings to schools like mine in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| I want to tell you a few things about my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| We're a hard-to-staff school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| We have incredible teacher turnover every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| We're not facing that kind of turnover this year with the TAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| This is a program that nurtures teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| It keeps teachers in the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| It pays teachers more than they make in other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| It puts us on a level playing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| as far as attracting teachers from suburban schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| We have master teachers in our building who work in suburban schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| that we were not able to attract into our hard-to-staff school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| to work with our students before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| Their job may have been a little easier in the school that they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| So they certainly had more resources to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| But what TAP has given us is a level playing field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| an opportunity for us to have an effective teacher in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| Now, we're bringing data together right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| that will prove everything that we can stand up here and testify to tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| that our students will have improved test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| They will have outstanding value-added scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| And that will be because of one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| and that's because every teacher in our building has raised the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| of their effectiveness this school year because of the TAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| Every teacher in our building will have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| to earn a pay bonus, an incentive pay plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| And whoever thought KCA would be supporting an incentive pay plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| But they do. And it's a wonderful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| We are seeing just the early returns of being involved with a program like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:06| And yes, it's an expensive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| It's not for every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Obviously, if we put this program in some schools in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| then that really tilts the playing field so that we're no longer equitable in what we go after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| But I know one thing, and I think I'm the senior secondary administrator in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| as far as a school-based administrator, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| And I can tell you that this is the best program I've ever been a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| in terms of staff development for teachers, in terms of raising the bar for student performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| in terms of looking at teacher accountability, principal accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| And I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| And our teachers have accepted that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| They've risen to that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| And the level of performance that we're seeing among our young teachers is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| We had a teacher just about a month ago who won the Walmart Teacher of the Year program in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:05| And when the Walmart folks called me to make inquiries about this teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| I thought they were talking about another teacher in our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| who had just won the Knox County Teacher of the Year award for middle school teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| And as we talked a little more, I found out that that's not the teacher they were talking about at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| They were talking about a first-year teacher who had so impressed them with her ability in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| that they elected her as the Walmart Teacher of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| That's something to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| A first-year teacher who is performing at the same level as an excellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| a very excellent five or six or seven-year teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And that's what this program does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| My name is Keith Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| I'm the mentoring science teacher at Holston Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| So I second a lot of what Mr. Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| The two teachers he spoke of that won the awards are both science teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| And I've had the opportunity to work with them this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| The one that he mentioned, the first-year teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| my chances to work with her, be in her classroom throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| and the amount of growth that I could see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| and it's not been that long ago since I had my first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| but the amount of growth I could see in her and in her teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| and her awareness of the things that were impacting students in her classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| and how that changed from the beginning of the year to the end of the year was phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| The other first-year teacher that comes to mind in our building is his second career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| He's coming back and going into the teaching profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| and actually doing that on account of a grandfathered license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| where he really hadn't had the teaching training yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| And this program was one of those two that allowed him to develop those skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| and have the kind of support that he needed as he progressed through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, you know, again, I've not been around that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| but in my six years and the things I've had a chance to be a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| this has been one of the most beneficial programs for developing the talents of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| and for really looking at individual students and the needs that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| when it comes to academics and really trying to take a proactive step to meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| Hello. My name is Christy Sharp. I'm a mentor teacher at Northwest Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| And I have to sort of echo what he said about first-year teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| Had this program been in place when I started my teaching career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| I think it would have made a huge difference by leaps and bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| in what I had been able to do in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| When I was asked to become a mentor, I, of course, saw money more than anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| and jumped right in with both feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| But it has really been a learning experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| It has improved my ability in the classroom as well as my ability to work with other teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| and help them improve their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| We have seen significant gains in student achievement this year in our writing scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| We were 65% proficient last year, and our goal for this year was 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| We have 82% proficiency this year on our 8th grade writing scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:07| Of course, TCAP data is not back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| So we won't have that information for about another month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| But we are very confident that we're going to see gains as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| We would like to imagine they would be 17%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| But, of course, anything is better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| But we certainly need to keep TAP in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| until we have data to prove or disprove its ability to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| And I have my partner in crime here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| I'm Jamie Esco, also a Northwest Master Teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| And as Christy was saying about our gains in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| all of that is a direct impact from TAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| As we were working on strategies for main idea and supporting details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| the students took that and were able to become independent with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| and use it on their own writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| And that's why we've made such increase on our writing assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| My name is Margo Del Monte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| and I'm one of the ones that came from suburbia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| into Holston Middle School from West Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| I guess I never realized how uneven the playing field was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| until I moved from West Knoxville into Holston Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| Everybody's been talking about new teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| This is my 33rd year of teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| and I've learned more this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| than I have in the previous 33 years in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Why? Because this is an ongoing professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| that occurs weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| Then the support is given daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| There's nothing before this, like this, ever been done in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| and I hope that you will come and visit us and continue this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| My name is Karen Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| I'm a master teacher at Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| And what you've just heard from all of these teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| I can only echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| We have reading scores on benchmark tests for our 5th graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| We have improved our advanced proficient students by 22%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| on our benchmarks since the beginning of the year, from August to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| This TAP program has allowed us to teach children to think deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| and to process more efficiently and more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| I, too, have learned more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| I've been in the teaching profession for 20-something years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| and I have learned more about how children think and how they learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| And I have also learned right along with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| It is a terrific program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| Thank you for listening to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| My name is Dina Grogan, and I'm a master teacher at Pond Gap Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| And I want to talk about the students for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| The students are all speaking the same language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| and they are thinking and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| and they know the purpose for learning now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| and they're really, really excited about learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| And that learning is based on field testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| that the master and the mentor teachers are doing in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| We're not reading books and looking at strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| that we're using in California or Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| We are using researched best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| and we're field testing those theories in classrooms at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| And then we deliver those strategies to teachers weekly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| in very focused professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| So for the teachers at Pond Gap and the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| I just wanted to say that they're just doing a wonderful, wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| And everybody is excited about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| Hi, my name is Sandra Kaduma, and I am the mentor teacher at Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| One of the things I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| yes, we have all become much better teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| I myself am so much better than I was at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| The thing that I've noticed that really has made TAP come home for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| is that I don't just produce children that learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| I produce now children that think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| My students, when they leave, their critical thinking skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| is so much better than it has been in the years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| TAPS has given us the tools to help our children learn to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| And we have a limited amount of time that we can teach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| but children will always learn if they can think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| And we have children going out now into middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| that are real thinkers and processors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| and they are going to do tremendous things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| So it will be really interesting to watch these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| Cheryl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| Very briefly, I'm Cheryl Kershaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| director of the Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| for such tremendous hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| It has been a very difficult year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| They have transformed a vision into reality, and it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| And it's the feeling that the partnership is trying to create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| that we can do things differently than we've done them in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| And it has been a risk-taking experience for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| So please join me in thanking all these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Everyone that signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| does anybody else in the audience wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| I guess John Troyer, if you want to come on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| you're going to be the point man for the administration maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:29| Aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Does anybody have any questions for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| about the budget to the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Mr. Chairman, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| Mr. Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Mr. Troyer, I had asked yesterday about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| we've got a $57 million bond that will float for the deputy's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| a $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| First of all, what is Knox County's debt right now today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| We passed out that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I don't have that in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| but in round numbers, 500 plus million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| 534 million, probably close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| And we've got a $57 million bond for the deputy's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| a $30 million bond that's going for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| to plan schools and to finish Powell Middle School, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| $30 million is the current year, or 2007-2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| capital improvements plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| So it's, Powell Middle is the biggest piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| but then everything else is in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| $9 million we have coming out of our debt service account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| And $5 million out of our rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Six million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| How much is left in the debt service account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| after $9 million comes out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| About $18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| About $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| The way that we've done this, and let me just describe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| little bit about how we put the capital improvements plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| It was a conscious choice to decrease the debt service fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| We wanted to protect the general fund fund balance as well as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| The way the mayor posed the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| when we put the budgets together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| and it's been this way several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| is how much can we do in the capital improvements plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| And we have, in my opinion, pushed the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| And so, and that's exactly what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| With that $18 million left, how long will it take to deplete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| The way that it's scheduled out is it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| over the course of five years, it would be depleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| with the capital improvements plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| And the rainy day fund that we're taking $6 million out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:48| how much is in that account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| We started the year with $39 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| We expect to put back $3 million in the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| So, we think we'll come out $3 million to the good in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| year's budget, okay? And then draw down six next year. So 39 plus 3 is 42 and come back to 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:12| Lee, could I interrupt you a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Is this the stuff that you handed out to us that would answer some of these questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:23| That's our information, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| Would you mind to take this and some of these? They might be page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7766)|
| 2:09:37| John, I'm looking on page 11 of that handout. It's got school construction fund, 19.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| Is that what school construction is? I mean, we've got 15 million going to PAL, 5 million for the physical plan upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:59| Yes, you're correct on that. The 15 million dollars in PAL is in the capital improvements plan and that's under the countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:08| That's the county making the, issuing the debt on the school's behalf and the county actually making the payments so the schools don't have to make the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:18| Which I think is a good thing for the county to do when it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| Help pay for school projects as well as the 5 million dollars for the PPU. Both of those items are in capital improvements plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:32| The piece that you're looking at on page 11 is the sales tax collected for the specific purpose of school construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:40| which they use all of that for their debt payments of our 534 million dollars in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| About half of that is schools and they use all of this school construction fund money to pay their debts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| and then they dip into their operating budget about 5 million dollars for their annual debt payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7852)|
| 2:11:00| Okay. If it's got the 30 million dollars you're using for capital for schools, is it in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| does it point out what projects and how much we're spending on each project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| And you're talking about the 30 million dollar bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| 30 million dollar bond, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| Yeah, it's the first year of the capital improvements plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| Okay, what page is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| It would be everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| Okay, John, this is the question. 30 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| We know Powell Middle School is 15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| We know we have the physical plan upgrades 5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| That's 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| We've got 10 million left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Does it tell us in here what projects are going and how much each project is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| I know we've got the four schools. We're doing some design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| How much for each school are we having a budget to plan and design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| Yeah, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| There was a million nine in there for the four schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| and it has not been specifically allocated to those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| but it was to help define the projects and once we get a better definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| we'd know how big a project was needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| and how much a project might be for the commission to consider at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| Okay, that's 16.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| No, that's 21.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| You just go through the pages, a couple hundred thousand dollars for libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| 700,000 dollars for parks, 1,000,066 for PBA facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:38| 779,000 for PBA energy management projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| And what page are you going through right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| That's page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| Page nine is 2.85 in road projects and a million for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:54| Page ten, we've got another 12 million dollars for schools that would be paid back by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7974)|
| 2:13:02| A million for stormwater, I thought we were just doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:09| Yeah, that's a million dollars in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| John, are you saying there's debt that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| that are going to be paid by the school so it's not going to be part of that 30 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| That would be a part of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| And so we break that out and that's something that we do with the school board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| they know what part is theirs and ours and then we try to save money by doing one bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| sharing the closing costs, and we each make our own proportional payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| So if there's a 30 million, I think it, do all these projects add up to 30 million or do they add up to more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| They add up to more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| So, in other words, we're paying, we're doing some capital projects using operational funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| Yes, there's some operational money in here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| And is it school operational money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| Okay, for instance, we know that we are using $800,000 that was money that was on deposit with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:22| We're using one-time savings of $683,000 from this year's budget and another $200,000 from Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| But what we're asking, and that's what we're asking the county commission to approve is 30 million dollars to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:41| and then there's two resolutions, actually three resolutions on bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| The initial 87 million, which is 57 plus 30, and then two specific resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| So we pass the 87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| And there will be two more resolutions to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| And so that would be just the specific for the 30 and the specific for the 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| Well, I think that might be part of the question that some of the commissioners have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| we've got operational money and some Hotel Motel funds paying for capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| So it's not like bond issue is paying for every capital project, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| But it's one-time operational money and we try to match those one-time operational monies with one-time spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| To finish my thought here, if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| We've got 36 million dollars left in the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| That's our expectation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| Is there a minimum amount required to keep that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| Knox County ordinance is five percent, and we have traditionally been well above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:48| Five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| So 57 million dollars for one bond, 30 million for another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| nine million out of debt service, six million out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| It's 103 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| And we're increasing our debt 103 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| What about our revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| Are we going to have revenues to pay for 103 million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| I mean, this is how we're going to borrow, and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| I mean, if you're taking it out of the debt service, we're borrowing that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| If you're taking it out of the rainy day fund, it's coming at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| You know, that's borrowing out of your rainy day fund, 30 million and 57 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| We're borrowing over 100 million dollars with no revenue stream to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| How do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Well, when we put this budget together, that was one of the directives that we had from the mayor was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:51| you hear things like, you know, we want to support the libraries, we want to support the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| we want to support the sheriff, we want to support the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| And my directive from the mayor was, is we want to do as much as we can at the current tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:05| And that's what we tried to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| And that's what the budget before you is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| We could do a lot more then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| I mean, why not borrow 200 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Well, I mean, do that at the current tax rate too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| At 22 cents, part of our tax rate is 22 cents for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| And what we've done is we've scheduled it out to draw down over the course of five years our debt service fund down to zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| and just make it with the 22 cents it's allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| If we borrowed more, then that would be more than what we're going to bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| I think this is very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| With this, I mean, coupled with what we've heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| and I know you're saying $65 million for the stormwater, but it could be as much as a half a million dollars in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| We're going to be doubling our debt, if that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| We're going to be doubling our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| This commission is stuck with some tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| That sort of gets back to the 22 cents that I've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| is that our debt obligation is much more than the 22 cents property tax that we allocate towards it, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| We get additional revenues besides property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| The schools pay for their portion of it, which you saw was $19.2 million from their school construction fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| and another $5 million from their operations, and that's $24 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| We get a considerable amount of interest earnings each year and some other revenues, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| But our total debt, we expect to be about $60 million this year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Do you feel that 22 cents is enough property tax to allocate towards our debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| Now, I know we have other streams of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| We have sales tax and we have other forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| I feel we need to reflect our true situation and we need to increase our tax rate that's going towards debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:16| Do you not agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| Well, it's a decision for the commission to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| The commission sets the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| Because we can move money out of the operational part of the tax rate into the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| to better reflect what our true debt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| And I don't know how much a penny is going to bring in five years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| but right now it brings in about, what, $788,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| Times the 22 cents is, what, about 17, not quite $18 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:50| So maybe in five or ten years, maybe 22 cents, maybe it brings in $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Maybe by then a penny will bring in a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| I mean, we're going to drain our fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| When our debt is now 60, I'd hate to think what our debt payment is going to be five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:16| It goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| It goes up every time we borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| Yeah, but keep in mind, we've got, you know, jail, we've got overcrowding problems in the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| And there's nothing in our five-year capital plan to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| I mean, we're open to pods, you lie, but it's full, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| We're still overcrowded when we open that pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| And we're still under federal cap downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| And there's nothing in a five-year capital plan to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| And we're going to be maxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| I want to add one thing that is not in your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| that I have direction from the mayor to make a change to add $100,000 of that $1.9 million that's going to be the school studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:57| to add $100,000 for whether it's going to be intake or detention center or to study that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:05| Well, we've studied that issue to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| We've got two different studies in the office downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| We just spent another $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| So that's half that hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| But that's half that hundred we just spent studying it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| I can tell you what the study is going to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| Your jails are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| You've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| You've let out all you can let out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| I mean, your misdemeanors, sighting shoplifters, you're not even taking them to jail anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| Your misdemeanors, sighting everybody you can, you're writing them a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| We went through this a couple of years ago with the criminal summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| They were writing armed robberies, criminal summons, writing them a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| Rape, writing them a ticket, telling them to come back to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| We've done all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| And it's going to have to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| You know, the time is coming where you're going to have to step up and bite the bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| And it's not in this five-year capital plan and all this stuff that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| saying that we're going to spend $10 million planning on four schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| That's all sexy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| I mean, that's where you want to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| It's not popular to spend money on jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| But, you know, we've got storm water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| You know, a lot of money we're going to have to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| We can't spend it all on frosting, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Libraries are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| Senior centers are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Schools are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| But we have to start spending money with the storm water stuff on our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| and keeping bad guys in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| I don't know when we're going to get that through our heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| but we've got to start looking at this very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| You know, everything that we're spending in here over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| minus one pot at the penal facility, it's like smoking beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| You know, it's feel-good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| Some of this stuff that we're going to have to spend money on, it doesn't feel good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| but we've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| Not to disagree with you, but if we have better schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| maybe we have less in the prisons too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| John, in account 6950, it's a miscellaneous shows like a million seven, 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:08| But it shows like a transfer of negative of 7,238,850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| Can you explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| What page are you on, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| I wrote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| I don't have a page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Yeah, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| And I think the way to really talk about that 6950 is just to talk about it without that $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| I think that would be the most direct way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| And let me just say that within we made several, based on the previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| the committee meetings and the previous public hearing, made some adjustments that were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| Have we seen those adjustments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| You should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| We passed them out previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| They look like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| Anyway, proposed amendments to the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| And let's see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| Yeah, what you've got is without the $7 million, which is, in essence, a transfer in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| is a million 549 in the miscellaneous, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:24| with the proposed adjustments from the mayor's office to go to, to try to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| And I should spend a few minutes covering those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| The expectation or the proposal is to reduce that by $695,000 to bring down to a budget of 853,809,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:45| which compares to last year's budget of 726.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| So let me just talk a little bit about these adjustments, and I'll go through them office by office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| and I think you'll remember them from the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| The county commission, the request to be fully restored, 24,705.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| Circuit court clerk, we'd have funds restored for 38-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| Juvenile court, we've got there court security for 119,250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| a couple other things that Judge Irwin asked for, for a total of 268,272.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| There's just a reclassification within the law department, no increase in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| The parks department has proposed raising their fees and reallocating within their budgets, totaling $58,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:40| Community grants, we had a few pluses and minuses for a net of 48,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070607budgetpart1?start=8740)|
