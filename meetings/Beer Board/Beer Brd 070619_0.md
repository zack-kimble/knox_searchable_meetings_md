| 0:02:07| Tara Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=127)|
| 0:02:21| 718 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| We need the sales tax registration corporate charter certificate of zoning, final approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| fire inspector, and health department task program certification in the final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=154)|
| 0:02:46| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Chairman, I would move to postpone consideration of this permit request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the SPHERE Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| particularly because the task certification has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| It's my opinion that that's essential to safe serving, particularly with a new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| and I'd like to see that completed before I'm asked to consider this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I guess before I second that, let me just ask, when do you hope to open by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| By the end of next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| July 1st, we're hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| July 1st, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| So this is going to affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| You've got a lot of stuff that's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| You've got a lot of redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Well, I'll go ahead and second Ms. Roddy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| We applied for all this information, but we didn't get it back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| We're supposed to get it back within 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| There's a lot that sort of sounds like it's stuff that you're completely in control of, the task program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| some of the corporate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| The corporate information is already in because it's been incorporated since 2000, I mean 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| We have another business in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Do we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Yeah, we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Maybe I didn't put it in, but, you know, it's like it's been incorporated since 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| Councilman Palo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Oh, I think I was about to make the same comment Councilman Roddy made and also Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| You know, I feel a tremendous amount of concern for you that you plan to open on July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| and being somewhat involved in a business, I understand how much of a problem it can be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| It seems to me that if I were going to open a business, I'd be out there pounding the pavement getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| And, frankly, I have to agree with the other two council members who have expressed their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=274)|
| 0:04:43| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| We're voting to postpone it to the July 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| The ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| It's been postponed to the July 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=301)|

| 0:06:02| What is this event that you're asking for a permit for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| It's a street party down on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=367)|

| 0:06:15| What's the purpose of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| That part, sir, I'm not completely familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| That's handled by the manager here in Knoxville that she was supposed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| She hadn't made it yet, Robin Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. Cox, you just simply take care of the concessions for that event, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| You're not the event organizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=401)|

| 0:09:28| Due to these disturbances and activities of the past management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I'm very concerned that these may occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| In March of 2006, our community neighborhood met with the new management and the leasee who leases from TVA Property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=579)|
| 0:09:55| And an agreement was made due to the neighborhood requesting that the activities cease outside because of the noise level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=595)|
| 0:10:09| And the interruptions that it caused in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| My concern is will they honor the neighborhood's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| and continue to keep the activities indoors so that it would not disturb our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=619)|
| 0:10:32| I don't know if you've read my letter, but it's pretty explicit on some things that did occur in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| And I just don't want it to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| And I would ask that the beer board consider making concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| or at least asking what the intent is of the new management at Croker's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=649)|
| 0:10:58| And if they could keep this indoors, it would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| It would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| So that the outside wouldn't, the noise and the music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| and the entertainment would not resonate through the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| and cause the problems that it has had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| How many people in your neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| How many homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Sir, we have approximately 160 homes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| We have Promises Child Enrichment Center and a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| approximately three-tenths of a mile from the Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| There have been many, many complaints in the past, not presently, because it has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=698)|
| 0:11:48| And from March of 2006 until late fall of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=708)|
| 0:11:57| the management did honor our neighborhood requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| And that's mainly what I'm wanting to do tonight is to see if Croker's would continue that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Have you talked to the new management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| No, sir, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Councilman Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Well, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| I received your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| I also received one from another individual, I think, which was a little more lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| And if I recall, I did not bring that with me this evening, but if I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| there was an indication that the sheriff's department had been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| My question to you is, do you live, I realize your address may be Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| but do you live in the city or the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| No, I live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| That was the assumption I made from the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| And I just will comment, or maybe Officer Husky would like to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| but the Knoxville Police Department is probably has, do you have jurisdiction there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| This has to be a city establishment or we would not be issuing a beer permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| The establishment is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| And I assumed it was in a county neighborhood from the letters that I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| You know, I just feel like you need to be aware that law enforcement, for you, involving this establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| is the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| And I feel very confident that they're there to serve you and to serve your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| and anyone else who might be coming or going from this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| And these folks are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| But we do not have any control over how they run their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| But we do have some enforcement opportunities along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| I think Ms. Norman knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| And I think we all would encourage the Normans to be considerate and concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| and aware of the problems in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| So I guess maybe that's really all I know to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Appreciate the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| But I just wanted to encourage your neighborhood to understand that this is under the jurisdiction of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| And it's a unique situation because we are all county and they are just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| Well, it's not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Well, to me it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Well, I understand that it may be to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| And it presents some difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| However, it just demonstrates the problems of having the two governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| but being aware of who has jurisdiction over a particular establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| And I'm sure, I don't know, Officer Huskey, if you want to make any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| I went out and talked to the new owners today out at their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And I'm sure she'll have something to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I just wanted to voice my concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| And thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I hope that it works out for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| I will make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| In the past when we have had loud entertainment on that patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| sometimes it would go until two or three in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| And I work in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| And it's pretty hard to rest at night and get up at 530 the next morning when you've had that to contend with for many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=915)|
| 0:15:25| And I do understand that it is within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| And we did try to follow proper procedure by calling the law enforcement to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| And maybe it will work out fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Just for some clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I'm not sure how many council members know the history of this place or how it got to be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| But it was under the previous, under the Ash administration with the council that, the previous council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| None of the current members sit on the council when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| It was annexed by annexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| This is prior to 1101 taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Finger annexations could occur at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| And the Alcoa Highway was annexed to the county line at Little River just past Topside Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| And then the county line splits Little River, running upriver from there to Old Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| In the Knox County, half of the river was annexed, only the river, because then the law allowed that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| And then the marina property was annexed, but nothing around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| And it was done, I think, for liquor license purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| But that's just, that's the history of how this came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| And it's very difficult for the city to deliver services out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| The fire response time is something like ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I don't know what it is, but it's long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| So that's just a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Mary Haddock, did I pronounce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| If you could come to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Could you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| I'm Mary Ellen Haddock, and my family and I live at 5029 Old Maryville Pike, and my husband, Jim, is also here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1028)|
| 0:17:19| I have a copy here of the letter that we wrote to all of you all, which I would like to have entered into the public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Shall I bring it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1050)|
| 0:17:47| I'm here tonight because of similar concerns to those which Ms. Cates expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| And, again, because we did have this meeting in March of 2006 with the then new manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1075)|
| 0:18:09| and the leaseholder of that easement and indicated that we really had been so bothered by all the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1089)|
| 0:18:19| and so on from that easement for a number of months, and that we did not want to hear the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1099)|
| 0:18:28| and have noise coming off of that easement, that really we were not able to sit on our front porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| to work in our yard, to have friends over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And this went on for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| After that expression, the person who was then the manager did respect that, and it was absolutely wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1123)|
| 0:18:52| We could live in our homes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| In the early part of the spring, toward the end of April, I believe it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| we got this flyer which was announcing the opening of a bar and grill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| which sounded much like the previous experience that we had had, that it was going to be very similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| And I want to say that it is particularly offensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and upsetting that our lives and those of others in our area were disrupted by such behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| which had occurred on a TVA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| And that is, of course, on land which is held by the federal government and leased out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| All across Tennessee, we're all used to talking about TVA land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| but I am asking that we remember and that we consider that we are talking about federal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| quite likely acquired by eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| and held by the United States government for the benefit of all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| A permit to sell beer on federal land, thus, to me, seems a bit more special even than one for beer sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| on privately held property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| The lease agreement establishes a high standard of use for easement property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| for the benefit and protection of all the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| In doing so, the United States government, that is, the grantor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| might even be providing some backup help to localities in dealing with problems on easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1231)|
| 0:20:40| Because the easement agreement states that the leaseholder, that is, they refer to as the grantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| will not permit any offensive use of the easement and will comply with all local, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| and federal laws and regulations, the Beer Ordinance, the North Ordinance, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Both of which, by the way, I think make pretty impressive reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| I've been reading those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| And despite the fact that these are new applicants, new applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| we just want to say that whatever we've not really heard what the plan of operation is for this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1277)|
| 0:21:28| But should it include use of the outside deck and music and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| we ask your help in ensuring that we and our neighbors not experience, really not go through, to be very honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1295)|
| 0:21:45| the noise and disorderly behavior that you've been made aware of in the letters and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| and probably telephone calls that you've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| And we also ask that you may consider issuing the permit with some conditions that might be monitored and enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| to ensure that the operation, which we trust and hope it will be, will be respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| and mindful of the applicable laws, which I might say were on the books at the time this happened in 2005 and 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1332)|
| 0:22:23| that this can be a good neighbor to our residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And we ask that the outside deck be closed for use or certainly the kind of use that it was put to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| with music and noise that carried everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| And that we really would hope that the entertainment and patron noise from the operation could be taken inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| and stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| We live, my husband and I, live over a thousand feet from this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| And I am telling you the truth that for months we could not enjoy being in our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and we don't want to have to go through that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| And we are asking your help for this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And I thank you very much for your considering these comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| and for the opportunity to speak before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Council Member Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Mr. Swanson, I think all of us are sensitive to the issues and the inconvenience that the past tenants of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1413)|
| 0:23:43| property have caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| And I know we'd like to hear from the applicant in terms of her plans for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| But what are our parameters in terms of the beer board and the issuance of this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Do we have the authority to attach any kind of parameters or restrictions to this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1435)|
| 0:24:05| Essentially, the issues that are raised about the contractual language in the lease agreement with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| the lease agreement with TVA is actually a private agreement between the parties to that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| and must be enforced or not enforced by the parties to the contract as those parties see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| The city of Knoxville is not a party to that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| So that's not something you have any authority over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Obviously, the city does have zoning regulations which would be enforced by our codes enforcement people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| We have a noise ordinance which would be enforced by the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Beyond that, the city has no legal authority, no legal permission to grant a conditional permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| You have to look at whether the applicant qualifies under the current city law for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| and state law for the issuance of a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| And if they do, acting in your administrative capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| your only available alternative is either to grant the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| or not grant the permit consistent with what the law provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Chairman Hall, would it be appropriate to hear from the applicant at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| First of all, the name of our business is Croker's Lakeside Grill and Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| That means grill first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| It's not going to be a nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| It's not going to be a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| I have three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I am from North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| My husband and I moved here two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| My dream was to open up a restaurant on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| We love the patio on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| I do understand the applicant does live that close, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| She lives right behind the patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| I've had a few people that have come to me about music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| I understand about the problems before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| What my husband and I have talked about was maybe doing some acoustic music with a guitar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| and one or two people only on special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| Maybe, I don't know, maybe on a holiday at Christmas time, July 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| Just special occasions, not every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| I don't want to have a live band out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I don't want a rowdy bunch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| I don't have the Knoxville police or anybody being called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| It shouldn't be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I am, like I said, I have three kids and I have family, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| I want this to be a family establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| What we're planning on is this to be like a small Chili's, Applebee's on a smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1630)|
| 0:27:20| But as far as the music, that's not really going to be a problem anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| I feel like with acoustic music, we do have a stereo in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| It's a CD player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| And I have turned it up to see how loud I could hear outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| I don't think that's a problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I know I've heard that they've had speakers outside before, and that wasn't going to be the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| I don't think it would be a problem anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| And if so, if it was to be a problem, I would expect them to come to me first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| And then I would, I could take care of that problem without calling anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1684)|
| 0:28:13| I don't know that there's going to be any other problems there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I was not sure about the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| I know in North Carolina there is some noise ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| And if I had somebody out there, I would definitely go by those ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1706)|
| 0:28:36| Councilman Hoquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| The primary leaseholder or easement holder is David Kiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| And I see he's here, and I just wondered if he'd like to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Within the context or understanding that this, as Mr. Swanson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| that there's very little discretion this board has in these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I appreciate you all letting me speak for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| This has been a problem at this location with the previous two tenants that we've had out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| And last year it came to a full head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| and that's when I decided to get a little more involved and I called a community meeting to all the neighborhoods around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| And that's when they really made us aware of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| And we said, okay, we're not going to do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| And I would like to think that we held true to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| And we've had several people that expressed a lot of interest in renting that establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| And I'm not sure about the flyer that she got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| but I'm assuming that that's from one of the people that we had talked to that we did not lease to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| When we met the Normans, we said, okay, this is the fit that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| We have talked to them several times over and over about the bands and the music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| And they seem to be 100 percent on the same page with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| And I think the biggest challenge is if there's a community issue that they talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| My number is in the phone book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| They can call me at 3 o'clock in the morning if there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| The Normans are easily reachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| And I think that we want to make sure that we take care of the people that live around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| The residents of those neighborhoods will ensure the viability of that restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| And without them, that restaurant will not succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| It's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And we will do whatever we have to to make sure that stays in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Ideally, the residents should go through the Normans if there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| But if not, they've always got me as a backup and I'm easily reachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Yeah, this is just I think, Chicago, I think it's good to talk about, you know, easily reachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| I think that's a good answer for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Can I ask both of you all to make sure that the people that have spoken and any of the folks in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| that before you leave, they've got your phone number so they don't even have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| That will be a help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I'm prepared to make a motion if we have heard all we need to hear from either Mr. Kiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| I would be either from Mr. Kiger or from Ms. Norman because you all have had your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| I just feel that before I make that motion, I want to say something that is just kind of maybe old school-ish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1868)|
| 0:31:18| and grandma-ish, but I want to say everybody needs to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| Mr. Kiger has made an absolutely emphatically important statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| and that is the viability of this as a family restaurant will depend upon the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| And I truly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| You had the restaurant, Mr. Kiger, we used to have a little boat and we used to pull up there and eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| And it was just a great experience for our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| And I think there need to be more places like that on the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| and I hope that that is what we're hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| And it seems to me it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| So, consequently, I'm going to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=1921)|

| 0:33:33| I still had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| It will work for this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Sir, I think you have probably earlier heard in this meeting how important we feel the task program is to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| I'm very familiar with that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It's in the district I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| And it's an establishment that has had some problems in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| And I wish you good luck there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| But I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this permit until the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| and particularly so that you can complete the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I think I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| I mean, I think this is maybe something we'll be taking up at the workshop later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| The task program, to my mind, in and of itself, isn't enough of a reason to postpone one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| And only partly because it's just a checkmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| There's no it's either done or it's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And they won't get the permit until it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| So while I think it's a good thing to talk about, if there were other items that weren't done that were under the owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| control, I could see postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| But I don't quite get this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Ms. Martin, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| I wanted to just remind you that when you approve subject to final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| and this decision is totally within your purview and you may do as you see best, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| but the beer permit will not be released until all the documentation is in the file and is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Would you just repeat what is still outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| We don't have the final inspection from the building inspector, fire inspector, or health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| And we don't have task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| And I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| I'd like to respond to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| How come you don't have these in or where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Would you like to tell us where you are in doing all these things and why you haven't done them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Because I'm in agreement with the last couple of statements that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| you don't get your permit until you do all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| But, you know, when you come before us up here and, you know, I'm just curious why you haven't done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| Well, first of all, we saw, you know, just to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| We just moved, you know, there's, you know, some food and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| and then we feel not, you know, there's space not enough so we just, you know, to move a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2171)|
| 0:36:22| Well, you know, we've talked about having this workshop for a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| long time because we want to try to be consistent and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| But I'm like Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| They don't get their permit until they do all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| So I'm going to support Councilman Becker and approve it, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| But that doesn't mean that I don't take the task program and these other things lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2203)|
| 0:36:53| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Councilman Pivo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| When did you plan to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| In two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I'm familiar with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And I know that you have just begun to work there, as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| And I feel like you're not ready for those inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And I feel like that tax certification can come in the meantime is the reason I recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| So you won't be opening before July 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| July 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Yeah, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| It is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| It doesn't sound likely, but it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Not even a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| The motion that we're going to be voting on right now is to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| July 17th is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| No, it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| The motion we're voting on right now is to defer until the July 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I'm just going to go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| I think I will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Given that it's not a controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2282)|

| 0:38:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| You're rescheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| You have to come back on July 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| We have a letter in here from Ruby Tuesday's number 5117 asking that they be deferred until the July 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2294)|
| 0:38:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2306)|

| 0:38:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| We're waiting on health department approval, and we need a final business tax return from the former business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| You're just the new owners of this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Of course, I've never been in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I know it's right next to Frussy's, the sandwich shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| And you're essentially continuing the same operation that you were before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2365)|

| 0:40:52| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| We're waiting on sales tax registration approval from the building inspector, fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| It's been brought to my attention that they're too close to a school, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| within less than the 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| What is that, Thaxton School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Yes, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I'm going to hold a minute and I'm going to try to get a measurement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| But I think we either deny or we postpone, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| because it sounds like they haven't done what they need to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| So maybe the best thing to do is I'll just make a motion that we move this to the next regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2511)|

| 0:42:10| Fire inspector, they haven't signed off because of a we installed a cooler that had a remote cooling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| and it did not have a mechanical permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| It was installed by the person with the company that we bought it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| It's just a minor issue, and it's where that's the only approval that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| The state sales tax certificate is we've applied for it, and it's just not here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| The distance for the Thaxton School, the officer came out to measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| and we applied for the beer permit because we are located where I want to say suds and spuds on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2561)|
| 0:42:55| And we made an assumption at that time that, you know, we were going to meet the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| And when we talked to the lease, the owner of the building, we took a measurement from our front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| the closest to Thaxton School to our front door, and we make the requirements or we fall into the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2588)|
| 0:43:21| When they came out to do the measurement, they came and took the measurement from the back loading dock for the bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| And not that's like a common area loading dock for the bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| There's a fire exit separating us, and we use our front door for our purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| And I think that there's a question of in the law that for the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| there's a question of whether how the measurement is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| And I've researched multiple, multiple permits that were in that shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| including the exact space that we have that is located where suds and spuds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| We're at 2110 Cumberland, and we're surrounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| All of our competition that we're going to encounter, they all sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| And we're not going to sell draft beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| We're going to sell a perp, like a serving, with a burrito and a taco or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| There's no bar and no dancing and no live music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| So it's just a beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| And we're not going to serve any other type of alcohol other than just bottled beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I'd like to call upon Mr. Swanson to discuss the how distance is measured for purposes of beer permits, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| Code provides that you're measured property line to property line by the closest distance, straight line distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| I'm going to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| That would allow measurements from the back door of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| Actually, from property line to property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I'm going to withdraw my motion, Mr. Chairman, and substitute a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| There is, I don't know whether you want me to say this or not, but there is a basis where you might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| postpone because should they get an ABC permit, then the distance requirement is inapplicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| So if you wanted to give them time to get an ABC permit, whether they use the ABC permit or not, if they had one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| the 300-foot distance requirement is inapplicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| Are you saying that state law essentially overrides city ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| No, that's what city ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I'd forgotten that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you for the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| So suds and subs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Or spuds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Or spuds were there before you were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| No, they've occupied the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| It used to be Harvey Washbangers and then it turned into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| What did they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| I mean, was there a beer permit here before is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| There's a permit on the property, but not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Dottie knows the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Business tax records indicate that the business that was in there before this one was Magic Nails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| And there was no beer permit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Have they ever had a beer permit at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| When suds and spuds were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Prior, but at least two before this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Well, how did they get a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Was it overlooked or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Well, it was preexisting, non-conforming preexisting from a historic perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| That's going way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| I'm just wondering if we missed something, if, you know, why it would change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| I'd have to go back and research at the time that that was issued whether it was a preexisting non-conforming at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| I do not know why it would have been issued at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| I don't know whether it got missed or whether there was a preexisting non-conforming at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| But if there is a lapse, you don't continue your preexisting non-conforming situation if there's a lapse in the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| And there clearly has been a lapse in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| You know, if there's an inconsistency here because if he bought, if he leased the place thinking that there was a beer permit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| before and he's going into business to sell beer, then, you know, there's a question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| And I just want to kind of clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I understand the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| But if there's been a lapse of more than six months from when there was a permit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| there is no preexisting non-conforming basis to issue a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| The only other thing, the language on the property line to property line would have to be considered the property line for the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2868)|
| 0:47:57| I'm not sure that the law, when I researched it, is not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| It does not say because if you're in a Kroger's in a shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| and you're ten restaurants away in the same shopping center, you can't go to the back of the Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| and consider that the property line and the property line for the property or the property line for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| And that in itself is not clear in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And I had an attorney to look at that, and we were trying to, and I was hoping that you all could answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| My recollection is we addressed that recently and adopted a provision that would be from the leasehold space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| but still closest property line to property line closest from the leasehold space itself, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2919)|
| 0:48:51| We do that just on liquor stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| I was thinking we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I think we did it with respect to beer permits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I have to go back and look at the research on that, but I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| This is a bit of a seesaw, but now I've made my last revised motion based on what I thought was Mr. Swanson's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| But I think I'm a little less sure that we have a clear opinion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| So I'm wondering if we should postpone in order to get clarification on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| By the way, do you know, does anyone know the address of Thaxton School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| I don't know the exact address, but I do know that it's been in business since like 1930 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| I mean, it's the oldest school, private school in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| At that same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| 2023, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Well, I guess one thing, Mr. Holquist, I would recommend that we actually do postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| I would support your thinking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| But I want to say that the big problem you all have got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| I mean, there's this distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| You all also have not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I mean, you all need to go to the police department and get all that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| There are four of you that need to do that and only one has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| So there's no way you're getting a permit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| That's something we would postpone no matter what other things were around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| So that's something you'll need to deal with as well as the clarification on the distance if we do postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Jody is the primary owner and she went and did her processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And the only reason why the others haven't is because when they went to do the processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| and take the task class, the officer that runs the task class told them that this is not necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3043)|
| 0:50:52| until you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Once you get your permit, you can come back and it will be pending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And I had a hard, hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| And Jody will tell you, I kind of got real mad that they didn't go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| And Jody will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| I said, you guys, I don't care what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| That's not what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| You need to do this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| And she specifically told them that the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and the background checks were not necessary until we got approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And once we got approval that the rest of the paperwork would be submitted pending the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| and the task and the background checks and then they would be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| And that's the only reason why the other three have not gone to get the background checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| Can you check and just make sure all the people knowing in the task program know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| that we're actually maybe not going to issue permits until people have got that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| so that we never say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| I'll make sure that that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Obviously, I support postponement tonight since these folks have not, three of the four on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| have not been in for their background processing with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| However, I would like it to go on the record that it just makes my blood boil that we have this rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| in the city of Knoxville that we don't issue a beer permit close to sensitive businesses like a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| where there are children, or a church, or a hospital, or a funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| and yet our own laws by the same token say go get a liquor permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| and then that overrides everything we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| And so my hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| I mean, as Mr. Swanson said, go get a liquor permit and then you can have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| But I just want to go on record that it makes my blood boil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| because I don't see what the purpose is of having the distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| I think the only saving grace here is that they don't face each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| and the doors are not on the same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| So, you know, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Well, I agree with that statement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| I think it's something we need to take another look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| In the meantime, I'll try to clarify this, withdrawing any previous motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| and making a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| One more comment, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| If Mr. Swanson would verify the change in the measuring and its effect upon the beer code, we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| And just for your own information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| It's not in my copy of the code, so I'll have to check with the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| And we will research the history, business license history of this site just for your own information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3203)|
| 0:53:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3213)|

| 0:54:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3261)|

| 0:54:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| It's a white building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| It was previously Jim's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Oh, so you're taking over Jim's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3281)|

| 0:55:42| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3348)|

| 0:55:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3351)|
| 0:56:03| We have some legislative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| What's the pleasure of the board to continue on or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| We've got three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Let's go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Cumberland Avenue Taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3376)|
| 0:56:26| Doug Pickens, Cumberland Taproom, 2200 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| You're here because you've had 200 sales to minors and to present us with a plan as to what you intend on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| to prevent this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And I submitted my revised remedial plan, and if you'll notice on that plan I included the original remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3402)|
| 0:56:54| Our first violation was simply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| We failed to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| One of the staff made a mistake and, therefore, we suffered the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| The second one, something of an aberration, I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| We were actually the first day that we were going to use the patio that has been added to the Cumberland Taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| And we were actually out on the patio going through a walkthrough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| trying to figure out exactly how we wanted to position staff to keep this from occurring again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| With the patio, you've got additional seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| You've got another point of entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| And I was out there ushering people around saying, do we need someone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| Do we need someone there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| And we kind of got caught twixt and tween while we were trying to set up a system to avoid this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| We have the revised remedial plan, I believe, addresses this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| We feel our original plan with the revised plan, we feel confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| We have the means to prevent this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| We take these charges very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And to that point, I've brought my available staff tonight just to impress upon them the seriousness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| and the importance of this matter tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| I really don't know what else to offer along that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| but we do take it very, very seriously, and we try very diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| and very hard to prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Is all the carding in your place done at the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| All the carding, is it done at the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Yes, it's done at the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| The server actually doesn't or isn't responsible for doing any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Mr. Pickens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| I just want to let you know that I'm extremely concerned about the history at your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| The fact that these two violations were so close together and the fact that our business history shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| that in neither case were the individuals carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| It wasn't that they were carded and it was misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| They weren't even carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| And for me, being Twixt and Tween doesn't cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| You have a responsibility as a beer permit holder to ensure that underage persons are not served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| And as I explained, the first infraction was a terrible mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| At that point in time, we just flat messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| The second infraction, since we're doing the carding at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| the bartender wasn't aware of all the motions and movements we were going on on the patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| As I said, we were trying to set up a foolproof airtight system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| And so you require two forms of I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| And yet, I mean, as your remedial plan stated after your August violation, you were requiring two forms of I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| And yet, when we came back in October, not only were two forms not required, none were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| I mean, there were no forms carding at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| Well, as I said, somehow the cadet, the individual, was able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| as we were trying to set up our perimeter, so to speak, was able to slip through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| The people inside the bar, the bartenders, under the impression were doing it at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| which is happening every single day now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| And it was happening then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| It's just I was out there trying to make sure we had a plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| and I got caught pulling people off of their positions to enforce our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| And, I mean, it's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| It's simply what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Well, I just want you to know, from my perspective, I understand that you serve a very vulnerable population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| You know, we had a tragic incident just recently with a young man falling off a balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| And I think that you need to understand from this board that we take our responsibility very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| in offering you the privilege of holding that beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| And because of the vulnerability of that population that you serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| I just need to know that you are redoubling every effort to make sure that underage patrons are not served in your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| And, ma'am, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Councilman Pelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Well, I, too, take the violations very seriously, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| And I think it's very interesting that you have chosen tonight to bring your employees here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| because I believe that's the first time I've been aware that an establishment operator has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| And I've seen these young men sitting here and wondered why they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| And I have to commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I certainly think when you speak to them at this point, after hearing this more than an hour-long meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| where we have taken very seriously our responsibilities here, that they see that we do and that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| And, unfortunately, you have to rely upon them to be as vigilant as you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| This is a team effort, and everybody's got to be involved in that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| I wish you well, but I do think it's a vulnerable population that you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| I guess it is in every one of these establishments, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| But I just do not want to see you back here again because we know where that will lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| Well, ma'am, not that I don't enjoy y'all's company, but I don't want to come back either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Councilman Hilchquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I think Councilman Becker was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I'm going to start off by saying I think it's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I also think, Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| but a motion to send somebody to a suspension revocation hearing doesn't necessarily mean that their permit will be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| or revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| It's actually a hearing that might result in some of that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| I think I take it seriously, and I also think that when I see two violations that weren't carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| I think I'm going to have a policy of saying I'm going to move for a move that we send this to a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| So that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Councilman Hilchquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Did he get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| I don't know that I could say anything more than has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| That's in the district that I represent, and Councilman Roddy's statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| Councilman Pelos' statements, and Councilman Becker's statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I think are all reflective of the gravity of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| So I just want to echo those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| Now, what are we getting ready to decide here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| There's been a motion and a second to send you for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| And what does that entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| It means the law department will investigate and, if appropriate, file charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And if they file charges, then you'll have a hearing before a hearing officer that's been appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| to determine whether or not there should be a suspension or a revocation of your beer permit or fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| or other appropriate sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| What's the basic difference in a suspension and a revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| A suspension, you get it back, and a revocation, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| Well, if I've still got an opportunity here, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| The reason I brought the staff with me was to impress upon them the seriousness of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| And I think that, I mean, I've explained this the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| Yes, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| We're very diligent in our efforts to prevent this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| Not much more I can say to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| I just felt that he was making an effort and we had not seen any results from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| So, consequently, my vote is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Do we want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Yeah, let's call a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| By a vote of 45-3, you've been sent to a suspension and revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| Will I receive notice of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| And it is just a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| It's not -- nothing is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Don Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3973)|
| 1:06:28| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| My name is Kyle Schneider representing the management manager for Don Pablo's Mexican Kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| at 2916 Knoxville Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| I've supplied the committee with a remedial action plan along with signed affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| or signed documentations, current that all of our staff knows, the alcohol service procedure regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| a server manual as well as the bar class manual, which allocates 25 minutes of a 70-minute class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| To carding and service of underage individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4021)|
| 1:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Mickey Tease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4042)|
| 1:07:33| Michael Penrod, Mickey Tease, 2405 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| Well, you're here because you've had two underage sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| and to present us with a plan of how you plan on preventing that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| You're next to Steamboat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| Do you want to tell us what you plan on doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| I thought you all had a copy of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Well, the plan that we did submit the last time seemed to have worked quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| If you'll notice, these two occurrences are not close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| We've also been open for about six years, and I don't think that we've got but two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| And you'll note at the bottom of it, unfortunately, this was not probably the bartender's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| It was very loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| The officers came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| I noted them coming in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| I motioned to the bartender that the officers were in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| She carded them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| And if you'll see a copy of the citation, the officer did note that she did card them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| She motioned to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I was sitting over in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| We had a policy to confiscate any illegal or altered identification and call police officers in the event that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4133)|
| 1:09:05| Wanda called me up, and she said, is this okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| I said, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| The understanding that Wanda had was I was saying it was okay to serve them, even though she had already said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| I can't see what could have happened differently other than got the band to turn the music down so that we did not miscommunicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4162)|
| 1:09:33| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Well, I just want to make sure that you understand that I agree that when they're roughly two years apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| that that's not nearly as serious in one sense as the one that we just sent on for hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| But loud music is not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| And generally, this board's policy is if you come in with a third, then we will send you on for hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| And I just want to make sure that you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I have a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| I was provided by Katherine Brunson from the Metropolitan Drug Commission a memo that I will distribute to members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Beer Board letting us know that the County Beer Board is conducting a workshop on June the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| which I believe is next Monday at 12 noon here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And the presentation will be made by folks from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Office, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| in Nashville regarding the new Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| And any of us from the City Beer Board who would like to avail ourselves of that training are welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Any other business need to come before the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Do I get a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070619?start=4256)|
