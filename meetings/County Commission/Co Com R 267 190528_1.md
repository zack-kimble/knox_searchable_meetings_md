| 2:42:36| for this 2.5-acre property by a vote of 14-0 on the consent finding that the zoning would be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| with the Low Density Residential land use designation of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9762)|

| 2:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| Let's go back in the agenda to the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| I think we had, I'll call for, who's the property owner here and the one that's not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9809)|
| 2:43:36| Venture Land Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Venture Land Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| Is anybody here from Venture Land Holdings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I know we updated this when Commissioner Smith was the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| I know that we will need to send them a formal certified letter advising them that this will be put back to next month's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| and they will need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| Otherwise, it will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| I think it's also courteous of whosoever district, Commissioner Anders, to give them a call also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| I don't know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| I'm sure that MPC has a phone number on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| Send me that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| Mr. Green, in fact, if you've got your computer, can you text or send that to Brad tonight just to help him get a head start on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9851)|
| 2:44:20| They're out of Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| Yeah, they're out of Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| They probably didn't even know to make that long trip up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| They're too worried about trying to get our water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| I got that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| Did you get that reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| We've got clear direction on this one to follow up with Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| Is there any additional items to come before the zoning meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| We've got ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Yeah, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Madam Clerk, ordinance, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| Amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee amending Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| Zoning Article 2, Section 2.20, Pacific Terms 23 Zoning Districts within Article 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9901)|
| 2:45:07| and adding a new Article 4, Section 4.107, Standards for Use on Review Approval of Public Safety Facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9907)|
| 2:45:15| to Define Public Safety Facilities and Permit Them to Certain Zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| This is Ordinance No. 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9919)|
| 2:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| This is a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| This came to us from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Have you got any brief minute overview on this, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| Would you like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| This item was brought to the attention of the planning staff by someone who requested information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| on where emergency service facilities, public safety facilities could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9941)|
| 2:45:47| Currently, there's no clear definition for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| They're lumped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| Fire stations are lumped in with public utilities in terms of rescue squads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| other public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| There's no definition, no standards for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| no identification of what zoning districts in which they could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| This defines public safety facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| identifies them as a permitted use in non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| and as a use on review in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| We need to make a motion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| We eventually will need to probably need to do a roll call vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9986)|
| 2:46:31| and then schedule a public session for the second reading perhaps at our next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| maybe just before or after our next zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| That would be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Commissioner Andrews, you've still got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| I think this came up in the discussion of recode a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| and I'm looking at the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| I really can't find the definition, and I'm looking for public safety facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| Is there a list of what that can include and cannot include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| The definition is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| Is that Article V?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| And the current county ordinance or the proposed definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| The proposed definition is a facility operated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| and for the use of public safety facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| such as the fire and emergency rescue services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| including the dispatch, storage, and maintenance of police and fire vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10052)|
| 2:47:33| I was making sure it didn't get into the halfway houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| and the middle of neighborhoods and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| It's very limited in terms of the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| That's what we wanted to make sure that it was clear and concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10067)|
| 2:47:48| There's a motion by Commissioner Andrews with a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| We need a roll call vote as this is a change to ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| So, Madam Clerk, if you could please lead us in a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10079)|

| 2:48:53| have it. Okay, I believe that concludes the agenda for the zoning meeting. Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10133)|
| 2:49:00| motion for closing this meeting? So moved by Commissioner Gill and Carringer. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| for the delay. If we're going to have a public hearing, we need to announce a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| I'm talking for that. Do that at the work session. Yeah, we can do that at the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| session next month. All right. Drusilla, please note we're scheduling a public hearing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10158)|
| 2:49:27| this that will take place as our usual protocol at the work session in June. All right. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10167)|
| 2:49:33| you. Thank you for your help on that. And that should conclude everything for this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| of the meeting. We're going to close this one out. And I'll now reopen the meeting of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10178)|
| 2:49:47| the Knox County Commission. Sorry for making you jump there, Commissioner Carringer. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| Madam Clerk, what is the next item on our agenda? It's on page 11. It's a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10193)|
| 2:49:58| item regarding drainage and slope issues caused by new developments. I think that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10198)|
| 2:50:05| segues pretty nicely coming from zoning into this discussion item. So, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10205)|
| 2:50:10| We've got Mr. Green here we can beat on for a little while. This works out well. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10210)|
| 2:50:14| you, Mr. Chair. What I was bringing up here is it seems like it's happened a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10214)|
| 2:50:20| times in my district to where you take a piece of rolling land, then they make it flat, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| on one side of it they make a hill, which was not there before. And during this, two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10226)|
| 2:50:34| we had one on Bishop Bridge condos that within eight feet of a condo, the back part of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10234)|
| 2:50:42| slid off. And so you could step out off the condo and you could, what God it was, the guy's dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| kept falling in the crevice before, and he had to put about a six or a ten-inch pipe down in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| so his dog fell in, and then all of a sudden the whole bank fell off. You also had another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10255)|
| 2:51:01| just recently, you know, with all the rains we had, we had a new subdivision going that created a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10261)|
| 2:51:07| off of the 17 acres out there, and it made a much higher incline, and they did some slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| protection on it, and that came off also and slid down, and they're out there busily right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10274)|
| 2:51:21| redoing that slope. My question is, is when you do the final plan in a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| and you've created a slope that wasn't there before, who's liable for that with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10287)|
| 2:51:34| moving in there? Because they keep asking me, what do you do? And the only thing that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| tell them to do is you have to go after the developer and sue them, even though we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10298)|
| 2:51:44| the plan for that subdivision and making that hill. And what we're doing is recreating a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10304)|
| 2:51:52| when there was no problem there before. So how do we handle that? How do we direct that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10312)|
| 2:51:59| the developers have to do this, but our problem is what Mr. Green has before him, and then their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10319)|
| 2:52:05| approval plan is older and it doesn't address these new issues that comes up. So I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10325)|
| 2:52:13| throwing this out to you. What do we need to do to help protect the people down the road to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| a piece of property that thinks it's going to be all right, and then it slides out from underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10338)|
| 2:52:22| them? That's a good question, Commissioner Busler. I don't quite know the answer, but I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| look to both the law department and the planning commission for some direction on this, or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10347)|
| 2:52:32| to open to discussion. I'll start maybe and leave the hard questions for our esteemed and astute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10352)|
| 2:52:39| law director. Although the subdivision plans are approved by the planning commission, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| engineering components are reviewed and approved by the engineering and public works department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| The grading standards, the slope stability standards and inspections are all handled by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10371)|
| 2:52:58| engineering and public works, and I appreciate Commissioner Busler asking me this question before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| because I had a little time to think about it. The appropriate approach would be to review our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10383)|
| 2:53:10| current standards to see if they're up to date. I think Commissioner Busler mentioned that they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| be out of date. See that they're up to date, if there are any best practices that can be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10395)|
| 2:53:21| to review and revision of our current engineering standards for slope stability, for grading, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10401)|
| 2:53:27| erosion control. But it's a challenging task because we have rolling topography, and the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10407)|
| 2:53:38| efficient way to make that topography developable is to flatten it. And then, you know, if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10418)|
| 2:53:43| got, as Commissioner Busler described in our brief conversation, if you've got rolling topography and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10423)|
| 2:53:49| you make it flat, you've got to have a slope somewhere to even it all out. And how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10429)|
| 2:53:55| adjust that? There are standards for height of slope, for the grade of the slope, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10435)|
| 2:54:01| steepness of the slope, the compaction. All those standards could be reviewed, and if necessary, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| adjust it to address any issues or problems. But that's something that I think the discussion needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| to include. Jim Snowden from engineering and public works, in terms of the approach, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10453)|
| 2:54:19| if there's direction from the Commission, we can look at those standards and see what needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| done to update them. All right, a follow-up question, Commissioner Busler? Part two. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10463)|
| 2:54:31| We were talking about drainage there also, and since we've had the rains that we've had in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| past out here, we've found some problems that have occurred that shouldn't have occurred. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10476)|
| 2:54:43| had people that are building around sinkholes. Sinkholes are natural drainage. And what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10483)|
| 2:54:52| is is they'll start packing it, filling it with debris from homeowners around there, and it stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10492)|
| 2:54:59| up the natural drainage. We had two instances out in my neighborhood where it backed it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10499)|
| 2:55:06| you know, as much as four to five feet into someone's basement and into their flooring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10506)|
| 2:55:13| because they stopped up the natural drain. And I don't know how we cure that because it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| all along. Also, in drainage issues, we have people out in another neighborhood that trims their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10521)|
| 2:55:29| trees and stuff, and they put it down next to Beaver Creek, and it flows down, and what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| is it stops up the bridge, and so it backs up into other people's property. And they look to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10533)|
| 2:55:42| to cure the problem when it's their, which they're creating the problem, and they say it's a drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10542)|
| 2:55:49| issue, and it's really not. It's a stuffing issue. They stuff things in areas that they shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10549)|
| 2:55:58| be stuffing in, and it makes drainage not natural. And so who's liable for that? I mean, we've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10558)|
| 2:56:05| out there and cleaned out one on Crippen Road at Beaver Creek two or three times, and the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| thing we know, there's more brush filling up underneath that bridge. So we have natural drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| problems and man-made problems on this, and we need some way to lessen the problems in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10576)|
| 2:56:23| and I don't know what we do. I don't know what kind of laws we could pass to keep people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10583)|
| 2:56:30| using creeks and things like that to get rid of their trash and stuff, and that's basically what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| they're doing, and stuffing up those natural drain sinkholes. But anyway, I just thought I'd bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10595)|
| 2:56:41| that problem to you, see if we could address it and probably take care of something in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10601)|
| 2:56:45| Mr. Chair, there is not a representative from Engineering and Public Works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10605)|
| 2:56:49| Okay, I'll go ahead now. Commissioner Biggs actually chimed in earlier. Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| would you mind if he spoke to this first, and then if your question's still there, we can follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| All right, go ahead and name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| Brad Warren, 205 West Baxter Avenue. So I guess the earlier question was the slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10619)|
| 2:57:07| You know, you have slopes that slough off and stuff. So after the rains that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| the standard slope is a two-to-one. It's two horizontal, one vertical, and that's a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| stable slope. One that I talked about, Bishop Ridge, happened three years ago, and it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10636)|
| 2:57:22| sliding. Yeah, and again, like we were talking about compaction, if the slope has been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10642)|
| 2:57:29| and it's been compacted properly, it's just like roadways, brand new roadway alignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| they typically don't slough off unless you get massive rain events. But, you know, three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| ago, I don't know what the weather was like, but recently in land development on one of the sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10657)|
| 2:57:42| that I was in charge of, they had some sliding off of the back from behind the house, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10662)|
| 2:57:48| it really ended up being was they placed so much topsoil, and it was like a foot of topsoil. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| that all got wet. Well, it's a sheer plain. You've got compacted clay and topsoil, and it just sloughed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| off the topsoil and got down to red clay. So it really wasn't a failure. So it kind of all depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| I mean, we've had failures on county roads after all this rain. So, I mean, it's, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10685)|
| 2:58:10| vegetated. You had trees that just come out with it, you know, and some of the stuff. Now, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| massive rain is not the problem. The problem was created before that time about when we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| sinkholes as natural drains for detention ponds and things of that sort, and then people, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10702)|
| 2:58:29| it dries out, they use that as a place to put their trash and other stuff that stops up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10709)|
| 2:58:35| natural drain. I don't know how we check on it, but there was some problems that was caused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| But anyway, I was just bringing that out there because it called us to take care of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| Correct. So there was two issues. There was the drainage with the sinkholes and then the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| failure. Yes. And so what rules you can change with slopes, I'm really not sure. They're usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10731)|
| 2:58:56| pretty sound at a two to one as long as they're built properly and compacted. With the sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| you know, I guess that would be a good question for the law department because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| I don't know how you rate that. It does cause problems down there. We just don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| can't educate the people on what they need to do right. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10748)|
| 2:59:12| Okay. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Warren, I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| quick question for you. Generally, we have developers that are in the county that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10757)|
| 2:59:24| neighbor friendly, but I think one of the instances that Commissioner Bussler might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10764)|
| 2:59:29| be talking about or maybe he's not talking about, there's a specific developer on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| just fixed his sidewalk after numerous complaints. And now he has a retention pond that he's built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10774)|
| 2:59:42| and it's caused sinkholes on a 92 year old veteran next door neighbor's house and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10782)|
| 2:59:49| And he's got his garage is cracking. I've been out there and looked and went in and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10789)|
| 2:59:55| like that. So when we have developers like that, that aren't neighbor friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| what exactly can we do? Because his exact words to me were, is if I take him to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10800)|
| 3:00:05| I'm probably not going to live to see anything out of this anyway. So what do you think we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10805)|
| 3:00:10| change in the future without getting into any kind of civil issue, but at the exact same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10810)|
| 3:00:15| making sure that our developers realize that they have to be friendly to their neighbors as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10815)|
| 3:00:22| That's a good question. I mean, if they're going to be a good neighbor, they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| otherwise. You have to go to court and have to fight it without passing something in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| and then you get into lawsuits with what you can and can't make them do. I know a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10833)|
| 3:00:39| they look to the county to help. Sometimes, I mean, all we can do is try to influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| but we really don't have any teeth when it comes to things like that. It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| On this issue, an older gentleman that is a veteran that has owned this property for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10849)|
| 3:00:56| many years, a developer buys next door, creates a retention pond, and it sinks part of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10856)|
| 3:01:02| property. There's basically nothing he can do unless it's a civil issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| Not from an engineering standpoint. I mean, and from a design standpoint, there's no way to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10866)|
| 3:01:13| where those are going to be, those sinkholes. I mean, we had one on Greenwell Drive at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| well, you know. I was there. It's at the top of the hill. I mean, the real sinkhole was at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| very bottom of the hill. So it's just, it's amazing where those things will drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10882)|
| 3:01:27| So, you've been with engineering for quite some time. In your experience, is this very common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10887)|
| 3:01:33| of developers to act this way towards the neighbors that they're developing around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10893)|
| 3:01:38| Is this a common act or is this something? It depends. It's kind of hard to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10898)|
| 3:01:44| blanket statement. It really depends on the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| Mr. Warren, how far down the river did that bale of hay flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| We followed it for seven miles, and then we had to send it on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| Well, we did our best with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10919)|
| 3:02:05| He posted a picture of a bale of hay floating down the river yesterday, and it was pretty humorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10925)|
| 3:02:10| My wife paddled it. She steered it. She tried to guide it, and then at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| we just had to send it on. Okay. I could go down the path of asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| for a definition of the straw versus hay, but I'll avoid that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10938)|
| 3:02:25| Commissioner Bussler, I've seen cinder blocks and sinkholes, so I hear you on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10945)|
| 3:02:34| The other thing is sinkholes just don't develop overnight. They're done by groundwater. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10954)|
| 3:02:39| form from the bottom up, not from the top down, and it's done by groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10959)|
| 3:02:44| And then we've raised the groundwater level up, so we're probably going to see a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| sinkholes appear that's not caused by a developer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10969)|
| 3:02:54| So we've got to be kind of careful of what we're saying right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| That sinkhole on Greenville Drive, would you say that was caused by a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| That was 60 foot by 40 foot. Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| The reason why I'm saying this is I talked to a UT geologist over there about sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10987)|
| 3:03:14| and I've learned more about sinkholes than I ever want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| But they're there now. I mean, they were there before the development was even there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=10997)|
| 3:03:24| And the rain just exacerbates the problem. But it's always there, and it's not caused by a current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11004)|
| 3:03:31| action. And that one on Greenville was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| shocking when I went out to see where it was at. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| I just couldn't believe where it happened at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| When it started, it was like about three feet across, and then it just kept on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11020)|
| 3:03:45| And when you look down in there, it was dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| Okay. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| What I'd like to do, Madam Clerk, just confirming, does that get us through most of our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| Are we? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| There was one item that Commissioner Busler had mentioned to me prior to the start of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11037)|
| 3:04:01| meeting, and I'd said when we were setting our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| if we got through everything and had time to go over it before zoning, that we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11043)|
| 3:04:09| So what I'd like to do is add, many of the commissioners went to the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11049)|
| 3:04:15| County Commission Association meeting up in Gatlinburg last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| and I'd like to add that as a discussion item at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11058)|
| 3:04:25| So that'll be, yeah, we'll move that to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11065)|
| 3:04:28| So everybody can be a little prepared on what insights or things that you picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| that you'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11072)|
| 3:04:33| Otherwise, that gets us through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| So I'd like to move on to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11075)|
| 3:04:36| But before that, I'll recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| I was just pushing us towards announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11079)|
| 3:04:42| Okay. All right. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11082)|
| 3:04:43| Well, do you have an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| I have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11085)|
| 3:04:45| Okay. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| Excluding Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Bigg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11087)|
| 3:04:53| if you have a school in the district you represent that's won two state championships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11093)|
| 3:04:58| raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| I sense a little bragging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| I went to school there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| That's why they got much better after I got out after two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11113)|
| 3:05:17| But congratulations to the Bearden Bulldogs soccer men's team on a state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11117)|
| 3:05:22| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11122)|
| 3:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11123)|
| 3:05:24| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11124)|
| 3:05:25| Yes, this Saturday, statehood days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| Lieutenant Governor McNally will be there at 1030 at John Sevier Home, Marble Spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11127)|
| 3:05:33| So everyone's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| Okay. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| I don't have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| Our budget vote is June 6, which is a little over a week from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| Will you be sending out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| I'll send out a sample agenda before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| It will probably have, when I looked at our draft, it had four items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| some of which are like resolutions about the budget, about the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| So there'll probably be four items that you'll actually vote on at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| And I'll clarify out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| And once again, with the budget vote, each item is worthy of a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11164)|
| 3:06:08| or if someone wanted to make a budget amendment or any change right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| I'll review that probably today's Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| So you'll probably get an initial draft and then we'll be posting it for public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| Obviously, before the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11180)|
| 3:06:24| Will that be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| I'm just trying to get a roadmap for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11185)|
| 3:06:28| And obviously, I imagine there'll be a public forum part of that as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| Or will there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| When I look at our past ones, we've usually just came in and have done the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| That's why we've done all these public forums leading up to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| Just looking for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11199)|
| 3:06:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11200)|
| 3:06:40| That's why we've done all these public forums leading up to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11200)|
| 3:06:43| So I would encourage everybody to listen to their folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| I can't see any other lights on for announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| But otherwise, thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| We pushed it hard to try to get through the night's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11214)|
| 3:06:57| So thanks for working with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| Motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190528?start=11222)|
