| 0:09:52| It happened to be an incredibly busy day, and the ID that she was presented with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=592.74)|
| 0:09:56| they do have the scanning capabilities to scan that barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=596.74)|
| 0:10:00| For whatever reason, that barcode wasn't reading into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=600.74)|
| 0:10:03| and so Ms. Patel went to manually enter that birth date into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=603.74)|
| 0:10:07| and she just mis-keyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=607.74)|
| 0:10:09| It was an absolute mistake on her part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=609.74)|
| 0:10:11| She absolutely acknowledges that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=611.74)|
| 0:10:13| And in the interim, she has completed an additional TABC course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=613.74)|
| 0:10:16| I have that certificate, if the chair would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=616.74)|
| 0:10:19| And so she has tried to take this as a learning opportunity that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=619.74)|
| 0:10:23| regardless of how busy that store is, she absolutely needs to slow down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=623.74)|
| 0:10:27| make sure that every single digit is checked and double-checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=627.74)|
| 0:10:30| especially when we have a card that does not scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=630.74)|
| 0:10:33| And so those are the circumstances we'd ask this commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=633.74)|
| 0:10:37| She is very grateful that that store is doing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=637.74)|
| 0:10:40| but obviously that comes with the tremendous responsibility of carrying that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=640.74)|
| 0:10:44| She understands that, and so we are before this body asking for some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=644.74)|
| 0:10:48| to allow her to continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=648.74)|
| 0:10:51| And like I said, I can provide that additional TABC card that she received last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=651.74)|
| 0:10:54| if that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=654.74)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=656.74)|
| 0:10:57| Thank you for providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=657.74)|
| 0:11:00| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=660.74)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=662.74)|
| 0:11:05| Is Ms. Patel aware that in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=665.74)|
| 0:11:08| that if you're under 21 years of age, the driver's license looks like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=668.74)|
| 0:11:14| If you're over 21, it's this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=674.74)|
| 0:11:17| The state did that to make it easy for store owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=677.74)|
| 0:11:23| They made it idiot-proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=683.74)|
| 0:11:25| Is she aware that if it comes in like this to not ever sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=685.74)|
| 0:11:28| you don't even need to scan it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=688.74)|
| 0:11:30| Is she aware of that, plus there's also a red bar across it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=690.74)|
| 0:11:35| She is aware of those things, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=695.74)|
| 0:11:37| and she is now duly informed as to taking that secondary class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=697.74)|
| 0:11:41| And I will say that she came to this country legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=701.74)|
| 0:11:44| English is her second language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=704.74)|
| 0:11:46| and so unfortunately there are some times where her language barrier is not to her benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=706.74)|
| 0:11:52| and I think that may have been one that it was helpful for her to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=712.74)|
| 0:11:55| all of those explanations a second time through her second course that she took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=715.74)|
| 0:11:59| so that she duly understood that that is the easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=719.74)|
| 0:12:02| no-nonsense way to make sure that this does not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=722.74)|
| 0:12:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=726.74)|
| 0:12:07| And then the other thing is when we issue a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=727.74)|
| 0:12:10| and then they violate it nine days later, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=730.74)|
| 0:12:14| the community finds that unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=734.74)|
| 0:12:17| And I think Ms. Patel would be the first person to say that she is very disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=737.74)|
| 0:12:21| to have had to come back here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=741.74)|
| 0:12:23| And so I hope that in the steps that she has taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=743.74)|
| 0:12:26| there are only two employees at that store herself and one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=746.74)|
| 0:12:30| They have reviewed their protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=750.74)|
| 0:12:32| They have reviewed that their standard has to be 100% compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=752.74)|
| 0:12:35| or this just isn't going to work, and she certainly understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=755.74)|
| 0:12:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=762.74)|
| 0:12:47| Seeing none, I'll turn this over to Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=767.74)|
| 0:12:51| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=771.74)|
| 0:12:54| I do commend Ms. Patel for operating a business in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=774.74)|
| 0:13:00| We like to see businesses thriving in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=780.74)|
| 0:13:03| However, I do echo my colleague's concerns about the nine days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=783.74)|
| 0:13:07| and I think it is true the community would be quite disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=787.74)|
| 0:13:13| And in keeping with our protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=793.74)|
| 0:13:16| I am going to offer a motion that we follow our precedent on first offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=796.74)|
| 0:13:24| However, if there is a second offense, especially in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=804.74)|
| 0:13:30| I don't think this body will be disposed to be quite as lenient as we normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=810.74)|
| 0:13:37| Maybe lenient is not the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=817.74)|
| 0:13:39| but we might have to break precedent if a second offense occurs too short a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=819.74)|
| 0:13:43| So I will offer a motion that we impose a 30-day suspension of the beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=823.74)|
| 0:13:49| or a $1,000 fine, whichever the owner would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=829.74)|
| 0:13:55| Ms. Patel would appreciate the Commission's leniency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=835.74)|
| 0:13:58| and appreciation of the understanding of her circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=838.74)|
| 0:14:01| She'd be happy to pay that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=841.74)|
| 0:14:03| So my motion, Madam Chair, is a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=843.74)|
| 0:14:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=845.74)|

| 0:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=848.74)|
| 0:14:09| We have a motion for a $1,000 fine by Mr. Beeler, second by Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=849.74)|
| 0:14:13| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=853.74)|
| 0:14:15| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=855.74)|
| 0:14:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=858.74)|
| 0:14:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=859.74)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=860.74)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=862.74)|
| 0:14:23| Have a nice day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=863.74)|

| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=937.74)|
| 0:15:38| I was going to let Mr. Buch call on the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=938.74)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=942.74)|
| 0:15:44| On June 29th, Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an underage alcohol compliance check at Ellestone Market, 8001 Millertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=944.74)|
| 0:15:54| The underage person was able to purchase a white claw, and the clerk did not check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=954.74)|
| 0:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=961.74)|
| 0:16:02| You have the right to either admit or deny these allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=962.74)|
| 0:16:06| If you admit them, then you will be able to address this board however else you want to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=966.74)|
| 0:16:12| So do you admit or deny the sheriff's allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=972.74)|
| 0:16:20| I just tell, like, every employee, like, you check every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=980.74)|
| 0:16:25| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=985.74)|
| 0:16:26| First, step one, you just either admit or deny what the sheriff has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=986.74)|
| 0:16:31| Did somebody sell beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=991.74)|
| 0:16:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=994.74)|
| 0:16:35| You admit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=995.74)|
| 0:16:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=996.74)|

| 0:18:30| Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1110.74)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1111.74)|
| 0:18:33| Has the employee that sold the alcohol to the underage person, has that employee taken a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1113.74)|
| 0:18:44| He just working on right now because he just, like, not even one month, so he just started and is, like, in the process, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1124.74)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1135.74)|
| 0:18:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1136.74)|
| 0:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1137.74)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1139.74)|
| 0:19:08| Well, no, he shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1148.74)|
| 0:19:09| I mean, I would assume that employee needs to complete that training course before they sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1149.74)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1156.74)|
| 0:19:21| Well, I see your permit was issued in 2021, so you've made it a lot more than nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1161.74)|
| 0:19:30| So I do love your store, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1170.74)|
| 0:19:33| I come in there about three times a week, not to buy beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1173.74)|
| 0:19:38| I actually buy Ghost, which you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1178.74)|
| 0:19:40| It's in the Gatorade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1180.74)|
| 0:19:42| I'm sure I just always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1182.74)|
| 0:19:44| No, no, it's all good, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1184.74)|
| 0:19:49| Again, you know, it's obviously not a laughing matter, and I would just encourage you, please take every measure you can to make sure this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1189.74)|
| 0:19:58| This is a community establishment, as we know, and these things tend to attract a lot of underage traffic if kids think they can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1198.74)|
| 0:20:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1210.74)|
| 0:20:13| So I'll offer a motion, Madam Chair, that we impose a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension of the license, whichever the owner would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1213.74)|
| 0:20:22| I'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1222.74)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1224.74)|
| 0:20:25| That's my motion, then, $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1225.74)|
| 0:20:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1228.74)|
| 0:20:29| We have a motion on the floor by Beeler, second by Ward to accept the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1229.74)|
| 0:20:34| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1234.74)|
| 0:20:36| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1236.74)|
| 0:20:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1238.74)|
| 0:20:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1239.74)|
| 0:20:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1240.74)|

| 0:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1242.74)|
| 0:20:47| Next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1247.74)|
| 0:20:58| When we add it to agenda, the discussion of the state inspection beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1258.74)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1264.74)|
| 0:21:05| This was an item added by Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1265.74)|
| 0:21:09| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1269.74)|
| 0:21:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1270.74)|
| 0:21:13| Mr. Law Director, have you and Mr. Moyers had a discussion about this by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1273.74)|
| 0:21:21| I can't recall that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1281.74)|
| 0:21:23| What precisely is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1283.74)|
| 0:21:25| I've had a discussion with Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1285.74)|
| 0:21:27| Last month we approved a beer permit for John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1287.74)|
| 0:21:33| The holdup was he could not sell his business because the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1293.74)|
| 0:21:37| would not go out and inspect until the transaction was completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1297.74)|
| 0:21:42| which is totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1302.74)|
| 0:21:45| So it held up the sale for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1305.74)|
| 0:21:48| I asked Mr. Moyers to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1308.74)|
| 0:21:51| I'm not putting any words in his mouth because he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1311.74)|
| 0:21:54| It's my understanding that we can't issue a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1314.74)|
| 0:21:58| even if the state does not send in that letter of inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1318.74)|
| 0:22:04| we can issue that according to our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1324.74)|
| 0:22:06| So we might need to take this discussion up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1326.74)|
| 0:22:11| We can't hold, even though I don't drink beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1331.74)|
| 0:22:14| and I wish it was never invented as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1334.74)|
| 0:22:18| but we cannot hold up a business from being sold or opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1338.74)|
| 0:22:24| because the state of Tennessee don't want to go and do a health inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1344.74)|
| 0:22:29| I agree with that, and I don't know why it got turned away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1349.74)|
| 0:22:33| from the health department to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1353.74)|
| 0:22:37| Because as soon as you get the bureaucracy of the state, you're exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1357.74)|
| 0:22:41| and it's not fair in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1361.74)|
| 0:22:46| I don't know why we can't get it back with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1366.74)|
| 0:22:49| because they can act as they used to do and sit down there and say yea or nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1369.74)|
| 0:22:56| I don't know the answer and how to get around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1376.74)|
| 0:22:58| and I don't know why it got transferred to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1378.74)|
| 0:23:03| Anything to do with the state is just bureaucratic mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1383.74)|
| 0:23:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker says we're the only county in the state that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1391.74)|
| 0:23:17| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1397.74)|
| 0:23:19| In other words, the state of Tennessee allowed the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1399.74)|
| 0:23:24| to do their inspections for them under a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1404.74)|
| 0:23:27| but we were the only county in Tennessee that did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1407.74)|
| 0:23:30| and that's why they took it back over under their wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1410.74)|
| 0:23:34| Am I correct, Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1414.74)|
| 0:23:39| It's new to me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1419.74)|
| 0:23:41| That's what I understood from talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1421.74)|
| 0:23:43| I don't think any of it's new until it just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1423.74)|
| 0:23:48| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1428.74)|
| 0:23:51| I have a question for Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1431.74)|
| 0:23:55| Mr. Daly, do you have a suggestion or a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1435.74)|
| 0:23:59| Well, Mr. Moyer said that we could go ahead if that comes up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1439.74)|
| 0:24:02| He thinks that we, according to our ordinance, we can't approve the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1442.74)|
| 0:24:07| and it's up to the state to go out and do the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1447.74)|
| 0:24:11| If we approve the beer permit, the sale can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1451.74)|
| 0:24:16| Then if the state goes out, which sounds like we need to try to get it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1456.74)|
| 0:24:21| if the sale goes through and inspection fails, it's on the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1461.74)|
| 0:24:26| The new owner has got the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1466.74)|
| 0:24:28| It's up to him to repair or whatever they've got to do at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1468.74)|
| 0:24:33| But they're not going to close on the sale without that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1473.74)|
| 0:24:40| They're not going to close on the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1480.74)|
| 0:24:42| I can understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1482.74)|
| 0:24:44| I wouldn't want to buy a piece of property that is now selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1484.74)|
| 0:24:49| just because I have to purchase it and then turn around and wait for an inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1489.74)|
| 0:24:54| that may or may not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1494.74)|
| 0:24:56| I need to know that up front, and that's only fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1496.74)|
| 0:25:00| All right. Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1500.74)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1503.74)|
| 0:25:04| So, in other words, it was a contingency sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1504.74)|
| 0:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1510.74)|
| 0:25:14| But if we issue a beer permit to somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1514.74)|
| 0:25:18| is it the state doesn't want to come out until they actually own that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1518.74)|
| 0:25:22| Yep, that's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1522.74)|
| 0:25:23| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1523.74)|
| 0:25:24| They have to own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1524.74)|
| 0:25:25| Yeah, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1525.74)|
| 0:25:26| I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1526.74)|
| 0:25:27| I don't know if the chair's office knows anything or probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1527.74)|
| 0:25:30| Yeah, that's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1530.74)|
| 0:25:32| That's what Mr. Moyers is looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1532.74)|
| 0:25:35| And it sounds like if we can get it back, we're better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1535.74)|
| 0:25:39| And it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1539.74)|
| 0:25:40| You know, does the state do convenience stores that sell food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1540.74)|
| 0:25:43| or health department does restaurants, or, you know, which is which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1543.74)|
| 0:25:48| And who determines which is which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1548.74)|
| 0:25:50| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1550.74)|
| 0:25:53| Yeah, because the state can't then issue it to the former owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1553.74)|
| 0:25:57| and then have that transferred, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1557.74)|
| 0:25:59| Because that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1559.74)|
| 0:26:02| The health department still goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1562.74)|
| 0:26:05| has jurisdiction over the eating establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1565.74)|
| 0:26:09| I mean, there's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1569.74)|
| 0:26:13| They can pass or not pass or close down an eating establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1573.74)|
| 0:26:18| That's strictly within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1578.74)|
| 0:26:21| Madam Chair, I suggest you put that on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1581.74)|
| 0:26:24| We'll have Mr. Moyers, the law director, tends to research and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1584.74)|
| 0:26:29| But we can't hold a business up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1589.74)|
| 0:26:32| I'd be happy to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1592.74)|
| 0:26:34| and understand that you have already talked with Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1594.74)|
| 0:26:38| and so he is aware that this is information that we will be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1598.74)|
| 0:26:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1602.74)|
| 0:26:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1603.74)|
| 0:26:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1604.74)|
| 0:26:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1605.74)|
| 0:26:46| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1606.74)|
| 0:26:49| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1609.74)|
| 0:26:52| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1612.74)|
| 0:26:53| There are no further items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1613.74)|
| 0:26:57| I call for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1617.74)|
