| 0:01:37| Pretty simple, straightforward process for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| We'll first set the agenda, then we'll hold the first part of public forum for agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| We'll jump into the agenda as presented and proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=108)|

| 0:04:10| Actually, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| I guess we're going to go right into public forum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=256)|

| 0:04:38| Presentations three, four, and five are also going to be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| Mr. Odom, you're going to present next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Then we'll go right to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| We have one public forum participant signed up, Ms. Carol Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| If you would join us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| If you would, please state your name and your county of residence for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you all for listening to me this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| and I know you have an extremely aggressive agenda, so I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Carol Daniels, and you want a county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| I live in Montgomery County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| So I am the Executive Director of the Tennessee Press Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and I wanted to just talk to you all about the ordinance that you have, 0-21-5-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=329)|
| 0:05:40| There's been some interviews that have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| and some of the commission members have made comments on different things about the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| So I want to just take a couple of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| and give you all a little background about the Press Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| So currently we have 132 members across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| And of those 132 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| they deliver a printed newspaper to over a third of the households in Tennessee each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=362)|
| 0:06:11| And then if you add on to that, there's over 16 million unique users across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| Now, we're in a state of 5 million adults, a little bit more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| and it's very evident that people are reading newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| whether they're reading them in print or they're reading them online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| The online numbers actually indicates that they're probably checking more than one site on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=388)|
| 0:06:37| Last year, the Tennessee Press Association underwent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| we actually contracted with an independent research company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| and they did research for us on readership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| and 82% of Tennessee adults read newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| That can either be in print or digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| And when we talked about public notice, one of the questions that we asked was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| you know, what do you think about public notice in newspapers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| And 72% of the adults responded that they not only read but expect to see public notice in newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| So I just wanted, I like to brag about my association, I like to brag about my members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| I just wanted to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Now, when we talk about the ordinance that you have in motion, one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| I'm sorry, I need to put my glasses on to read what I wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| One of the things that says that by placing public notice in a newspaper that is a subscription-based newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=443)|
| 0:07:34| that unfairly limits the accountability of notices to the only citizens and taxpayers who subscribe to the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=454)|
| 0:07:44| all notices are put on websites and notices are not behind a paywall on websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| so that does not actually apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| But also when, I'm wondering with the commission why this ordinance is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| because right now a newspaper, y'all, the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| can place a public notice in either a newspaper that is subscriber-based or a free newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| So I'm not sure why there's an ordinance to say that you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Now, part of this ordinance is you're saying that the newspaper that you publish in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| you want to put it that it can only be published in a non-subscription newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| And I just, I really, I question why you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| You have the choice right now of where you put the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| You can put it in either a subscription-based newspaper or a free newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And I just worry, like, you know, I mean, if a free newspaper that you're using goes out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| then you've locked yourself into, you don't really have a place to put public notice unless you change the law again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| So you also have in the ordinance that there is, you want to create a spot on the Knox County website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=529)|
| 0:08:59| which I think is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I mean, more transparency, the more ability that we can get to share these public notices with citizens is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| I just wanted to remind everybody that every newspaper that publishes a public notice in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| is actually required to put it up on the Tennessee public notice website, which is tnpublicnotice.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| That is a completely searchable website, and it covers the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| So, I mean, I love the idea of, you know, let's get it out in more opportunities if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| I'm just questioning why there would be an ordinance to do what you can already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| So, look, and I've got 47 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| And I have actually spoken to several of you on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| and I appreciate you guys chatting through the questions that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you very much, Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=593)|

| 0:13:08| I'm an attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I've served on the Board of Juvenile for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=790)|

| 0:13:19| Bean Service Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| And I was under the impression that maybe some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| commissioners were wanting to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| The service, the detention facility is probably the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| run facility in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| But some of the other facilities have problems, like riots and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| We end up getting some of the worst of the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| And in our facility right now, I think we have five people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| have been accused of murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| So it's an important facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| The people there have, the detention officers have very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| dangerous jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| And it's very important that it be run properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| I don't know that we've ever had a complaint about any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| maltreatment of any of the youth that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| We teach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| We have a nurse, a full-time nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| We have teachers to continue their education while they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| So if anybody has any questions about it, I'd be happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=869)|

| 0:15:16| Like I said, the facility is probably, and I think you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| have to check it, but I think it's probably the best-run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| facility in the state and maybe in this whole area of states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=924)|

| 0:18:50| One, improve traffic flow by allowing our signalization to be controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1130)|

| 0:22:18| and working with several others that have gotten involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| to kind of roll up our sleeves and see how we can do greatness out of that ministry, out of that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1340)|

| 0:23:51| with a first by Commissioner Lundy, second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you for your commitment as well from the private sector and from the community leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| We absolutely appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| On page 12, item number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| I think we had 69, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| We put 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Page 12, item 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| This is a resolution amending Knox County Commission Rules, Rule 2, by changing the title of Rule 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| from Chair to Chair and Vice-Chair and by adding a new Section D entitled Responsibilities of the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| and a new Section E entitled Responsibilities of the Vice-Chair to set forth the responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| of the Chair and Vice-Chair of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| This is Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| First by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Second by Commissioner Bussler to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| Commissioner Durrett, you pulled this from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I wanted some clarification in the regards to where it says Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| It says the Chair shall serve as manager for Commission staff, administrator such duties, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| It said this also includes oversight of the merit system for classified employees of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I have the job description of the director of the merit system, and it says that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| director is to report to the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So I did not know how this fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| And that's dated December of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| This comes back to the original document provided to us by the Law Department, Director Book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| and his team that, I'll have to find it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| but it was originally, when we originally started the special committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| it was to determine what department the Merit Council fell under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| and the Law Department opined that it fell under the county commission's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Is that accurate, Mr. Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| I can find the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| The question was raised, I think, by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| who's responsible for the funding and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| and it took a while to determine, and I think Mr. Caldwell came up with it and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| well, under the budget, it's you, the commissioners, that are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| So that was based on that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| The memo was August 18, 2020, from Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1602)|
| 0:26:51| The response was, the Sheriff's Merit System Council was created by a private act in 1970,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Chapter 326.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| It remained in effect until September 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| at which time the county commission, by ordinance, passed the same private act as ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| The ordinance, as amended from time to time by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| is the Merit System Ordinance in effect today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| To that end, the county and its commission are not constrained by the Sheriff's Merit Civil Service of Law of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| The county commission can alter or amend the present Merit System Ordinance as it deems fit and proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| The county commission can appoint a committee if it deems beneficial, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| So it sort of fell under the purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| and then, of course, Chris Caldwell has added that it does have an executive director that runs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| but it does fall under the commission authority, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| We set the rules and, I mean, we codify rules and anything ordinance related to it and the budget related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| I just feel like that's, for it to fall under the chair specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| potentially with someone with a position that changes annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| that means this executive director could potentially have an unknown number of different bosses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| if you understand what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Yeah. I mean, ultimately, the county commission, regardless of who the chair is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| is the oversight and authority of that entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| So we talked about this in the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| For instance, whoever the chair is, let's say we had a personnel review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| or personnel issue with even our manager of the commission office, that would involve the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Same thing with entities like audit committee, head, and merit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| I mean, there's just certain things that fall under that branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| and, again, whoever holds the seat is the one that has to be involved in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| shape, and form as it ties to either budget or HR or other related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1732)|
| 0:29:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I have several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| First, I'll start with the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Mr. Law Director, is it possible that the merit council purview is commissioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| but the administration function is the mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| The mayor as opposed to the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| If it's county commission's responsibility for the merit council committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| and the administration aspect is under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| You're throwing another variable in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| If you don't mind, if I can research that and get to you with it by the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Can I just ask for clarification of the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Maybe I didn't hear it in its full meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Is it possible that the employment of the director and the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| that's the administration of the merit council, fall under the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| and the council members and rules fall underneath commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| As I understand, it's more you're along the lines of commission sets the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| and the ordinance and then the executive branch executes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| That's kind of what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Okay. Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| You're going to be researching that, Director Booth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| I'll have something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| That's a variable that hasn't been in here and I'll get that answer by next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| The second question is this ordinance, this rule change doesn't address internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| There's always been that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| At one point, I know whenever I was chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| I researched to determine who was supposed to do the evaluation of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| It actually falls to the chairman of the internal audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| But, again, that is a division of the government that is underneath commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| That wasn't in there, so I was wondering if that needs to be addressed too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| I think that would be something to continue to also get some research from the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| because it was quite confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| And lastly, I may be getting the cart in front of the horse here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| but there are mentions of the development corp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| and it's my understanding that that will be going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| It may at some point, but that's still very much in flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| So I think given when this was writtenâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Leave it in for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Just leave it in for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Well, I think you can always take it away, but it's harder to add it down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| and given that it's still very much a variable for at least six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I had a similar thought process along the lines of Commissioner Smith, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| I had a question of should this body be managing people in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| My opinion is no, that we should not be managing people in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Our commission staff is different because they work for us, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| But I would feel more comfortable with the management of, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| the four ladies that currently work in that office fall underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| In my opinion, audit department would probably be the most sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| They basically are auditing the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| Maybe under the mayor it might be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| I just don't think it should be us in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| But I had a similar thought process of Randy's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| that the council itself and the office is two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| The council, yes, definitely falls underneath the commission, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| But I don't know if the office should necessarily fall underneath our management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| since it's more of a day-to-day personnel type thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| which I don't think we want to be getting into on a regular daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you, Commissioner Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| the goal in this rule change was to establish what it currently is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| not making any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| but we obviously need some more information from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Yes, that's what I was kind of tailing off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Whether it should, it may be right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| but whether it should be is a different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Should we be, I have the issue with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| maybe need to readdress this under a different resolution or ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| where they actually fall in the pecking order of who's managing that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Who has oversight and who has role and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Because everybody ought to have some role and responsibility and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| They need a flow chart of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I think they've been a lost ship for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| We need to find a home for them to stick under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| But the council itself, yes, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| should definitely fall underneath this body like most councils do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| But the actual office part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I do think should fall underneath a more permanent management structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Yes, I appreciate all the comments and this that I'm about to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| actually I think directs some of the questioning of my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| that have already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| I actually emailed Paula Taylor about this very item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| because there is concerns about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| some of the bumps that we're having along the way with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| And asked her, my specific question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| who reports to who and who does your evaluations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| And Ms. Taylor, you're here, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Oh, all right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| I'm just, I am quoting her answer to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| She said, job descriptions go through Knox County HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| and our evaluations are sent directly to Knox County HR as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| She said, I complete the evaluations for the employees in my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| and the council chair completes my evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| since they are usually my direct weekly contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| This is the way it's been done for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| My personal opinion is that everyone needs to be accountable to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| I am not certain that in this case that the council chair is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| who should evaluate the director of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| what's written here does not outline that the chair of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| will be doing anything to do with HR reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| It just says this includes oversight of the merit system in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| but it doesn't specify that the chair would be doing personnel reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| for any of the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I think I kind of misread that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Regardless, this needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| This needs to be fixed because I think anyone that is a Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| should be responsible to someone else who is also a Knox County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| As one of you all said, it's kind of a lost ship out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| It kind of seems a little vague in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| just as we are all accountable to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| So I appreciated, Paula, that answer very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I did think that it was directing that the commission chair would actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| the direct line of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| So my apologies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| But this was good information as far as how this is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| because this part does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Yeah, and I think there's so much of this that we're continuing to just learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| How has it worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| How is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Who reports to who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| What is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| I mean, we had Commissioner Schoonmaker talk about even the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| you know, and understanding of that oversight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Commissioner Biele?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| I think it is important to note that what we have in front of us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| really isn't specifically about the merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| It's about the chairman of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And so, you know, I would be okay if that line weren't in there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| However, I mean, maybe it does need to be under the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| in some form or fashion, but I do have a philosophical issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| kind of like Commissioner Ward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| I have a philosophical issue with a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| having administrative oversight of an office other than our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| So, yeah, I think the language needs to at least be either more specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| or not in there at all in reference to the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| I'm going to switch gears for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Vice Chair Schoonmaker, on Section E, Number 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| you're going to serve as the chair of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Is there any kind of friendly amendment we could put in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I think we've all seen the importance of sometimes there's a language barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| of maybe having a translator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Is there anything we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Because I know last month and previously the month before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| we had a really hard time with the place in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Is there a stipulation or anything like that that we could put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| so things like that don't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| I guess I'm confused with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| That would probably be a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| You're asking for a translator all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| No, I'm asking if we have something that comes up, can we defer it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| as long as we have a translator come back the following month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| We could probably work that into our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| That's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| And at the time the beer application is accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| a determination can be made by our county clerk staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| as to whether we need one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| So you serving as the chair feel like that's something that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| is make sure that we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Absolutely, because people have to understand what they're swearing an oath to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| and answer the questions correctly for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Is there any way we could write that into the rules so we kind of have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| That would have to go back to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| So that can't be a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| No, because this has to do with the responsibilities of the chair and vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| That would have to go under the beer board rules and as a totally separate rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| As a totally separate resolutive rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| I didn't bring my weed eater. I'm going to stay out of the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| Okay. Commissioner Bussling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| One of the things that's kind of bothering me is it says oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| and what is our definition of oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| The goal of writing this out was simply to document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| the way it is currently structurally set up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| Oversight simply means that it reports to somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| and that somebody is commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| The whole goal of exercise of this was when I was sworn in as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| there was literally no road map of what were the roles and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| So for eight months, I just took notes of all the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| every time somebody called and said, oh, by the way, you're on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| oh, by the way, you've got to do this, oh, by the way, this falls under you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| oh, by the way, you've got to deal with this personnel issue, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| The goal is just to codify it and lay it out so all future chairs have a better road map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| of what is the role and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| So this is just documenting the way it currently sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Literally the only change in this is the change from the vice chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| becoming the chair of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| But everything else is just literally mapping it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Per the law department, per the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| and per the way it's currently structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| That's the whole purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| We've never gotten into the weeds of what oversight means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| other than one group reports to another group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| The problem with oversight is there's quite a bit to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| if you look at other entities that's out there and they say you have this oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| and you go down A, B, C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| This is the oversight here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| This is what you're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| And what you're doing here is putting a nebulous term in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| that can be interpreted in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| I have a problem with that because it's not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| And that's what you were saying you were trying to do was define what your job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| But if you just put oversight, then I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| I think, like some of my fellow commissioners, I think just that one line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| if we take that out, the rest of it I'm cool with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I think we need to do something separate with the merit systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| which is a hot topic button right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| I understand the thought process behind what you're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| which is pure, but I think in general we need to agree with Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| in a sense that it's maybe too broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| and the merit system should report to commission, the actual council part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| but the merit system itself is the office body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Like I said before, I think we'd probably be best off putting that somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| We might need a different piece of legislation to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| separate from this piece of legislation in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| Perhaps we can get some more direction from the law director before next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| but this is only our internal rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| This doesn't tie to an ordinance or a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| This is just literally what our rules are inside of our commission body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| so it has a lot less merit than an actual ordinance or a resolution stating X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I get where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Like I said, I think this is good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I just think that's the one line everybody's getting caught up on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| so we might need to take that out for the time being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| and address that in something that's a more permanent stature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| where we can find this ship of home and kind of put this to bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| and kind of create a structure of here's where the reports do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| This is where they actually are housed within our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| I think everybody's just a little skittish of that one line there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| but the rest of this looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I think you did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We'll look forward to some direction from the law department on that wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Yes, that's what I was going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| to get clarification not for this specific rule for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| but there may be some things that need to be addressed in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| if the law department could bring to us state statutes, ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| that deal with the hiring, firing of internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| and the hiring, firing of merit council staff and the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| I'm a little wary of somebody serving as chair one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| and having the ability to fire people that have been in county employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Oh, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| So I think that may be something that we need to look at to clarify in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| So if the law director's office could bring us some research on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| maybe find a way to actually codify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| and then we wouldn't have to have it in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I really do think that there's a lot of personnel things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| that have to do with personnel reviews, compensation, time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| There's all sorts of things that we sort of handle with our internal staff through the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| but as different departments have different hierarchies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| that certainly needs to be outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| So we'll all look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| So with the way it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| will we have time to bring this back before us next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| or should we defer it for 30 days to give plenty of time to do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| and do it properly instead of just rushing into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| So the current motion is to move forward without recommendation until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Director Book, do you feel like you'll have information in the next couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| that might give us clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I think within the next two days I can have something sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| an e-mail memo to everybody in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| So we'll look for the information and direction in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| and tweak the language for next week if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| So there's a motion by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| and a second by Commissioner Bussard to move forward without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| item number 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| That will move forward, and we will revisit number 69 next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Item number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| This is a resolution amending the Knox County Commission Rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Rule 7, rezoning request and appeal, Section B entitled witness or city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| Did anybody pull 70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| I think I meant to say 73 through 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Did anybody pull 70, 71, 72?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Sorry, that was probably just a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| And just in case it was set to the agenda to be pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2794)|

| 0:49:01| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2941)|

| 0:49:49| I'll make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2989)|

| 0:49:58| If I could just take a quick, as a sponsor, if I could just take a quick liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| to kind of introduce this and the next four items quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| before we move into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Actually, yeah, sorry, we're in a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| I just want to start by just saying in these next four items that we're going to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| I want to just be very clear again to everyone that nothing being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| in these ordinance reforms will diminish any rights or protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| of our law enforcement or protective personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| It does not eliminate in any way marriage system's role and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| And I just want to be very, very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| The discussion around making reforms started a little over a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| when what seemed to be a simple rule change kind of got uncovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| and really uncovered a fractured relationship between the marriage system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| and its council and the Knox County Sheriff's Office administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| It also helped us sort of better understand what the role and responsibility that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| is as commission in the oversight role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| I looked into it a lot further, and what I did is I went to the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| because this entire setup, this system is supposed to be to protect our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| So I went to the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I started to get some feedback and asked them about the marriage system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Much like you all before we started the discussion, we didn't really know much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| It fell to our purview, but it was one of those things that was just sort of rubber-stamped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| and passed through, and people didn't really understand the roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and responsibilities that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| But when I got feedback from the officers, what I got was a little disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I got more than a few officers who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| I would never, ever take a grievance to the marriage council because I'm not in the club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| or I would never go there because it seems very lopsided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| or I would never go there because I'm just not part of that crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| And that sort of opened up for me the eyes of we've got something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| when the thing that is supposed to protect and be the entity for the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| is feared by a lot of the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| And that really sort of began to open my eyes about what is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| This is a quasi-governmental entity set up over 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| It's supposed to be an independent advocate for our law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| It's supposed to be free from politics, favoritism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| all of the cronyism that we hoped never to have in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And I think that it's strayed very far from that original vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and it needs to be reformed for the benefit of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| The original intention of looking at this in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| I mean this has been almost a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| how do you make it a better system for the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| So we do have a direct role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| County Commission has direct oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| We are the oversight entity, and so it is our responsibility to, I hope, make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| I would just ask you this tonight as we start talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| As you review these four individually proposed reforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| I just encourage you to look at them in their own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Please try to take out the consideration of the people that are currently on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| employed by the merit system, the sheriff, even commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| They will all come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Sheriffs will come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Commissioners will come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Members of the staff and the council will come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Just take the personalities and the people out of consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| and instead please just review and look at the proposed reforms on a simple test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| Will this make it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Will this make it more fair, more accountable, and more transparent for our officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Will these proposed reforms make our systems better for those that it's trying to protect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| And I just ask that you look at it objectively like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| With that, I'll open up the discussion with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| We are looking at number one, which is 73,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| and it is the title in your packet is Ordinance Change Recommendation Number 1, section 42 to 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| When this all first started, and I really don't want to point fingers or anything to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| but there was a formation of a committee that I assumed would come back with recommendations to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| that that committee would vet, inform, and then see recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| and bring recommendations for us to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| But that didn't necessarily happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| It came back in one long ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I suggested breaking it into smaller pieces, which this is somewhat smaller pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| One or two of them are still quite a few items as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| Three of our fellow commissioners had the benefit of going through that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| and learning a lot more about the Merit Council system and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3281)|
| 0:54:51| Now we have before us four changes that I'm really not comfortable with yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| because I don't have the research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I am going to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I hate to make this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| but I think it would be best to help all of us get informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and to have a process where we can go through this and vet it out and get to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| I would recommend that we pass all of these on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| and then have a special call meeting next month to spend about two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| where we can actually dig deep into this and interview and ask the right questions of the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| instead of trying to hash this out in a formal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Mr. Chairman, would you be open to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Yes. I want to make sure I just heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Your recommendation to this commission is to pass all these on first reading this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| with little discussion and back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| then schedule a special call meeting for two or three hours next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| Non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Non-voting, just sort of a chairman's briefing or workshop almost on this one topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| then dig through these in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| And then if it comes out of that without significant changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| then it can still be considered second reading in our July agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| If it had significant structural reforms, we may have to start the process over again then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Well, some could come through without significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Others may have significant changes and it would be their first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| But I just think in all fairness to the rest of us that didn't get to serve on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| we don't have the luxury of the knowledge that was gained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| and I would feel much better if we all had an opportunity to get at least a two, three-hour dose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| I would be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Commissioner Durant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| As someone who did have the opportunity to serve on that committee, we did throw around quite a few ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| We did not officially recommend anything coming out of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| And so, therefore, when these come back to us, it's incredibly frustrating to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Yes, while I did gain a lot of information about the merit system and how it works and the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| it's very frustrating to me that these keep coming back when we had that specially formed committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| and officially did not recommend anything out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Yes, we did offer ideas for the merit system to go to the new hiring classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3449)|
| 0:57:39| to educate the new employees on what the merit system and the merit council does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| and they started doing that in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, we did say that the sheriff's office could take up recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| and there were no issues from what I gathered from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| That could have happened, in my opinion, then in November or whenever we discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| If it was November or December, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| But I just don't feel like those necessarily require ordinance changes to make those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| So it's just frustrating that this keeps coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| And I agree we do need to sit down and go through these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and really hash out what they are and the meaning for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| because I have also spoken with employees, and they are terrified of speaking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| because they are terrified of losing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| And so I don't know, and I've gotten a numerous amount of calls and e-mails that are anonymous saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3511)|
| 0:58:40| leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| So there's obviously some kind of communication disconnect, and we need to heal that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3522)|
| 0:58:54| If I could just have a moment just to add one bit of context to our time as the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| I made one crucial mistake in that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| When we came to consensus on things that were recorded in the minutes and voted upon later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| I didn't take an official vote on all the things that everybody looked around the room and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| are you okay with that, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| And yes, we moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| I didn't stop and go, okay, everybody vote on this one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| I made that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| I'll admit that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| But when every one of those minutes was reviewed, and you guys have all been provided a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| I'll give it to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| And those minutes came out and said this particular topic had consensus by all members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| That was sent out, and every one of those members voted on those minutes that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| yes, we agree with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| So it was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| These are not new things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| These are all things we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But, yeah, there was a procedural thing, lesson learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| But these were not made up after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| And the one thing that we did not come to consensus on, we took a vote that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| It never made it any further, and it has never come up since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| These are things that we have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| And I, at the time, felt like everybody at the table had a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| But I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| We can bring that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| We can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| We can go through more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Commissioner Ward, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| I believe, given everything that we've heard so far, instead of trying to hash specific things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3619)|
| 1:00:29| schedule a learning think tank session, like Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| I think that's an amazing idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| But I think we just need to defer all four of these and have our think tank session first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| and then vote on them after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So I'm offering a substitute motion to defer these for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| put in place a special session for Commissioner Smith's think briefing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| and move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Well, there's not really a motion for that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Right now the only motion is to move forward with our recommendation on the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| Yeah, I just made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| So you want to make a substitute motion to defer item number 73?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| Yeah, the ones that Commissioner Smith said that we should have a think tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| I think we have to do them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Okay, that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| So you want to defer it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Yes, while we put in place the information session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Who was the second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| So there's a substitute motion on the floor to defer item 73, 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3685)|
| 1:01:34| with a second by Commissioner Durrett, first by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| Open the floor to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Mr. Law Director, do we need to defer 30 days or until a date specific to our July meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| It needs to be a date specific to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| You don't know when the 30 days will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Sorry, that would be the July meeting, which would be, we can get the date here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3714)|
| 1:02:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Commissioner Smith, was there a rationale of why you wanted to get the four items approved on the first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3726)|
| 1:02:17| Not really, just to keep things moving and to show a bit of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=3737)|

| 1:11:02| and get that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| I mean, I've heard that it's a cost savings, and I just would be curious to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| We can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| How much we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| We can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| I was just wondering what newspapers will be included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Where would it be publicly noticed, what media outlet, what newspaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| It would be printed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| It would be what they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| What they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Who's they, the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Whoever is making the publications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Depends on the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Depends on the notice, the department, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| It could be the County Commission has one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| It could be the Register of Deeds has a different choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| The long-term goal is to have nothing in the newspapers until it's housed all online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| So as long as the legislation passes next year, we'll be able to move more things to the online platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| But the goal is within the next two years that every public notification is on our own website that we control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| so we don't have to go and spend any money on publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| So this is the foundation piece to build the platform to start that process, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| We're going to move some things to the platform now that we can legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| and then we have a good feeling that there will be more legislation coming down next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| be able to move the rest of the pieces online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| So the goal is by the end of next year, hopefully, all the public notices will all be online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| saving us several hundred thousand dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Controlled by our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Controlled by our website, our people, and then it will be a quicker, one-step, streamlined process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| Instead of it being call this people, send over the stuff, pay them to put it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| So we'll save money, streamline it, and be our control, not outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| I just wanted to clarify because I get e-mails about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| there's always some political stuff versus whether we like a certain newspaper versus the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| and I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| I was hoping Zach was still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I think he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| I think for the 5% of the people that really follow notices and everything that a website is the best place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| I'm pretty sure that Zach would answer yes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| The ones we need, once that gets started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| and I think we eventually probably should get away from newsprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| that when there's a public notice that goes out, it doesn't matter from which department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| If you're on that list, I'm on Knoxville, Knox County Planning, and I get their e-mails every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| I talked to Zach about this already, and he assured me that we can create an e-mail distro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| So you can sign up, depending on what department you want to hear from, you can check the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and when they post, you'll automatically get an e-mail with that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| It comes right to your inbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| As we all know, we're all on those type of e-mail blasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Some of them we don't want to be on because our e-mail is being sold by whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| but that's the best way to get information out is if you really want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| you will sign up on that website to get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Any other discussion on Item 77?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Commissioner Busley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| My question is you're in the generation that has grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| All you had was the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| In my age group, getting that information on how to use the website out to the people that would want to know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| you know, you say you go on there, you'd be on that one to sign up for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| and a lot of people don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| My question is how do we inform the public so they could be ready to get this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| that you want to put online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| I'd like to answer that, Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I think that this is not going to happen next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| This is probably a three-year time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| so I think we'd have enough time in the next two to three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| to slowly start getting to our senior centers and informing our seniors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| They're the ones that are most informed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| It's the ones that come to our senior centers every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| So I think that we need to look at it as a two- or three-year project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| before we basically go away from creating paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| But, you know, that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| This will be a multi-year process, or it won't be happening tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Any further discussion on Item 77?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| The motion is to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| I'll move to next week for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Madam Clerk, Item Number 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| We have two discussion items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Item Number 78 is a discussion item regarding Parents' Responsibilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| Commissioner Bix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| I just have a quick few talks, talking points that I wanted to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| I'm glad Superintendent Thomas and his staff stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| I had a couple of questions more than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| and I wanted to discuss this and see if there's something that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| to maybe clear the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| I've had a lot of phone calls, a bunch of social media correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| over the PRZ zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| The Parents' Responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Mainly because what I've been told is, and I can see it for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| the walkability has changed, the bus ability has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| the crime in the PRZ zone where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| the amount of cars on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and how basically some of these major thoroughfares are now in the PRZ zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| that at some point in time may have not been that big of a hindrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| but now given the specific time frame that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| and all of the new growth that we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| it's becoming more and more of an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| and more and more parents are wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| are we ever going to eliminate the PRZ zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| Are we ever going to downsize the PRZ zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| And with the growth policy plan and everything that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| coming in with our sidewalk policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| we could kind of help shine a light on us for future development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| If you could just give your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| It's Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| I think before I can give you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| I need to give you a little bit of context about how we got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| Based on everything I've been able to glean over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| the Parent Responsibility zone was established in the early 1990s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| when the basic education program was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| It lines up with the funding formula that is within the basic education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| We receive transportation funding for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| that live more than a mile and a half past their school based on road distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| It is not as the crow flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| It's based on road distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| The funding that we receive is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| This year is about $20 million for FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| Our total transportation budget is about $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| As the PRZ was put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| my understanding is it was very purposeful, not called a walking zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| It's called a Parent Responsibility zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| because I think the board at that time realized that there are not areas in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| that are walkable or safe to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| I think over the last 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| there are probably more that are safe to walk than there were back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| The Parent Responsibility zone is codified quite specifically in Board of Education policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| It tells us specifically what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| For the high schools, they say that no student that lives more than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| high schools and middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| no student that lives more than a mile and a half from school shall receive transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| It uses that same language for elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| but the limitation is one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| The board is already paying more or subsidizing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| than what the state provides for transportation in that particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4792)|
| 1:20:03| Like I said, it is codified in board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| It would take a board action in order to amend the Parent Responsibility zone in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| The superintendent does have some latitude within the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| to make some minor adjustments for specific individual cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| or specific students or individual families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Those have been very limited over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| and normally go to individuals that may have a significant physical limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| that we do some work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| That's the background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| We have done a little bit of research on what it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| to reduce the Parent Responsibility zone or eliminate the Parent Responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| Our back-of-the-envelope calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| and that's all I can give you without doing a rezone of the whole district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| which is an exercise that would probably take three or four months to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| We anticipate it would require an additional 40 buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| That would be between two and three million additional dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| to the transportation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| In this particular day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| the money for buses is probably easier to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| than the bus drivers to operate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| That's sort of the environment that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| It's something that has to weigh on the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Should the board decide that they want to take some sort of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| with the Parent Responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| after talking with the staff, our thought process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| it's not something you can make a decision on today and implement it next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| because there has to be significant rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| There has to be significant personnel actions that have to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| There has to be significant procurement of equipment that has to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Our best guess is if you decided to do something to the Parent Responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| it would be best to do it a year before you wanted it to become effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| The main reason that I looked is, I'll be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| I went out to see Commissioner Daley's new bridge, which is very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| It's really nice, but John Sevier Highway, it is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| I can only imagine kids crossing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Then we have Amherst out in Commissioner Smith's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| and Oak Ridge Highway and how it's growing and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| I've just been going out to different schools and looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| and it's the rate that we're growing with new residents and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| I just wanted to bring this discussion, not only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| I'm sure other commissioners, or maybe not, maybe no other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| have heard anything from anyone about the PRZ zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| and kind of get a grasp on how much it would cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| and a road map on how we could either reduce it or do away with it altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| Because, you know, at the end of the day, safety is obviously an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| but I do think there's schools that are more walkable, like you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| but there's also a lot of schools that are not even close to being as walkable as they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| And there are areas I would never recommend that students walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| And there are roads I would never recommend they cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| And even if it is walkable, I would not recommend in most cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| that most students be allowed to walk unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| So that's why we call it a parent responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| because the adults have to take some responsibility for the kids in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| And even if we were to eliminate the parent responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| it would not eliminate some gap, because you're still going to have gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| between the home and the bus stop, or the home and the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| probably in the neighborhood of a half mile or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| I hate that Sheriff Spangler left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| I'm sure he could give us the statistic, but I'm sure people on the sexual offender list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| and stuff like that probably target lone students more than they do bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| And I was wondering what that statistic may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| I could reach out to him and ask on how that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| and stuff like that on the walkable kids and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| But it's just something that I wanted to talk to you guys about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| and see if there's any input from my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| and just kind of see some sort of direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| I know that we can't ask or have you guys do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| but maybe some sort of resolution to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Mr. Oaks, when you say rezone, do you mean rezone bus routes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| I don't think I said rezone. I think I said reroute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| If I said rezone, I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| You said rezone. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| So it is reroute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| It is reroute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Does anyone ever do a study to see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| I mean, there's some people that live 20 miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| that drive their kid to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| There's some people that live 10, 20 miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| that drive their kid to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Have we ever done a study to see how much the congestion is caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| because of the parental zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| and how much of it is people driving their kid to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| outside the parental zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| I'm not aware of anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| I don't know if engineering may have done something similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| or pieces of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| We have not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Commissioner Garrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| We currently live in one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| in the parent responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| We are .77 miles from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| Unfortunately, we are on the opposite side of Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| of the elementary school and middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| that my kids are zoned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| And so this is something that I was also curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| because if we were to be located one block west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| we would be out of the parent responsibility zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| and then my kids could therefore drive or ride the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| And so this is something I'm very interested in as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| because, as you stated, they don't need to be crossing Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| whether or not there's a crosswalk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| It just isn't safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| And so this is something I would definitely like to be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you, Russ, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| The parental zone, I think, is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| Commissioner Smith has got a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| I know that I can go to Mount Olive, Bonnie Kate, my schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| and we've got traffic back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| They're stacked up in double lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| And I think a lot of that might be grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| having to pick up their grandkids, you know, after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Elementary lets out at 2.30, 2.20, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| So that stacks them up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Mr. Snowden and I and Christy are working on Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| We've got a big traffic jam at Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And I think a lot of it may have to do with the parental zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| but I think a lot of it is grandparents picking up their grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| Child care today is $200 a week, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| It's expensive, the child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| That's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| I think I wanted about a half a mile on sidewalks near schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| and I think we settled on a quarter of a mile, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| We settled on a quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| and I would really like to see half a mile where we would have a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| there at these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| That being said, that's what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Justin opened the door for me, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| Mr. Bussler, if you want to come out to the beautiful part of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| and all you other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| go by South Door and look at this million-plus dollar walkway we've got there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| that's going to keep our students safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| It is awesome. It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| I think our next one sitting right over here to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| probably will throw his hand up and probably need one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| Your Gibbs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| But I would like for you, if you would, maybe next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| give the commissioners, if you're out in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| drive by there and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| There's more than a bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| There's a new entrance, there's new parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I think it's going to be safer on campus for the students there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| So there's a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I'd like for you, if you would, just next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| give us an update on the bridge, what the bridge, the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| what we did, what safety measures, that it will improve if you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| And then I'll invite Christy and also Principal Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| if they would like to come, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Thank you. Just two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| I've often heard it talked about in the schools that if every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| that could ride a bus would ride a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| we would not have traffic congestion around our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| There's a huge amount of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| that just are not going to put their kids on a bus, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| So I do think there's probably some truth to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| There is, and that occurred to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| while Commissioner Daley was speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| and it probably goes to answer some of Commissioner Smith's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| While I don't have any studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| the one data point I do have is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| about 40,000 of our 60,000 students are eligible for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| what we consider eligible, about two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| This past year is not a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| but in prior years we transported morning and afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| between 20,000 and 22,000 students a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| So we're transporting about half of those that are eligible for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| So that tells you what the other transportation methods are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| The other half are being driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| So that's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| The other piece of that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| is if every student that was eligible to ride a bus was riding a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| we'd need a whole lot more buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| We wouldn't get away with $23 million in our transportation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| We would, but we wouldn't have people complain about traffic around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Just one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Even if drivers weren't a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| and there weren't other factors involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| because this has been an ongoing discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| in the end it all comes back to the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| And really for the school board to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| and then ultimately this commission to have to certainly assist in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| the question needs to be asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| do we want to spend another $2 million or $3 million in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| that essentially has nothing to do with educating our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| And that's kind of a hard thing to balance from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5507)|
| 1:31:54| That's a lot of money that has nothing to do directly with the child's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| Just a couple of comments to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Mr. Oakes, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| Is the determination of the PRZ school board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| or is that an ordinance or resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| It's in school board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| So if we decided to pursue this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| we could perhaps have a statement resolution that says we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| but it's not our authority to change that PRZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| That's exactly what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Commissioner, or excuse me, Mr. Snowden, I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| Have we ever looked at, while not every road has the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| of being maybe crossed safely, depending on the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| I think we talked about this a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and talked about whether or not we would ever look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| what would it take to create sidewalks within the PRZ for every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| that we currently operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Did we ever look at that dollar figure or get an estimate to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| okay, if we're going to keep a mile and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| let's make sure every school has a sidewalk in north, south, east, and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| for a mile and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| I know we talked about it, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| but I can't recall us ever coming to a resolution on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| It wouldn't be a tremendous endeavor for my GIS folks to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| to more or less say every route along the PRZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| to build a five-foot sidewalk on one or both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| So, I mean, we could come up with that number without a lot of difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| I think it would be interesting to know if we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| a couple million dollars or 20 or 30 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| This is a big county with 90-something schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| and which ones have sidewalks already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| So if that could be provided to us at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Yeah, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| I would imagine it would be tens of millions of dollars, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| but I can get you to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| I would like to go back to the very beginning where Mr. Oakes started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| and it starts with the BEP formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| and what the state's willing to provide in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| And this is obviously an issue that affects urban districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| more than it does rural districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| So the best place maybe to start with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| is to get the state to go back to funding that last mile and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| in the transportation part of the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| Commissioner Bosa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| We're talking about a lot of things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| but here's what happens with our school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| and I've seen it happen year after year after year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| when a certain area in the county grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| Say, for instance, let's take Hardin Valley out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| It wasn't too many years ago we didn't have schools out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Because the population moved out there, we built schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Then what happened is we put a few more thousand in the parental zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| because we moved schools for the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| instead of having the population come to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| like it used to be many, many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| because we don't want people walking a mile or two miles in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| and we wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| But the situation is we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| We're going to keep expanding the parental zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| because we're going to follow the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| and build schools where the kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| so they don't have such long periods of time on the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| So we're in a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| It's a catch-22, the old move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| and people don't realize that that's a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| but it's a catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| You build it so they won't have to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| You build it and they have to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| So I don't know how you're going to cure the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| So we're just talking about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| We're not going to cure it unless we have a plan to say we start now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| and this is the way we're going to put our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| so everybody will have an equal opportunity to get to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| and put them in central locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| which ain't going to happen because the price of land has gone way out of sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| and we can't afford to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| So it seems like we're just talking about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| that we can't cure a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| I mean, we're going over and over this thing and it ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| We could spend billions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| and we still have expanding parental zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| because we're going to build schools where the kids are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| So I just hope we just go on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Mr. Boesner brought something to my attention when he said travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| I have kids in my zone that live in Seven Islands and Gap Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| If you're in the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| you're sitting on a bus for about an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| You're picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| You're taken to the high school if you're a middle school student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| There you're transferred, unless it's changed recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| which I don't think it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| You're transferred at the high school to take you over to the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| Then the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| At the middle school you go back to the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| and you transfer buses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Then you've got to ride that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| which may take up to an hour or longer to get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| I would love to be able to solve that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| but when we talk about present parental zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| and I think some of that may be part of the south Knoxville congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| I wouldn't want my kids sitting on a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| or sitting at the high school for an hour and 15, 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| That's mainly middle school kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| That's some of the challenges that Superintendent Thomas and Russ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5865)|
| 1:37:52| and everybody has to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| How can we fix something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| Like I say, I rode that little school bus with the wheels going round and round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| and we had fun doing it back in the days when we did ride it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| About an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| The point you made comes down to the crux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| of what most of our transportation challenges are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| in their time, distance, and capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| You push in on one and it pokes out on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| as you have to work through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| It really becomes a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| in the less densely populated portions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| The high schools and middle schools are a very good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| because they have much larger zones than do our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| They're much less dense in population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| once you get out into the further areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Discussion item regarding the 2021 Knox County redistricting and preliminary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5943)|
| 1:39:12| Commissioners, you have been given just one document here, two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| It's a continuation of the discussion we had a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| I just kind of want to update everybody on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| As you all know, we have the 2021 redistricting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| that we are currently in the midst of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| This all ties, of course, to the 10-year census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| We went through several things up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| I just want to kind of give you an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| and then present this proposal to you for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| because time is short and decisions need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| and things need to move forward in a very, very timely way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Back in March, we formed our redistricting committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| that included voting members, which is all of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| 11 county commissioners, our Knox County School Board of Education chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| and then our Knox County Election Commission administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| And we formed that by resolution that is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Back in May, some very, very preliminary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| and I will really, really emphasize preliminary data was released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| and that website was given to us at a conference last month by the comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| which is the sort of governing body of all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| That is some very preliminary data that is not final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| but it gives you, if you go to that website, it gives you an opportunity to kind of click through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| and it shows what districts have grown, which ones need a shrink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| and the process by evening out where our population is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| And, of course, the whole goal of redistricting is to adjust our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| to try to have nine equally balanced districts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| In June, just last week, I had a preliminary meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| with the Knoxville-Knox County planning staff and KJIS teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| to kind of walk through the last time they went through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| some of the things that they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| some information that I needed to share back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| between what the commission had set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| and just kind of walk through the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| One of the first sort of directives that was given was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| they are going to begin starting the building of a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| that will be an independent, stand-alone public information website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| as we start this process that will be able to be shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| That will include information about what redistricting it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| what are the laws behind it, what are the rules and regulations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| And then also it will create an opportunity for online feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| and a portal whereby people in the public can submit information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| comments, questions, thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| and it will be a public site because this entire process, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| has to be fully public and out and open to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| for all the Sunshine Laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| and all of the Open Meetings and Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| So they are going to start that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| with some of the preliminary information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| and then show that to us probably in a draft form next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| and then have it ready for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| We have a vote coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| It's on consent, but an official vote will be taken next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| on the resolution to exclude the non-voting prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| That, of course, would affect mostly the 8th District population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| but that is something that by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| with recommendation from the Comptroller that we will do next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| And then once that happens, the following day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| the Comptroller has asked for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| and all the documents that we've done to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| and actually a plan being submitted by the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| and the Commission to the Comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| to basically outline how we're going to pull this thing off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| and what are we going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| So that's why I'm bringing this to you today to kind of walk through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| and make sure that everybody's in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| or we make any adjustments so that that plan can be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| to the Tennessee Comptroller next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| What's going to happen so far, as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and this changes a lot because the U.S. government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| is changing a lot of things on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| We're already several months behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| but we knew that going into it, it would be a little difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| But one of the first things that's going to happen in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| on the 16th of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| the U.S. Census will release some legacy format data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| What that means is basically unformatted raw data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| that comes in, it kind of looks like the matrix almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| and it really requires some advanced data processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| Now, most counties that do not have their own planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| and GIS departments wait another month for the Comptroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| to disseminate all that and put it into a pretty form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| and then give them the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| We are very, very fortunate that we have both a planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| and a KGIS staff that has the ability to start working on that data immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| and processing it and understanding it in a way that's digestible to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| So they are anxiously awaiting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| and what I'm proposing to you today is a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| that looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Hold our initial redistricting committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| on Wednesday, August 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| where we will cover at least the things that are outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| leadership selection, overview of the entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| establish some ground rules for the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| introduce the public information and citizen input website and process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| review all of the legal requirements and the Comptroller directives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| outline our role and responsibilities of the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| and then identify goals and provide direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Now, the planning staff is a quantitative tool for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| that will help us do anything at our direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| They are not a qualitative body that will make interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| so we have to give them direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| and those are things like when we go through this redistricting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| it is our goal to make sure that all of our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| stay in their district, or each district has one high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| or we respect certain geographic boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| We have to kind of give them direction of things we want to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| and give them goals that we want to, like keeping neighborhoods together, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| Then we can review some preliminary data and maps provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| and then go through our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| And then what I'm proposing here is essentially a very, very aggressive schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| because if you sort of scale down to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| our deadline from the Comptroller is January 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| but we have a very important thing happening in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| which is people are picking up petitions in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| with the election commission from the 2022 elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| All of redistricting affects three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| It affects where you live and what your representation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| It also affects our school board as those are matched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| and where your kids might go to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| and it affects your voting precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| And the voting precinct, this is why this condensed version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| is almost incredibly hard to pull off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| but Chris Davis says he'll make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| All of that has to happen in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| and then people who pick up petitions also have to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| they're within the zone that they're picking it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| and it gets really, really complicated from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| But backing up into September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| they will do the final data release on the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| but we will have already had the data in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| Again, that's sort of for people that don't have planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| counties that don't have planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| The comptroller, if we didn't already have it, would give tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| but we're hopefully ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| And then I'm proposing two meetings in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| back-to-back Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| This is where we would actually get to scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| So between August and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| we would give direction and guidance to the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| They would likely come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| okay, here is scenario one, two, and three for this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| It will affect this next district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Here's scenario one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| And then this committee would actually take votes on recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| of which map to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Some of it may be very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Some of it may be very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| But those would be the voting meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| And I've taken a break between the 6th and the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| mostly because that's the fall break week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| And they have said that the first two or three meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| sometimes if we get stuck on something that's not so easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| they need a little bit of a break to sort of recalculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| and figure out how to solve that jigsaw puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| So two final meetings on the 20th and 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| and then finding a way to have two votes in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| Again, it requires by ordinance two votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| and these are roll call votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| So the first one would be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| and then perhaps we'd just do a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| But it depends on the timing of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| for when it really needs to happen in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| But the goal is to have everything out of November voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| and recommended out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| That would then come to commission in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| to vote on it in first and second readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| And then I've sort of left December as a buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| because we have a deadline of December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| So I've kind of left that as a little bit of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| If we're on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| then that's when we would sort of finalize things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| with both the election commission and the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| One other thing I put at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| this was a recommendation from the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| from the last time we went through redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| which was to invite some non-voting participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Of course, the planning department would be Amy Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| and Terry Gahula leading the charge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| Our commission office manager, Driscilla Stills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| our law director, David Boock, or designee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| and then two representatives that we would send by letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| to invite both the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| They would not be voting members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| but they certainly would have a lot of institutional knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| and would like to include them in the table discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| All that being said, this is the plan I present to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| We have a short timeline, but I think we can accomplish it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| and open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| The goal would be to walk away with a final plan tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| so that that could be submitted next week to the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| First, I want to thank you for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| This is quite detailed and very adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| It looks perfect to me, except for I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| I notice you've used a lot of Wednesdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| and I'm sure some of those will contradict with school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| I know we're using the small assembly room probably for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| but my question is do we have CTV capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| because this is a process that needs to be completely open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| My understanding is that it may not be live streamed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| but we do have recording capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Then I guess I'll just go down to this is Knox County business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| and I'm just going to question why we would have someone from the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| or the city on here to bring who you know their influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| and desires would be catered more towards the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| and the city of Knoxville than Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| That's up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| These are just recommendations from planning from the last time we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| I have the same thought process as Commissioner Smith in the last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| Is there any way we can combine the meeting on the 25th with our meeting on the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| and do our reorg meeting and then do this meeting afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I will be gone that week in particular, and this way we're here for one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| because the reorg meeting only takes like 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| and then we can do this afterwards and knock it all out in one sitting instead of two sittings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| Let me just pull up the calendar while we're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| So it would be the following Wednesday, the 1st, which would be our reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| Instead of the 25th, correct, Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| We would just need toâ€”the only reason to keep it away from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| is we would have to choose leadership two different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| And just sake of time, that only gives usâ€”I mean, it still gives us three weeks before the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| I was just going to say, I'm wondering if we need to move the August 25th meeting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| because I think there's a lot of commissioners that already realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| where some of the lines are going to need to be drawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| and I think we just need to have a meeting to see if that makes sense as a preliminaryâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| We need the data first. That's part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| It's a week after the data, so they're 10 days after they get the first data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| We can't evenâ€”we have to get the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| and then they have to process it into the system for us to actually use the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| It's going to take them a minute to just upload it and process it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| The comptroller's hired a third-party contractor to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| So it's going to take everybody a minute, I believe, to get everything right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| and then we've got to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| But I'm just trying to take two days and merge them into one since that first part is pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| And I also understand, I mean, regardless of the first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| every meeting is not going toâ€”I mean, everybody'sâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| it may be hard to go down that rabbit hole, too, of making sure every meeting, every personâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| it's really impossible to do, but let's take that under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Let's go over the October and November meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| I guess to the law director, does this have to come before commission as a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6765)|
| 1:52:52| Ordinance on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| So it looks like that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| We're going to have to have a special call meeting in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| and then our regular meeting for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| So our regular meeting is going to be the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| so what we would probably do is a special call meeting on the 8th before our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6791)|
| 1:53:19| and then do our first reading then and then do our second reading on the 15th at the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| So I just didn't put those in stone because I was kind of waiting until the calendar got a littleâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| If we have a special call meeting, we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| There's no requirement, like a 30-day waiting period or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| So tentatively it will be November 8th and November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| For October, we've got meetings on the number three, four, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Why so many meetings in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| Well, we've got three, basically two andâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| they recommended six meetings, six actual voting meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| based upon the last time we did redistricting and they went back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| and I have all the minutes and looked atâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| there were some things that were very fast and there were some things that were very contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| and they just left a buffer of saying don't get too fast because there's going to be something that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| So they recommended laying out six total meetings, five that vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| and one that you get your kind of house in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| There's not necessarily that we'll have six meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| We may wrap it up in five meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| We may wrap it up in two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| If we wrap it up sooner, trust me, we will put it on the calendar sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| because the election commission is the single biggest factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| I promise you if Chris Davis is missing half of his hair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| he will miss it all by the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| because the idea of not only moving our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| but then each election precinct and then recalculating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| For instance, just oneâ€”you have a massive voting precinct in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| which has grown a lot and will likely shrink in District 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| but that one district now, you're going to have toâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| because of the numbers and the way the voting rights work and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| you're going to have to maybe break it up into one voting block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| will have to be three voting blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| That's how we get a lot of these like 62N and 62S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| So the alignment of those on top of everything else is a little maddening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| But, yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| If we'd wrap it up sooner, I'd love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| So I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Oh, Mr. Schoonmaker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Yes, and on the bottom of page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| maybe what we need to do is change that to just participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| And I agree with Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| that there's no reason to have representatives from the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| or the city of Knoxville in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| And, of course, the law director's always going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Drew's always going to be here because it's a commission-related meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| So, you know, and obviously we're going to need some assistance from Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| So I would just say participants or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| just so that it's not something where people think that they're part of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| Okay, so what I'll do is I'll change that to non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| I'll just leave the planning department and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| because those are two really vital pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| and then take everyone else off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| We will just invite, if it's okay with this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| we would just simply make notice to the city and Farragut that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| well, it'll be a public notice, but I think as a courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| we would send it out to lots of people saying, hey, we're having these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| This is a big process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| Just out of curiosity, do you think that we might need somebody from KGIS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| They're on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Terry Gahula is going to bring the KGIS people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| He just didn't know the particular person, so he's going to coordinate them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Mr. Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Are you sure that starting at 530 of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| there will be public forum for all these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| It depends on how we want to set up the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| We will set up this public website that has constant ability for people to provide feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| and then we can review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| They will be listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Everyone will see everyone else's comments, and we will have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| I think in our very first organization meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| we have to determine do we want to set a public forum in each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| or do we want to just continue to get feedback from our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| and through that online portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| We can decide that when we do our organization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| The only question on the floor right now is the first meeting on the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| there was a recommendation by Commissioner Ward to move that to the same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| as our reorganization as a commission, which would be September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| That is also just one week behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| Our commission reorganization is currently scheduled for 4 o'clock on the 1st, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| Woo!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| That's a bad omen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| 4 o'clock on the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Thumbs up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Thumbs down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| To move it back one week, we would have our reorganization at 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| and then we would go right into our redistricting at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| How long is the first meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| That first meeting probably will take about an hour and a half, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| Everybody should expect a two-hour block, for sure, every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| and then if we end early, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| I think it makes perfect sense to do it after reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| Reorganization is only going to take a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| Yeah, it usually takes less than an hour because you go through all the committees and structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| So we will change this original meeting from the 25th at 530 to the 1st at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7130)|
| 1:58:58| Are there any other changes before I submit to the comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| I'll outline the November 8th and November 15th meeting dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| and then we'll take off city, Farragut, and commission office from the non-voting participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7146)|
| 1:59:14| I'll see if I can get a name for KGISs to add them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| Any other changes to the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| I'll submit this, and I will send you a copy of the final letter and submission to the comptroller next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| with all the attached copies and keep everybody in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| If you go to this website on the front, it does give you an opportunity to kind of play around and look through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| It's pretty interesting, but again, preliminary data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| It does not mean it's real data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Just because it's out there does not mean that's what it's going to finally look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| but they wanted to kind of give us a preview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Again, Chairman, I want to thank you for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| A lot of work. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Is there any further business or announcements for this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| Seeing none, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210621?start=7209)|
