| 0:00:55| Saunders. Let's pray. God, we thank you that we live in a country that we can express our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=55)|
| 0:01:05| feelings and our ideas and we can share that and I pray today as we come that you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| give us great insight and great wisdom for the city for it is now and what it always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=71)|
| 0:01:19| will be. I pray for that for each of these council members and the mayor and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| and as we come together and talk about this recode and the future of what it may hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=84)|
| 0:01:33| I pray for civility and wisdom and the best product out of it. We pray in your name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=93)|
| 0:01:44| Please face the flag and render the salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=104)|

| 0:01:56| with liberty and justice for all. Please call the roll, Mr. Johnson. Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=116)|
| 0:02:05| Here. Councilman McKenzie. Here. Councilman Ryder. Here. Councilman Roberto. Here. Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| Mayor Saunders. Here. Councilman Singh-Perez. Here. Councilman Stair. Here. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| Here. Councilman Welch. Here. Thank you. We do have a quorum. So let's read the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| into the record. 4A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| the percentage of the lot which may be occupied, the sizes of yards, courts and other spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| the density of population and the uses of buildings, structures and land for trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| industry, residence, recreation, public activities and other purposes and for such purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| to divide the municipality into districts or zones of such number, shape and areas as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| it may determine and regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| uses of buildings and structures and uses of land to prescribe penalty for the violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| of its provisions and to provide for its enforcement and to repeal Ordinance No. 3369, known and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| cited as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, and to all amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| thereto, all as a product of the public process known as Recode Knoxville, all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Okay, Council, before we get started, I want to give a little overview, context for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| day. So this is the second special called meeting of City Council for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| considering a new Knoxville Zoning Ordinance which has been prepared and publicly vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| through a process known as Recode Knoxville. I want to right away address a misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| that some folks might have and may have been misreported in the media, not all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| but I think I saw it somewhere. Council will not vote today on a final amended document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| As I stated at the beginning of the meeting on May 14th, after, this is what I said, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| the May 30th special called meeting, which is today, it will likely be July before another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| Council meeting can be scheduled based on known schedule conflicts. This will give Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and the public more time to review the amended ordinance and whichever option for the official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| zoning map is chosen, if we even get to that, which at this point we won't, prior to resuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Council deliberations. So there's no expectation that Council will complete all their deliberations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| today, even if we get through all 18 articles, there likely will be more questions for Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| to come back or more amendments that they want us to propose like we're going to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| today. In addition, as we mentioned last time, there is a zoning map that still needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| considered. So, back to my notes. So following this meeting today, Council will not deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| recode during the month of June. However, the zoning document as amended so far after today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| will be online for public review. And by the way, what has been amended so far is online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| already. However, during the month of June, I am requesting that each Council member meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| individually with our Planning Executive Director, Gerald Green, to review draft for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| map and to compare it to a map that is being prepared that is equivalent to the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| map. This will help Council members determine the best option for approving a zoning map at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| later Council meeting. If you sit down individually, you can explain very thoroughly what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| equivalent map looks like, what requests have been made that ended up through the various versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| to draft for. And that way, that will help you all when we come back together to talk about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| zoning map and where you are each individually with that and then as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| So then, I want everybody to be aware of these dates. The next possible dates for a discussion at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=352)|
| 0:06:02| every code at a Council meeting are the following. July 16th and 30th, those are both regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=362)|
| 0:06:11| scheduled Council meetings which would begin at 6 o'clock. Those are Tuesday evenings at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| If after June and after the review, if Council is ready to begin to talk or if there are amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| that are requested tonight, the first time we would have a chance to then bring back those suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| new amendments would be July 16th. We would put that on the agenda for July 16th and most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| we would go through our regular schedule first and then the last item on the agenda would be to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| with whatever is on the agenda dealing with recode. So July 16th and 30th are potential dates. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| know yet whether something will be on there. It depends on how this proceeds tonight and Council's review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| of the zoning map. But I want you to know because it's possible. Also, August 5th and August 12th, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| would be the next two possible meetings for Council. Those are special called meetings. Those are both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| Mondays and those meetings would start at 3 p.m. So August 5th and 12th, both Mondays starting at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| like the meeting today, special called meetings. So those are four meetings that you need to have on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| calendar in case and then ample notice will be given if there's something about recode on any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| meetings, okay? So also I want you to know that in an abundance of caution, we have requested Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=459)|
| 0:07:49| Finnbar-Saunders, I know some Council members brought this up, our legal counsel, we've all talked, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| requested that planning put draft five of the recode as it has been amended, as it was amended on May 14th and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| as it may be amended tonight to put it on the Knoxville and Knox County Planning Commission agenda for June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| for their consideration. There's been some question on whether some of the amendments, whether they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| further review. Our legal counsel doesn't think they do, but in an abundance of caution, we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| that it's on June 13th to put it back on. So we have hit the deadline and for the request, it will be on the June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| 13th agenda. And that will be just the text of the zoning ordinance, not the zoning map, but the text, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=509)|
| 0:08:38| Gerald? Would be the text as amended through these two meetings. And we will ask the Planning Commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=518)|
| 0:08:47| review that. Okay, any questions from Council on that, what I just said on all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| Okay, so I want to remind everybody that to pass this new zoning ordinance, Council must vote for it on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=534)|
| 0:09:03| separate readings. So again, the vote on the first reading will not happen until sometime after June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| potentially in July or in August, when Council has completed its thorough review of the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| and made whatever amendments they determine appropriate. Remember, they also have to approve a zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| before the zoning ordinance, or which I call the text, right, there's the ordinance text and there's the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| They both have to be approved before either one of them becomes effective. So here's where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| Again, the ordinance before us is draft five, draft five, which I think many of you have a copy of and have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| and been working off of. On May 14th, we began deliberating, Council began deliberating on the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=583)|
| 0:09:52| ordinance. There are 18 articles, and on May 14th, we got most of the way through article nine, so almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| halfway through. At that meeting, Council voted on and passed some amendments, and that is now online as in green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| font, as changes to draft five. They also asked city staff to come back with recommendations for potential other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=606)|
| 0:10:20| amendments, based on questions they raised or were raised in the audience. Again, if you want to see those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| amendments that have already been approved by Council, or the questions that they raised, look on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| It's online at recodenoxville.com on draft five as amended. It's under the news and updates section on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| page. So today, we're going to continue that process, and we've got some handouts, which I'll explain in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| So once again, we expect this will be a protracted meeting. So we are ordering pizza for Council, and this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| Vice Mayor Finbar Saunders is paying for the pizza for the public. So pizza for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Pizza for the people will be paid for by Vice Mayor Finbar Saunders, so we can all get some nourishment at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=665)|
| 0:11:14| and keep on going as necessary. Okay? Thank you, Vice Mayor. It helps my retirement savings that you pick up this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=674)|
| 0:11:23| Okay, now look at the handouts, please. We have some extra for the public. If you still need one, please put your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| Who's passing them out? Dory, down front here, some more people. Okay, the handouts include four documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=689)|
| 0:11:51| So the first one is in blue, so I'll be referring to the blue sheets. That is the handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| Those are Council-initiated revisions to Draft 5. As we went through this document last time, these are the things that either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=718)|
| 0:12:08| Council voted on or they asked us to decide to bring back further amendments or recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| So we'll start with this, because we want to go back and finish up what we started at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| And as a part of that, there are two attachments, which we will get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| One is Attachment 1 on the staff-proposed RN-4 District Table, and the other is Attachment 2, which has to do with the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| what do we call that, the functional family restrictions and residential areas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| And so we will get to those as we go through the blue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Once we finish the blue sheet, then we will continue on the white sheet, which is what we passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| This is landscape this time, rather than portrait style, but this is what you got last time that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| So we will continue to go through the rest of the document with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Everybody understand? And I'll kind of walk us through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| We'll begin on the blue sheet with Number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| And some of these won't take long to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Number 1, Article 1, Purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| There was a request that we consider adding one-year plan to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| And this is on page 1-1. We have to keep clear on each page and each article number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| So on page 1-1, the 1.2b, when it was talking about the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| the purpose of the code is to promote orderly development of the city and implement the adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| Knoxville-Knox County General Plan and then list the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| And y'all asked that we include adopted one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| I just need a motion. Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Passes unanimously. Okay, also on page 1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| there was discussion under 1.3, Applicability, Letter A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| Territorial Application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| There was some extended discussion about what this actually applies to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| So law, planning, staff, we reviewed that, and this is what we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| I don't know, Charles, if you want to say anything to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| but basically that this code applies to all land uses and structures which are in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| and which are used for a private or non-governmental purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| So whether it's a public building or a private building, there was some question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| if a public building is used for a private purpose, does it apply to it? And this would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| Motion to approve. Second. Okay, and again, if there's any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| from the audience, please make yourself known if you have any questions with this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| All right, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| Okay, that has been amended. Number three, page 1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| On 1.4b2, which is under Existing Uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| 2 and b4, we needed to clarify that it was subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| still subject to, BZA, Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| And if you read the proposal, it includes including review by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=941)|
| 0:15:49| Move for approval. Second. Any discussion on that? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| Any opposed? That passes unanimously. Now on to page 2 on the blue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| On page 2-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| under the Rules of Interpretation, staff was directed to look into inserting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| the introductory language from the current code to this Article 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| And you can, what staff says here is, upon review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| staff determined that the introductory language of Article 2 of the current zoning code is mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| incorporated with the exception of the definition for person. Therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| staff proposes adding the following to Article 2.3 definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| which will likely be on page 2-19. We say likely because once all the amendments come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| some of the pages might change, right? So the definition of person, an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, and includes a firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| partnership, or corporation, its or their successors, or assigns, or the agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| of any of the aforesaid. It's a layperson. That's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| Okay. This is a definition of person, according to our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Any discussion from council or the community? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| Move to approve. Second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Okay. Also on page 2-1, for 2.1D and 2.1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| this has to do with the must, shall, will, the rules of interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| You asked us to consider the terminology. The recommendation is to leave as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| here, on this page, but update Article 17, which is the nonconformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| to reflect mandatory requirements with the use of shall rather than may or must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| So keep this page the same, but if you move to 17-1, in your document, page 17-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| we'll go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Christina, do you want to explain that in more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| what's there and what we're proposing to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Yes. As far as Article 17 goes, you'll see in red the word shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| or shall be stricken in the current version that we have in front of us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| What we were proposing was to go ahead and add the shalls and shallbes back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| That's what matches the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and hopefully that would fix the ambiguity with the nonconformity section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Okay. So I actually would say the amendment would be the use of shall or shall be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| We need to add that in there, too. Use of shall or shall be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Okay. I think this was raised by the public in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Does everyone have no problems with that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| So any questions from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| Any opposed? That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Next is page 2-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| This is new with definitions for animal care facilities and small animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| The request was to strike the last we already did that. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| So we already did that, and so you see here on the document it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| We added or kennels, right? So we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| Number 7 on the blue page 2. This is on page 2-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| If you want me to go any slower, let me know. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| 2-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| Definitions of grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| If you look on 2-12 under grade, it says defined in section 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| So there was a request that we view and consider defining grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| Who wants to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Yeah, we just defined grade so that when we reference it when measuring for building height, we have clear direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| So what we would do is strike where it currently says defined in section 2.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| and instead we would add grade, a reference plane representing the average of finished ground level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| adjoining the building at all exterior walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| Any discussion from anyone on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Any opposed? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Again, are you on for the next one or for that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Page 2-14, number 8, even though it's already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| This is number 8, 2-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Even though it's already been voted on, could we ask for an amendment to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| I am comfortable with you speaking to that if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| First of all, let me ‑‑ I was going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Stay right there, and I just left me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Go ahead. Go ahead, Carlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| And I have to say, very impressed with the work putting all of this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| We thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Made it a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| This specific item ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Just to brag about staff, a lot of this was done over the holiday, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| so thank you for acknowledging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| This has to do with the definition of kennel, and an amendment was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| and I think it partially fixes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Our request is that the definition in the existing zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| which comports with one in the animal code, be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| It was important that they got kept in the definition as opposed to boarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| but I think to make it even clearer, the definition used in the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| says kennel, any lot or premises on which five or more dogs more than six months of age are kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| as opposed to what's in there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| a facility where five or more dogs or cats over the age of six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| are kept for overnight or short‑term stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| And the reason this is important is this is how we enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| if somebody has 20 dogs on their residential lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| we can say it can't be more than five or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| Boarding or kept for long or short stays is less clear than just the existing definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1393)|
| 0:23:22| which any lot or premises on which five or more dogs more than six months of age are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| So we would just ask that we use the existing definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| which has worked well and has been enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Mr. Green, do you know what the rationale was on this definition change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| Unfortunately, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| This definition came from the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| and I think they used a definition that's used commonly in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| and did not have the history, and I'm sorry that I don't have the history here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| either having not been here when kennels were a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And just from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| I see no problem with using the definition in the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Counsel, what's your preference here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| In addition to amend to the existing definition, which reads, I'm reading it from online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| any lot or premises on which five or more dogs more than six months of age are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1456)|
| 0:24:25| Would you like to amend that, and I'll ask Ms. Malone also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| The current definition says dogs and or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Do we want to include cats in the definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| Oh, Lord, we're not going to get into a dogs and a cats thing, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| We could be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I was talking about the definition that's in the zoning code at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Mr. Green is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| The definition in the animal code involves cats but not fish, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| So I'm happy with just dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Cats tend to be quieter and cause less of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| So the motion would have it only apply to dogs, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| As the current code does, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I'm fine with just dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I don't want to get into cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| I think the dogs is the important part, so I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| We have learned when you talk about dogs and cats, this is when you get the most response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Counselwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I think we should include cats just if there is an issue going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| We can address it more clearly, whether it's dogs or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| So then what would you would just add and or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Substitute motion to include cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| So would someone state what that motion would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Do you mind, since you have it up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Read it, but add the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| But add the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| You guys, that's funny that you would ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Thank you, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Any lot or premises on which five or more dogs or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| Someone suggested to add pigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| I'm not going to name any names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Any lot or premises on which five or more dogs and or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Then are we adding the dogs and the cats together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| So you can have two cats and three dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| I'm looking at our enforcement arm, our zoning administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I'm not trying to be sarcastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| What would you like it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| How do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Well, now it's only dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| If we say and or cats and dogs, dogs or cats, is that an addition problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| If it's and or, it's cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I need to be or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| It's and or, it's cumulative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| So or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Any lot or premises on which five or more dogs or cats more than six months of age are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1624)|
| 0:27:13| So the substitute motion is or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Dogs or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| So I'm trying to pull up the animal control ordinance to see if it is, I mean, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| like if we're going to make a change to our zoning ordinance and it's going to open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| a big debate if we change it to include cats and it doesn't reflect the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| So let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Can I suggest one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| That would put it out of whack then with our animal ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Let me read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| But maybe we wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Wait until later and you proceed separately on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Chapter five, animals, kennel has a definition there because they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| It means any person that keeps, harbors or maintains five or more animals over the age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| of six months excluding fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Someone just said that a moment ago, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| I mean, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I couldn't figure out where she got fish from, but now I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I would recommend just leaving it the way we have it with the dogs and we can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1706)|
| 0:28:37| and address cats at another time if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| And that way it keeps it in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Would you withdraw your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Yes, I withdraw the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Is everybody with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| So the motion now is to approve it as stated in the animal ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| In the, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Well, which is in the current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| But it does not match that in the chapter five animal code, which is the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1744)|
| 0:29:14| part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Am I confused now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| We can look at that change, too, and try to make sure that they're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| So now we're going to keep the current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| So the motion is keep current zoning code and then, Christine, if you'd make a note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| do we need to look at how, you already have it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| She's fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| So everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Keeping the current and we'll look at whether there are any other conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| It's an amendment of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Next one, number nine on the blue sheet, page 2-21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1797)|
| 0:30:07| Definitions, public safety facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| So one member of the community asked for some clarity on what would be allowed in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| safety facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Upon review, staff suggests that no changes be made to this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Public safety facilities that are non-governmental and or for profit must go through the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| process that's identified in Article 16.4 to get permission for the special use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| residential areas, which is on the matrix, Table 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| So the suggestion is to consider any concerns about this when we're looking at Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1850)|
| 0:31:02| Is council in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| I make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I don't have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Well, we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I think we'll just without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| There's no motion to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| So if there's no objection, then we will keep the current definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| And when we get to the matrix, can discuss any concerns if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| The point is, is that if it's a for profit or non-governmental, it does have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| There is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I think the concern from the public was how do we know what's going in or what's the review process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1891)|
| 0:31:40| And so if it's a for profit or non-governmental, if it's public, then it's going to go through a review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| through our budgeting and our approval of contracts and RFPs and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Okay, so council agrees to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Number 10, Article 2, page 2-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1917)|
| 0:32:08| This has to do with building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Rules of measurement for building height under Article 2.4E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Building height, we request the staff to review and define grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| And the response to council is if grade is defined in Number 7 of this list, which we passed, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| then this proposed change becomes unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| No motion needed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Right, nothing needed unless there's any discussion or objection to staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| Okay, so now we move on to Number 11 on the blue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| That's page, jumping up to 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1976)|
| 0:33:07| Okay, so this is under uses, 4.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| It said consider creating a chart to help visualize 4.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| And so if you look at Amendment 1, which is this extra handout, the one pager like this, Amendment 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2002)|
| 0:33:36| this is the chart you see, the B1 and 2, that is on page, replicating page 4-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| So we would insert in there this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2023)|
| 0:33:54| Give everyone a chance to look at it if you have any questions of Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2034)|
| 0:34:04| I like it, but I asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Well, that makes it even more perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| If you ask for it and you like it, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Well, it was hard to understand with all the 1, 2, A, B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Yeah, I think this helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Any questions from council or from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| So, okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Attachment 1 has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| All right, next we have, same page, 4-2, uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| There was a request to revise the section to add current codes language on residential occupancy standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| and functional families as Article 4.2 subparts C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| This is where you go to your next attachment, attachment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| but this is the current language about residential occupancy standards and functional families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| except the red and the blue, the strikeouts and the additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| are based on the names of the new zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2124)|
| 0:35:41| So since we took action on this, do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| We want to vote because you asked us to bring back the attachments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| so if you would actually vote, you voted to have us do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| but now let's vote on the actual attachment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Please, we know who you are, but state your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Jennifer Roach, 609 Wise Garber Road, representing Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Sorry, I wasn't at the last meeting when this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I was happy to see this being taken out of recode because the language, in our view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| kind of goes back, harkens back to a time when this maybe was appropriate in zoning codes but is not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2173)|
| 0:36:21| I have a question, I guess, for legal in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| In just the regular occupancy limits we have, I think, which are two per bedroom plus two more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| are related persons and unrelated persons limited in the same way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| If unrelated persons are limited more than related persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| this has a discriminatory effect in our view and with case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| And I think removing this from recode is important when we're talking about trends in housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| multi-generational, whether they're related or not, adding in accessory dwelling units, cohabitation, co-housing for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| A lot of people who have housing instability, this is something that sort of adds to that housing instability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2226)|
| 0:37:16| if they're concerned about getting flagged for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So I guess I just have the suggestion that we just go to the basic occupancy limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| rather than talking about the people in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| And I guess I have that question for legal as to whether they think it limits unrelated persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| more than related persons, and I apologize for the complicated nature of the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| At least it's early in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Thank you, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| We don't have occupancy limits, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| We have, this was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| There's regulations for overcrowding in the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| It's section 404.5, which is, it gets complicated, so I'll probably lose you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| That's in the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Is that in the building code, Mr. Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| It's in the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| It basically has minimum square footage requirements per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2295)|
| 0:38:26| Do you want me to get into the details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| So for a minimum area in square feet for one to two occupants, a living room of 120 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| no requirement for a dining room, and then bedrooms have a minimum square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| which I believe is 70 square feet per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| So it's pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| It doesn't discriminate between related and unrelated persons, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| It's all about overcrowding for meeting the minimum health, safety, and welfare of the occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| I thought the concern was including some type of provision related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| whether it's related or unrelated persons, which probably is almost unenforceable anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| That's what we have currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Is that what the concern is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I left out, I'm sorry, one critical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| In the short-term rental ordinance, it has a limitation of two people per bedroom plus two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| So in a three-bedroom house, you could have eight people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| And it would suggest mirroring that for consistency across different ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| and to keep it based on the amenities of the dwelling and not the status of the people inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| That would be our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I don't really see that as a legal issue as much as a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| So I really would defer to our enforcement folks as to how they feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2393)|
| 0:40:10| I think that would be easier to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| I don't think any of it is truly enforceable, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| Which is what Lee stated last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Which is the conversation we had at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| So whether we go and ask if they're related or not or how many people are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2428)|
| 0:40:38| we're not going to sit there at night and count people coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| I think it makes sense to base it on the number of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| but I'm happy to enforce whatever gets inserted to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2451)|
| 0:41:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Just for the record, I was opposed to it last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and I think I'm still opposed to it just for what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It's not enforceable and it's not enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| and I don't think you really want to put it in there just for the sake of having it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| and applying it or forcing or suggesting that somebody come to that standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| when we know we can't enforce it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| I'm opposed to having it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I think it's better left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| And I think that's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And the reason that I said last time, and it really hasn't changed much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| is that what you do is you establish an expectation among the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| who want to abide by appropriate standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| who want to determine what is safe and what is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| And so this contains a standard for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| but truly to be able to enforce it is almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| So the question is, do you want to put that standard in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| knowing that it's not a particularly enforceable standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| But there are pieces of it that number of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| There are cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| There are cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| That is enforceable, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| It's the number of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| So that is something you can measure and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| well, you all have too many cars and that is an out product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| of how many people are living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| So there's other ways to enforce the same thing that it is enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| and I think that was the point we tried to make last time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| You have 10 people living there and you've got 10 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| They've got too many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| They're all parked all over the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| So that is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| That's certainly conceivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| They may all have scooters rather than cars, and you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| That's all there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I echo, I think, what Councilman Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I'll just add to that that when I read this definition, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| it borderlines on sort of discrimination to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| We're defining what a functional family is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and that doesn't feel like something from a policy perspective that I would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| I think sticking with the impacts on the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| whether it's traffic, noise, vehicular parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| those are the things that need to be regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| and not whether or not people are related to each other living in the same home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| So I will not support this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| And just to remind everyone, this was a tight vote last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| Five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| It passed five to four to add it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Councilwoman Sincerez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Very similar to what Councilwoman Welch was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| that this is going inside people's home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| and telling them who they can live with, who they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| and it is bordering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Not bordering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I feel it is discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| If we're looking at zoning laws, the reason that they mainly exist is nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| So once again, what is going outside of the home, the parking situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| or anything that is actually affecting the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| I believe it's more important to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| So the reason that we've, and I'm not saying that I, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| I'm not even going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| The reason that this came up is because there were several neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| that it brought them peace of mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| even though they knew that the enforcement part was very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and it's not so much about telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| And no one ever goes into anybody's home and checks to see who's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| But from an enforcement perspective, I have a couple of questions for legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Number one, we can't tell anybody how many cars they can and can't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I can have 50 cars if I want, correct, as long as I get them all tagged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| Depending on where you keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So let me give you a specific example with a definition of a functional family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| definition of a family, as how it failed in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| We had a residence that had 40 people every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| and people in the neighborhood would call and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| there's 40 people there, and there were 20 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And they were stacked three deep, five across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| I mean, I don't know, maybe that's 15, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| The whole backyard was just a menagerie of cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| orderly put in, that was how they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| They were all off street parking, off the alley, and codes went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| That was back when Anita Cash was with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I know we had many conversations, people in my neighborhood, not me specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| but I just know that that was a place where it was an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| and they were like, yeah, we can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| So there was nothing to be done about the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| And when we talk about enforcing noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| that's a whole other conversation that's not part of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but I have yet to find any noise complaints that end up being really enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| I'm not pushing for definition of a family to address those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| I'm just saying let's not sit here and say that we can enforce noise complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| and multitudes of car complaints, because that's not the experience I've had in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| So if we're going to find a way to address those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| then let's find a way to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| But we haven't hit that nail on the head either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| And I'm not studied on that for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| You know, I understand this discussion that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I think it's an important discussion for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| I think where we end up with is that these serve as guidelines, as kind of guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| so that in an instance, and I can ask maybe Peter this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| if you don't have residential occupancy standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| and someone is renting a home and they have 15 people living there, 10 people living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| they're not related at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| They're not one economic unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Maybe they're college kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and they have boyfriends and girlfriends of their own, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| So now you have even more people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| You're going to end up with a lot of cars, I would imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| maybe not parked in the front yard where you could do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| Maybe they're in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Maybe they're up and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| If you don't have these guidelines, which probably 90% of people would follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| when they call you and say, I've got this problem, can you do anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2850)|
| 0:47:41| Your question is whether I can do something about it with the absence of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Without these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Without the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| You would have to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| there's nothing I can do unless they're parking on the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| or they're making so much noise that you can file a noise complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| So that's why these are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| The definition is very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| It encompasses a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| It's not intended to be discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Otherwise, the law director wouldn't recommend that we leave it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| It's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Neighborhoods in the 2nd District had all said they wanted to see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| including West Hills, Forest Heights, and Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| I think if we talk to other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| they're probably going to also want to see this included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So I see this as kind of a guardrail to make sure we have some standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| that we can attempt to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I tend to be in agreement with Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| maybe with some minor revisions in C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| since we are defining the functional family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| or just maybe even wordsmithing this a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| because I, too, have received some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| and complaints in residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| where there were multiple people living in a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| There was one gentleman and about eight women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| who were probably working for that gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| and the residence felt very powerless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Also, they knew that this was a three-bedroom home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| that had about ten people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| And so I know that in the past, it's been about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| you guys may have received some complaints about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| but hands literally were tied to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| other than just warnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| because you guys couldn't differentiate who was related and who wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| But I think it came down to the occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| the overcrowding piece from a safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| So I do feel like something needs to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| I don't know if it needs to be as stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| as defining a functional family and relatives, those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| but I do think that we need to have some type of stopgap listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| Otherwise, I think we will see residences with two-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| and three-bedrooms that could potentially have 15 or more people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| This is a troubling issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| There's no question, but what Councilman Roberto is referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| is really a guideline and not an ordinance or not a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| Guidelines are pretty tough to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| They're strong suggestions in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| I know we have the same thing on the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| that those are guidelines, but people by and large comply with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| If we can catch this thing as a guideline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| I don't know what the legal consequence might be or if it's worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| I mean, what we're trying to do here, I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| but if it's not enforceable, it's kind of problematic in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| Well, you don't really adopt guidelines within a code of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| because a code of ordinances is this is what you can do and what you can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| If you try to adopt guidelines in there, it gets very confusing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| to the people who are trying to understand what they can and they can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| and they say this is what's required and this is what's a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| I think that makes it very difficult for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| So my preference would be to have this is what the rule is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| or this is not what the rule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| And then if you want to publish some kind of guidelines somewhere outside of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| then okay, to the extent that that's helpful, then go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| But if you're going to put it in the code, it's either going to be a rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| maybe a difficult to enforce rule, but nevertheless a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| So there's the rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| How do you enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| And Peter's already indicated it's very difficult and sometimes not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3114)|
| 0:52:03| So I'm going to comment and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| but I do think we have to have something that encompasses this subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| in this ordinance in the recode to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| Councilwoman Sinkpress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Going back a few conversations ago, Mr. Ahrens, with this in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| and the same scenario that Councilman Roberto was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| would there be anything that you could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| So we do receive complaints on too many people living in a dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| and we send a codes inspector out there to ask the occupant, the tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| how many people are living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And then based on the zoning district, they calculate what the maximum is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| If the answer that they receive is over the maximum, they say that's too many by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| You can have a maximum of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| And we'll be back in two weeks to verify that your occupant load has been reduced to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3179)|
| 0:53:07| So they'll go back out in two weeks and ask the same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and they generally get a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| And so what I hear is that it's not enforceable with this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3195)|
| 0:53:24| So basically the enforcement is letting people know what the guardrails are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| if they didn't know already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| So it sounds like with this definition or without, it's not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| For us to put guardrails that indicate one group of people's values and not another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| I don't think is our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I think something very broad, but this gets pretty specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I actually liked a lot of the guidelines that Ms. Roach was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| Councilman Wallace, and then Mr. Belba.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Which is more in line with just a number of people per bedroom plus something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| So instead of taking out all the children by blood, marriage, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| I mean two people per bedroom plus two additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| I mean something very simple that you can measure that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| when the whole, you know, blood, children and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| I think it's where it gets complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I think if you want to simplify it and go two per bedroom plus two additional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| then you can count heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| It's still hard to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| I don't know if it is enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Council, I'd like to make a suggestion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| I've not picked up, I could be wrong and tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| that was a five to four vote last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| No votes have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| This is something that's been in for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Some really good issues have been raised, I think, by Ms. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Is it Roach or Rocha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| This is something we could put on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Like if we keep what's there, because it's been there for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| and then that could be added to the list for further discussion for post-recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| Is there a way that it, do we want this to stay the way it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| knowing all of the problems with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| or is there a better way to be able to address neighbors' concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| This is something that took a long time when it got passed the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| and it's going to, I don't think we can start rewriting it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| So my suggestion is that we leave the vote as is, add it to the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| and that's another discussion working with the realtors and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| the neighborhood groups that we can then have a more full discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| not in the midst of all the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I just was going to say we are not the only city that has tried to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| And I know this was a long discussion when it got passed the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| because one of my previous neighbors was on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| It was also discussed at length after it was passed multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| on Neighborhood Advisory Council when I was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| So just really quickly to wrap the discussion on that, Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| we already have occupancy standards based on square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| but we don't employ them in lieu of this because we have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| This is much more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| than the overcrowding regulations of the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| If I might, Nick Delladope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Chris would drive Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| It seems to me that just having it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| obviously you're not going to abuse this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| gives you an opportunity to deal with the really bad situations that get out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| And even if Peter Ahrens and his group can't go out and count heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| or do blood tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| and the neighbor or someone in the neighborhood is really being just overwhelmed by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| they can file a nuisance lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| and this will be one standard that they could point to to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| look, they're not even in accord with what the normal occupancy standards are for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| That's some evidence that it's a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| And I notice in the second section under D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| the criteria puts the burden on the householders to prove that they meet the test or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| So keeping it just as one more tool in the arsenal, I don't think it's going to be abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| but it gives you a chance to reinforce sanity when things get out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| So I hear no motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| The existing vote, well, actually, I need a what I do need then is a motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| we're going to leave it as is for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| knowing that council could request staff and planning to look at the concerns as raised by the realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| Ms. Roach, and all the different pros and cons, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| Ma'am, do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| I could just for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Sorry, Sherry Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I live at 332 Forestall Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| I have to agree with the real estate lady that this is potentially very discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| I have to agree with the people that said we already have the density guidelines and that square footage per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Of course, no neighborhood wants the situations that the two council ladies have described there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| But at the same time, with the changing nature of family units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| and people having to team up to afford living space in ways that just weren't considered a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3524)|
| 0:58:53| you could have a situation where two single mothers with two small children wanted to rent a three-bedroom home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3533)|
| 0:59:02| They would not be able to under these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| And I can think of several more instances that should be allowed that would not be by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| So I would agree with just taking this out, go with what you have currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| instead of trying to nail it down to specific numbers because that would be discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Well, this is what we have currently is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| And so it's been in place for years, and it has amounted to basically peace of mind for some people and no enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3564)|
| 0:59:35| The fact that it's been in place for years means that it's probably outdated and needs to be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| The density, the square footage per person, would be my preferred way of determining whether it's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| So what I think we've said is that we will leave in what's been in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| but we've added that to the list, which is actually page 6 on the blue sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| some of the things to bring up after recode is completed to consider whether there's a better way to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| addressing all the different concerns that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| It's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| I think what we need is, and I agree with the approach you suggested, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| I think this can be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I think we're going to spend all day here if we continue to work on trying to make some amendments to the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| You need a motion to make the change so that the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| I need a motion to approve attachment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Right, which basically all it's doing is changing the residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| which are no longer in the current draft of recode, to update those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| So I will make that motion to go ahead and approve attachment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| So when the first time we vote on this, whenever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| then we'll have an opportunity to make amendments, and we can address it then if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| You can amend this as many times as you want until you get to the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I'm recommending that we wait and finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| But we'll have an opportunity if we want to address it then at a real vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| Well, these are all real votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| These just aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| These are all real votes, but it's just not the final votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| So until it's passed, it can always be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| After it's passed, it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| After it's passed, it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Until first and second reading, it can be amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| So until it's passed on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| No, we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| I'm just trying to move the process forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| So we have a motion and a second to approve attachment 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| which is exactly the same wording as in the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| except it updates the name of the residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| The same floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Who are the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Raise your hand if you are no on attachment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| I'm a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Raise it high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| How high do you want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| One, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| And adding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| So it passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| Who was the third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| That's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Now we're moving on in the blue pages on page 4, number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| Page 4-8 in your recode book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3761)|
| 1:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| This is pocket neighborhood design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| We already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Y'all approved that change, and it shows there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| Number 14 on the blue sheet, page 5-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3788)|
| 1:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Page 5-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| You requested staff to revise language to clarify that C-G is intended primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| for indoor commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| So that is at 5.1A2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| And the staff suggestion is to insert as the last sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| this zone is intended primarily for indoor commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| with limited exceptions per special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Number 15 on the blue sheet, page 5-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3839)|
| 1:04:13| 5.4B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| This has to do with design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| We already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Y'all already voted to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Does not apply to C-N and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Moving on to number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Number 16 is page 6-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| Page 6-2, design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Page 6-2, 6.4A, design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| Clarify language to make it clear that this applies to all buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| including non-conforming buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| If you remember, we had a gentleman from the public who was raising concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| about there was confusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And so we took a stab at it, if you look at the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| to add at 6.4A, subject to Article 17 of this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| which is what the non-conformities is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| But really, in reviewing this, staff doesn't really recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| Following the meeting, staff met with the gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| and we think there's more clarity on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| and in some ways we just think it will confuse it more to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| subject to Article 17 of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| So basically we're not recommending any change to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3939)|
| 1:05:54| No change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| No change, no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Is everybody comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| No change, no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| Are we at number 17 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| We're now at number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Okay, number 17 is page 8-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3970)|
| 1:06:27| Okay, this is the Hillside Protection Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| We ask staff to prepare amendment which applies the HP overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| to districts under 8.9.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=3999)|
| 1:06:50| And so staff proposal is as follows for Article 8.9.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4010)|
| 1:06:59| The regulations of the HP overlay district apply to all lots in all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| You voted to ask us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| Now you have to vote if you accept the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| This is to clarify, to actually make the amendment that it covers all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| I continue to support applying the Hillside Protection in all districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| but I think there are some questions that have come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| that have made me think we need to look at this a little bit more deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I think we're getting a little late in the meeting at this point, too, last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| So a couple of things to note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and the first is that when you look at the density and land disturbance limitations table 8-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| it really is written for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| And so something would have to be clarified in order for, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| for staff to be able to interpret for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| For commercial, the only part of this that would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| would be the maximum land disturbance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| The reason the residential density limits doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| is that the residential density in the commercial and mixed-use districts is unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| There's no limitation on the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Twenty-five percent of infinity is still infinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| So I think we can make that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| It may be good to clarify in the language so that members of the public understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| And I may be preempting Ms. Roach, but in speaking with actually Tim Hill yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| and who had talked with Ms. Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| the exempting properties in the hillside protection overlay that have already been graded or disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4125)|
| 1:08:54| because there may be a lot that's in the general area we show as a hillside overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| but that lot has already been developed, disturbed, graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| And if we apply these, it doesn't make sense to apply these standards to a lot that has already been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| and graded and may be ready for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| We'd only hinder the redevelopment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| So I think there are some things we can clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| And I don't know if we can do that here or if it would be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| just to have work with Christina and Peter and bring that back at the meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| That may be a more efficient use of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| That was going to be my other question for clarification is how this would impact redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And it does seem to me that if slopes or ridges have already been impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| it would be a little bit more challenging to apply the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| I think we need to, you know, these questions come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| And I do apologize, but I was on vacation for a week after our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| And in saying that, I didn't have time to, I didn't think about this the whole time I was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| But I also wanted to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Actually, that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| You came back really rested and patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I was smiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| But I also want to thank publicly Peter and Christina for all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| and the mayor for all the work that they did while I was gone at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| It was both rewarding and disturbing to get text messages while I was on vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| letting me know all the stuff that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| But you didn't have to be in the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you, Carly Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| I really appreciate the change that's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| My concern continues to be B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| And maybe I don't understand what a lot of record for single-family dwellings existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| as of the effective date of this code means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| The way I read it, and I could be wrong, is that if you have a 10-acre lot, 20-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4255)|
| 1:11:04| and it's zoned residential and allows a single-family home, it is exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4264)|
| 1:11:14| So, in other words, it's exempt from hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| One could go in and level it and then subdivide into building lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| And if that's the case, it's not much protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| Now, if I'm reading that wrong, please tell me and put me out of my misery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| But seriously, I don't know what it means other than a lot that allows of any size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4296)|
| 1:11:45| that allows single-family residential dwelling is exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| And that can be 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| That could be 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| It could be 50 by 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| At 50 by 100, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| But if it's 20 acres and it's under hillside overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| I think the smart money is go level the lot and then subdivide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| So, please tell me I'm wrong or fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| That is one of the items that staff will work to clarify as we move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| Mr. Hill, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| I was just going to share, in our practices, the lot of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| we often one lot to make a lot of record in order to build a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| So, that lot of record at the time, then, once you subdivide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| those are new lots of record, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| You could not subdivide the 20 acres and put 20 homes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| because it was that one lot of record as it stands with one house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| And I think what Ms. Malone was talking about was the grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| not the subdivision and the construction of homes, but the grading that could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| And that is one thing we need to address as we clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| But they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| I think there was some suggestion that you could put 20 homes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| but you could not do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| You could grade it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| No, it's about grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| It's not about the number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Then you could put the number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| And after you graded it, you could put the 20 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Yeah, after you graded it, it's no longer something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| So, those are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| And, again, trying to keep this efficient and moving along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| this could take a while, I think, in discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| But I think we know, the staff, we know the gist of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and we'll work with Ms. Roach, Mr. Hill, Ms. Malone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| and members of the council, as you desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| to come up with some standards that are clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| and work to implement the Hillside Merge Stop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| And I do want to say that if that's what you all choose for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| then because we won't be meeting in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| there will be time for staff to draft some recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| maybe some options, depending how it comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| and circulate it pretty early so you all can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| members of the public can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| and then you'll have a chance to discuss it with the various sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| and with the individually, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| and with Mr. Green or with our law department or Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| So maybe when we come back, we will have it thoroughly vetted more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| so that we can come to some conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| Do you want to speak, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Yeah, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I was going to get into a history lesson, but I'll forego that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Ms. Malone and I have a similar concern on number two there with the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| What our position is is to take this back to where it was introduced in draft two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| which I believe is its current state in how it's currently enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| That would take care of that issue in B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| Draft two is where it was first introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| It wasn't in the tech report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| It wasn't in any of the stated purposes of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| It wasn't in the first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| We, like Councilman Welch said, have a lot of unanswered questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| about how it would impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| It may be very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| It may be a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| But I think codifying it in its current state in draft two is what we would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| We'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I think we do need to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| I've slept since draft two, and I can't remember what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| We'll look at it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Well, if we're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I voted against this last time because I thought it was, while long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I do agree that all property should be under the hillside and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| But if we change the rules midstream, and that's kind of what it felt like we were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| I didn't think that was fair to the developers that might have already made plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| based on what was in place, or at least their understanding, whether it was correct or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| Amy, do you want to, Ms. Noller, do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Yeah, I think you can see the complexity as we get in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| And please know the chamber does not support mountaintop removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| or, you know, shaving, cutting trees down everywhere possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| And when this went through a very long public process eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| one of the concerns we see here is when you talk about a 15 and 25 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| I mean Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| You're talking about redevelopment of Bearden Hill, a lot of districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| And I think then you see what Vice Mayor Saunders says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| The real complexity here and the lack of clarity and the lack of predictability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| that property owners are going to see when they see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I have, we haven't talked about the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| but there is a significant amount of property that will be under the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| I think we need to really consider what that does to the tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| if all that commercial property becomes kind of undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| and what these regulations mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| So I would really like to consider, again, going back to draft two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| and adding the commercial, again, maybe make that a stakeholder advisory committee question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| that we really consider the ramifications of what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| not only for property owner rights, but also for the city's tax base going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| So if we're going to study this and we will have another shot at it when we vote on the final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| so if we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Just one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Davis Overton, 1321 Forest Brook Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Also, when you do study this and look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| if you will look at the actual map and where the hillside protection outlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| because I know that we've redeveloped some property in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| and it is not accurate as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| so I'd hate to have to succumb to a hillside protection overlay that doesn't exist right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| just because the map isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I mean, I think we've brought up, again, some really good points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| Looking at this, I think if you look at B1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| if you were to strike what's there now and replace it with structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| and land disturbances existing as of the effective date of this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| that would encapsulate all of the redevelopment that we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| So I think there is some language we can probably put in here that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| I'm all for having it studied some more and making sure we don't have a negative impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| but I think there probably is some language we can use here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| that would get us the end result we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Well, I think existing structures is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and should the structure burn, can you replace it if it's in the hillside slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| I think that's another concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I mean, I spoke against it last time, and I think it's too far-reaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and it's too quick to all of a sudden put all the commercial districts in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| There's a great advantage in residential for hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| The last time we saw it played out, I mentioned it last time, was on Hollywood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| where they got to use the density of the property under the slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| on further down on the flat part of that, and it was a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| I think what you'd have to do is come up with what that benefit would be in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| What would be the benefit if they do not leave the part that would be protected by hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| leave it alone, then what would be the density coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| There's a real correlation in multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| It's an easy way to do it, or in single family, doing that in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| I don't know how you would come to that, but I think that's something we'd have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| It's existing structures that are destroyed for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| and then what happens to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Can it be rebuilt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Can it be added onto without disturbing the slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| So there's a lot to consider there, and I think it's far too reaching to pass it just as changing some words out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| I'm going to ask a really rudimentary question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| What is the benefit of slope protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| Some of the benefits are reduced erosion or reduced stormwater runoff, stability of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| I live in an area where I'm not far away in a county because of a disturbance of a steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| There was a mudslide after heavy rains and loss of lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| We're fortunate here that no major disaster has occurred because of a slope disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| but there are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| There's the lesser, some consider a lesser impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| the aesthetic impact of slope disturbance and grading of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| In fact, Tuesday evening's county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Councilman or Commissioner Busler talked about some developments in his area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| where because of disturbance of slopes and steeply graded areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| there were impacts of runoff and mudslides, small mudslides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| So there are a number of impacts that can be avoided through reduced disturbance of steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| And I know with the recent flood, there were so many landslides and so many trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and these protections help that not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Okay, so the direction to staff is to go back and review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| We still have a vote that at this point stands at seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| It applies to all districts, but it's sort of like the doubles in the details now to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| and look at some of these things, lots of record, is there a loophole, lack of predictability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| how much property is affected, those types of things, all these different comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| So staff will be working with that, and it's something that once we get some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| maybe some options or some recommendations, we will share with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| I just want to add in case no one has considered this, back in my delivery driver days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| I encountered some lots that had been developed from a larger lot into, say, a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| And rather than doing a lot of grading, they ended up with driveways that were so short and steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| that if it was an icy surface in the wintertime, the car would just slide down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| It was extremely difficult to walk up the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| So I'm just wondering if instead of the alternatives of grading or not doing anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| if some things like terracing could be considered to add levels to it because that would reduce erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| maybe get these developers to look at things in a different way than how they've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Number 18 has already been approved dealing with, I think this was your eagle eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| We need to take a brief break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| You need to save the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| So let her save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| I'm going to start talking, but we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| I mean, let's, you all can start looking at number 19, which we've already voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| That's the animal care facility, the five instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| I don't see any discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| The next one we voted on, number 20, which is on page five of the blue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| We made the restroom facilities not permanent for the food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| So start looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| We will have to look for a vote on number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| That's a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| Number 21, page 9-26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5076)|
| 1:24:53| Tell me when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Still saving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| This is a minor typo, but if you look at page 9-26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| planning commission is listed twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| It's a minor typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5112)|
| 1:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| So do you see that on 9-26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| And also, we are going to ask you later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| there are several places in this document where planning commission is duplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| So I'd like a motion that would prove us to strike anywhere where planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Motion to strike planning commission wherever it appears twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| Minor, but we said we will make no changes to this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| That is not approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| We're just trying to be straight up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| We will strike the typos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Do you need a motion to approve number 21 here on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| That's what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Oh, but we did it for the whole document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Yeah, we did it because I've got another one I was going to ask you to do on the white sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| And I think that in that number eight, we flip-flopped the order of the sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| I jumped ahead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| This is actually, this isn't really about the duplication of planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| but we did make that vote already, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Christina, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| The other vote I need, thank you, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| is you wanted us to clarify 9.3FF8, the sentence application submittal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5198)|
| 1:26:52| Am I looking at the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| We just wanted to flip the sentences to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| an application must be filed with the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| on forms provided for that purpose, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| In addition to the required application information, the application must include the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| That's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| That's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| So now, page 9-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5244)|
| 1:27:33| Temporary use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Correct the typo in H5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| That's at the very top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| We wanted to add sales to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| a portion of a parking area may be used for temporary outdoor sales, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| Permanent display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Permanent outdoor display structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| We had outdoor in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| I think it's just, oh, it is on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| Did you mean to say outdoor permanent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| May be used for temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| We have it pulled up on the computer screen up here with the change in green that was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| but not voted on from last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| What we wrote here included, we added an extra outdoor permanent display structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| I tell you, no matter how many times you and how many eyes look at this, there's always something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| The blue sheet has an extra outdoor in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Permanent outdoor display structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I don't think that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| We need to take that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| That's just a typo on the blue sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| On our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| So this is what we are voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| It would be a motion to say a portion of a parking area may be used for temporary outdoor sales, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| Permanent display structures are prohibited in parking areas, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| And then the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Now we're on 9-31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| And I want to say, once we get, I want to call for a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| We've been sitting here for an hour and a half, and I think everyone might want to stretch, use the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| So do you want to go ahead and do this 9-31 now, or do you want to take the break first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| We'll finish this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| 9-31, the temporary use standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| So Councilmembers McKenzie and Roberto began discussing temporary outdoor events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| But Councilwoman Ryder suggested for this to be discussed at the next meeting because of the importance of the topic, because of the late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| So we agreed to table it to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| So maybe it is after the restroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Since it is a further discussion, without objection, let's take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| If everyone would have a seat, we'll get started again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5415)|
| 1:30:43| Let's go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5443)|
| 1:30:54| Is that where we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5457)|
| 1:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5468)|
| 1:31:29| Please take their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5492)|
| 1:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| So, again, we are on page, we're on the blue sheet, page 6 of the blue sheet, top of the page number 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5515)|
| 1:32:07| and we're talking about temporary use standards for temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| And I wanted to ask, I guess this was, my notes say that there was some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5532)|
| 1:32:22| I know, so both Councilman Roberto and Councilwoman McKenzie, as we said, were talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5542)|
| 1:32:29| I think, Councilman Roberto, you talked about a cap on the number of extensions and how long they could be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| That was part of your question on temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| I think we had already made some changes to the time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| Those are represented on page 931, where it's number four, time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| The part that I was talking about in both temporary outdoor entertainment and temporary outdoor sales was to change the language to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5576)|
| 1:33:09| Let's see if I can find my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| So we'll just look at temporary outdoor sales first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| It would be temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Wait a minute, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| This is on page 931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| At the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| 9-31 at the top where it says H, temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Are we all on the same page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| It would read temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and on the site in place of a place of worship or educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5619)|
| 1:33:59| The same change would occur in outdoor sales and outdoor entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| When we're talking about the temporary outdoor sales, we're not talking about a garage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| If you go to the definitions on page 2, flip to the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5649)|
| 1:34:29| 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5670)|
| 1:34:39| Temporary outdoor sales may include temporary structures where goods are sold, such as consignment auctions, arts and crafts fairs, flea markets, rummage sales, temporary vehicle sales, and holiday sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5679)|
| 1:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| That's on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| 2-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| We have some restrictions on garage sales, but what we're contemplating here is the house next door basically having a rummage sale where they're selling things that are not their own property, not what you would typically see in a garage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5698)|
| 1:35:14| So having these changes for temporary outdoor sales and also in temporary outdoor entertainment, I think it preserves the integrity of what people expect in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5714)|
| 1:35:30| So you're Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Councilman Roberto, I didn't hear you mention registered neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| I do think it's important to – that was an addition to make sure that registered neighborhood associations could participate in temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5741)|
| 1:35:50| Did you intentionally exclude that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| The reason for that is that there are some changes going on in the Office of Neighborhoods right now, which will have more requirements on what a neighborhood association is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5753)|
| 1:36:08| Right now, it would be relatively simple to call yourself a neighborhood organization, and maybe you aren't necessarily the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5768)|
| 1:36:19| So if you leave that in there, it really makes it so that I think we lose any kind of control over what might happen in the house next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5779)|
| 1:36:30| I don't think anyone really wants to have a flea market next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| At least in my discussions with neighborhood folks, I haven't heard anyone saying they thought that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| I'm all for the neighborhood association being able to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I just don't know where – we may not be there yet where we can put that language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| We do have registered neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| I don't know if there's anyone from neighborhoods that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| We do have registered neighborhood associations, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| As long as they're registered, then they're going to be approved by the Office of Neighborhoods, so that should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| So if someone just miscellaneously came up and said, hey, I represent this neighborhood, but I'm not registered to the Office of Neighborhoods, then they would be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5825)|
| 1:37:16| They would not be able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| You're recommending that it include registered neighborhood associations for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| We do have a process, and it may – I would assume it will continue to evolve over time, but we do have a process for registering neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5847)|
| 1:37:37| They're listed in a neighborhood directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Right, but isn't the point of your amendment is to make it at the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| So I guess the neighborhood association would have to have a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| In this one, we're talking about a place of worship or an education facility, and so the main part of the change is to have it occur on the site of the educational facility or the place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5867)|
| 1:37:59| So we're not trying to interfere with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Have them do it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| The issue here is whether or not you want some of these things to be in the house next door to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5882)|
| 1:38:11| I would interpret that to mean the neighborhood is, I guess, a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| You're talking about places, a place of worship, an educational facility, or a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| That's what I would interpret that as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Well, I mean, I think we could make that change to make it sound like it's a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| It's a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| It's a place, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| If they have a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| A place in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I mean, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| I wouldn't have a problem with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| If they have a place, a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| A clubhouse or –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| What if the only thing they have is a city park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| That's not a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| That's not a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| They'd be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| That's another talk permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| This is only in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I'm just going to clarify that we all know we're talking about this is not garage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| This is like pumpkin sales or, I guess, lemonade sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| What if the neighborhood wanted to raise money by having a plant sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| A plant sale is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| There's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| I don't mind having it restricted to a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| I just want to make sure that neighborhoods have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5964)|
| 1:39:32| And I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I think it's too open-ended right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| And so if we can restrict it to the site, then I think that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| If you have a clubhouse, if you have some, you know, a gazebo or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5981)|
| 1:39:50| Do registered neighborhood associations have facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Oakwood, Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| A few of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Some do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| So why don't we make that change to say, or registered neighborhood associations facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=5999)|
| 1:40:12| It just says, it's not talking about where they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| It's talking about who's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Well, we would add, and on the site of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| I thought we were, I thought you were suggesting strike the words associated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| You were saying conducted by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| And associated with, I was suggesting to strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| If you look up there on the green on if you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| But I'll look this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Oh, you can see it there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| See it in the green, events conducted by and on the site of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| On the site of, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| This is what he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| The associated with could mean almost anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| So that's, again, a reason to take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| But I don't have an issue with, you know, trying to, if a neighborhood has a site that they can hold this on, then why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| Or if they want to hold it at a place of worship or an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| I'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| Well, we got a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Yeah, let's, Ms. Malone, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| I just want to make clear, you know, neighborhood associations, not-for-profits, I mean, where do you end with the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6073)|
| 1:41:25| And also make clear that outside of the zoning ordinance, as part of the regular city code, you have to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6085)|
| 1:41:38| You're limited to how many times per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| But in any zoning district, whether it's one household or several households, as in the case of a neighborhood, can have garage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6100)|
| 1:41:51| But a garage sale, unlike what's proposed here, which is sale of cars or stuff you buy for the purpose of selling or taking in as consignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6111)|
| 1:42:02| which is what's proposed in the zoning ordinance, garage sales, you can only sell stuff you've acquired during your lifetime and want to get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6122)|
| 1:42:14| And you can have a million neighbors come together and do that as part of a neighborhood garage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| But it's different in that it's your personal property that you are selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| You're not operating more in a business fashion where you're going out and purchasing stuff for the purpose of retail, not for the purpose of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6147)|
| 1:42:39| So I appreciate the amendments that have been proposed, and I think they're appropriate for a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| So I'll just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Okay, so why don't you clarify what your motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| So the motion is to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| I'm just going to start with temporary outdoor sales since that's where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| To amend temporary outdoor sales on page 931H1 to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6177)|
| 1:43:07| temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events associated with, conducted by, and I need to get rid of the associated with, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6187)|
| 1:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and located on the site of a place of worship, educational facility, or a registered neighborhood association's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6203)|
| 1:43:38| So I'll move to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and located on a place of worship, educational facility, or a registered neighborhood association's facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6224)|
| 1:43:59| And located on the site of a place of worship, educational facility, or a registered neighborhood association's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6239)|
| 1:44:13| Did you get that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Andrew, will you just read that for me please, Councilman Roberto, and make sure that that's word for word what you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| I'm going to do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Is it up here? Any better? Bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| Oh, hey, that's bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Alright, so it says temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and located on the site of a place of worship, educational facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6267)|
| 1:44:40| or a registered neighborhood association's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Yeah, that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Okay, discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Any opposed? That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Mayor, do you want to go to the temporary outdoor entertainment because it's basically the same change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Right, that's the page before, page 930, 9-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Yep, G1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| And I guess it should read the same except substitute outdoor entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6318)|
| 1:45:26| Temporary outdoor entertainment in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and located on the site of a place of worship, educational facility, or a registered neighborhood association's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6326)|
| 1:45:56| So she's typing that in. She's got that in. She's fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| Copy and paste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Do you want me to read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Marshall just said, didn't we just do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| Do you want me to read it again as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| One more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Temporary outdoor entertainment in the residential districts is restricted to those events conducted by and located on the site of a place of worship, educational facility, or a registered neighborhood association's facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6377)|
| 1:46:31| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| Okay, let's hear from our Deputy Director of Redevelopment, Anne Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| I'm aware of a neighborhood organization that hosts a concert series in the park, and it's Edgewood Park Neighborhood Association, but it's not their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6397)|
| 1:46:48| It's a city-owned facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Would that impact their ability to conduct that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| I don't think so because we're only talking about residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| And we've tried to map. I'm sorry to interrupt, Councilmember Roberto, but we've tried to map all the parks as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| So it should be open space designation of the park. It would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| But the open space is in the middle of a residential district. It's still the open space designation that applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| And we'll make sure all the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| You can't have it in your backyard, but you can have it at the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| Well, and, you know, I don't know if you want a rock concert next door or a horse show or circus or carnival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| Maybe a rock concert. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Mayor, if I may, there are a couple of – it never ceases to amaze me that every time we read this, we find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6449)|
| 1:47:38| But in G4E – or, yes, G4E and H4E, the current wording is the Administrative Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6458)|
| 1:47:52| upon review of the Temporary Use Permit, may increase these timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| And that should read the Zoning Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| And that's the current provision or method for increasing those timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| And the ARC has not been delegated that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| So that should be the Zoning Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| And then G4D and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| Wait a minute. Hold those, okay? Let's vote on the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Yeah, we'll get to that. Let's just – so as not to confuse the first –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| I'm sorry. I apologize. I thought you had voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| No problem. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Okay, so on the temporary, we're on the Temporary Outdoor Entertainment G1 with the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| Everybody knows what that is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| Okay, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Now, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Yes, and this would be in G4D and H4E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6525)|
| 1:48:54| The wording should be the Zoning Administrator, upon review of the Temporary Use Permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| may increase these timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| So just changing who is responsible on both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Did you get all that, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Any discussion from anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Anything else on those pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Now we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Oh, hey, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| On the end of the blue page on Article VI, I think we discussed this at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Gerald was, Director Green was in agreement, but we were concerned it wasn't going back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6579)|
| 1:49:48| and so, therefore, MPC had not discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| But now, since it is going back to MPC, if we could make that change, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| You want to talk about what that proposal is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| And that proposal was to increase the height, maximum building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| and the Industrial General and IG, General Industrial, and IH, Heavy Industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6603)|
| 1:50:11| maximum building height increase from 50 feet to 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| That seems a reasonable request, especially given the functions of industrial districts now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| and the research activity that's ongoing at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| and our desire to more intensely use land, so going up makes more sense than going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Any discussion from anyone on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| In fact, we had actually talked about that this afternoon, that this might be able to be added in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| so thanks for jumping up because I did not think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| No, this is a motion to allow, on Table 6-1 of Article 6.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6652)|
| 1:51:01| to allow maximum heights for buildings in IG and IH to be 90 feet instead of 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| so we're actually going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| And then it will be part of the amended ordinance that goes to MPC so they can review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6669)|
| 1:51:17| because that was one of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| That was something we didn't want to have to, we wanted to make sure it was properly reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| So you've got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| Everyone's, all of our official scribes have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you, Amy, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| So that's the end of the blue sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| If you look, the items for future discussion, there was still, there was a question that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| post-recode to talk about, is there a need, it was raised by some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| is there a need for another residential neighborhood district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| Also, Councilwoman Ryder asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Number two, we've actually taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| And then the third thing, which I have added, was the functional families occupancy standards issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6722)|
| 1:52:11| Could we not add back the Hillside Ridgetop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| Hillside we're talking about during the break here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| Let me look back on my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| We'll try to address that during June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| June's going to be busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| But you already had your vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Yes, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| I was going to say that, although I was thinking of another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Let's get someone not to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6762)|
| 1:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Anything else on that blue sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Now we are back on the white sheet, the sheet here that says staff initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| Can I bring up something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Let me just get everybody to the right page, though, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| What page are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Well, actually, going back to the industrial districts, the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| So, Gerald, Director Green, could I bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Still being nice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Once it abuts a residential area, we have areas along Baxter, Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| And that, I'll pose this to see if that's a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| If it abuts a residential district, the minimum rear setback is 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| and the minimum side setback is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| So, does that 90 feet, a structure 90 feet tall, 50 feet away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| property line, does that address that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| I just, I'm not sure that I'm prepared at this second to necessarily suggest a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| I just think if it's going to go back to MPC and it's a discussion, those of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| us with the neighborhoods next to these industrial zones that are along Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| and Oakwood-Lincoln Park, the neighborhood folk need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| One thing we may do, something that may be an option, and I'll throw this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| with the commercial districts where there's an increased height, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| requirement that if they're, and I'm paraphrasing now, but if they can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| more than 45 feet tall at the setback, and for every additional two feet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| height, they have to set back an additional foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| So, that could be, maybe here, the maximum height is 50 feet at the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| and for every additional two feet in height, they have to set back an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| additional foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| So, as they get taller, the setback is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| That may be an option that the planning commission can review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| That would be a good discussion for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| But this is the point at which I'm publicly stating that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| representatives in the neighborhoods need to be aware that that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| I'm not opposed to the chamber's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| I just, there's areas where we have the old industrial sites, like Standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Knitting Mill, and other places that abut residential historic areas, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| needs to be vetted and considered before it's finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| I would like to hear from the neighborhood, those neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| representatives and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| But if you look at the table 5.1, there's a provision about structures in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| greater height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| It's page 5.3, table 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| 5-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| 5-3, and table 5.1, it states that the maximum height, for example, in CH2 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6960)|
| 1:56:08| 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| However, structures must set back an additional one foot for every two feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| height over 45 feet from any required setback abutting a residential lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| And that may be an appropriate wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| Okay, so we voted to increase the height, but part of this will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| discussion with the planning commission, so it will have been reviewed and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| can be discussed again on whether there are additional setbacks or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| Mayor, while we're on that table 5.1, I did receive a request from Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| Village Council to look at in the CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| This is again on 5-3, table 5-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| In the CG1, the maximum building height is 45 feet, and they had asked if 70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7019)|
| 1:57:07| feet would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| If I may, I think I copied all the counsel on staff's strong recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| against that, very strong recommendation against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| The justification for that height was that it would allow buildings to be, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| parking to be structured in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| That's a perfect case for going to CG2, which enhances the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| friendliness of that corridor or that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| The reason that Kingston, Pike, and Bearden, the zoning of CG1 was applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| was there was a feeling that they could not bring the building to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| They needed the parking in front, but the building has structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| There's no need for that CG1 designation, so the CG2 designation would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| Our key, I think here you have to understand, our key goal here is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| provide opportunities for greater height in return for better design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| If we give that greater height without that better design, we're undermining our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| goal in allowing the greater height in the CG2 district and trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| these corridors that are more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Why go to CG2 and do a bit better design and be more pedestrian friendly if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| can be designated CG1 and have a 70-foot height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| Ms. English, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| I'm the president of the Bearden Village Council, so I sent you all an email on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| It's something that actually came up in the stakeholder advisory committee a while back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7125)|
| 1:58:53| where one of the members of the advisory committee, who's a developer, was making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| the point that you can't have viable mixed-use development, at least according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| him, unless you've got several stories of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| Otherwise, it's not economically viable to have mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| Well, this brought our attention because if that's the case, then we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| see the CG1 area of the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| This probably applies to other parts of the city as well, but we would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| that be able to be viable mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| Particularly, we would like to have it be able to have structured underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| parking that would help to support the residential mixed-use without having it create a clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| of cars outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| So, I understand the concern of planning staff and the director about having a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7193)|
| 2:00:00| distinction between CG1 and CG2, but I don't think that the, quote, better design of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7200)|
| 2:00:12| is being claimed for CG2 or CG3 is a persuasive reason for not having more elevation possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7212)|
| 2:00:23| within CG1 in order to actually have mixed-use residential commercial buildings in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| And I respectfully disagree with Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| I think the CG2 accomplishes exactly what she says she wants with the mixed-use greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| height, the structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| That was the basis for the development of the CG2 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| So, if there's a property that wants mixed-use development with structured parking, CG2 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| even CG3, depending on the height they want, are the ways to do that and not, again, undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| our goal of trying to craft a sub-district with CG2 and CG3 that creates a more pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| The main difference between CG1, apart from the height distinction, the main difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| is that in CG1, there's now the ability to site the proposed development where you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7275)|
| 2:01:24| basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| It's not required that it be in the build zone of zero to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| Now, that is arguably that being in that build zone is a good design feature for some environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7291)|
| 2:01:40| some streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| But in our area, we're given the network of streets rather than having one main street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| The network of streets would suggest that there are occasions when it is actually better designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| to not have that street forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| So, that's the conundrum here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| And I don't think we should make a general distinction based on the unique characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| of a single lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| If there's a single lot that has a unique characteristic or challenge, that can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| through a variance or other matters rather than taking a broad swipe at what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7339)|
| 2:02:27| is a very good and staff overall thinks is a very good standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Excellent debate on two different sides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| Councilman Rivera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| I was just going to say that if you, you know, we're talking about the maximum building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7359)|
| 2:02:46| You wouldn't have to go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| It's not the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| But if what we were hearing from Ms. English was that there were, you know, maybe there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7370)|
| 2:02:59| was a benefit to having the 70-foot height, you could ask for a variance if you were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Or I think better go to CG2 zoning and if you can't build within the Bill 2 zone, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| there's a challenge with property, request a variance, you know, and that's what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| And, you know, I try to understand the concern, you know, a structured building with structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| parking that doesn't have much land available that wants to be mixed use and therefore should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| be pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| It seems the CG2 is a, we tried to craft the CG2 with that height just for that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| And we're trying to have a balance of a bit better design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| For that better design, you get increased height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| But there would be an option for a rezoning or a variance to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| There are other ways to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| And, again, I don't want to take a broad swipe at something to deal with fairly unique circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| that can be addressed other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| So we are on the, again, on the white pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| It says staff initiated revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| Last meeting we went through 1, 2, and 3, plus all those other ones that we just did on the blue page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| So now we are on page 2 of the white packet, the top, number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7462)|
| 2:04:30| So if you go to page 9-5, actually, so let me, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7470)|
| 2:04:42| Actually, what we should probably do is we've done all of Article 9 except the use matrix, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7482)|
| 2:04:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| So maybe we start with, we have one recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7490)|
| 2:04:59| But do you want to give an overall review of the changes and such like we did last time when we got to a new section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| In the interest of time, I'm going to try to go through these quickly unless there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| Interrupt me if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| In terms of the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| So we're on page 9-2 to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| Turning sideways in your booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| Amusement facility outdoor was added as a special use in the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| This has received some comments from the community, the Bearden Council, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| Other members of the community have expressed concern about the permission of outdoor amusement facilities as a special use in the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7531)|
| 2:05:47| Staff understands those concerns and is willing to accept an amendment to delete outdoor amusement facilities as a special use in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7547)|
| 2:05:58| I'd make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| To delete this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Delete this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| So we had added it, added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| The draft added it because we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| That's a new thing you're adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| You're adding another amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| Mayor, I'd make a motion to remove as a special use amusement facility in the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| So page 9-2 under amusement facility outdoor, the motion is to delete special use under CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7586)|
| 2:06:35| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7601)|

| 2:06:47| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7607)|

| 2:09:05| Everybody follow where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Craft industrial was eliminated as a permitted use in the IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7749)|

| 2:09:19| We didn't see the need to distinguish between craft industrial and just industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| It's all in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| It would all be considered industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| Some kennel was identified as a special use in the CG, CH, CR, and IMU districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7769)|

| 2:10:13| Wait a minute, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| On page 9-5, reception facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| It's about in the top quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| Yeah, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7823)|

| 2:10:57| Again, this is bottom quarter of the page, storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| This would be trying to think of it like Mayo Garden Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7863)|

| 2:11:27| That's a car rental, but it's all interior, and the car is brought to you at an appointed time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| This would allow council member Ryder to walk down to Broadway and rent a car, and they would deliver it to the office at an appointed time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7893)|
| 2:11:45| Where is Summer Place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Summer Place is down on Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| Oh, in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| The Enterprise in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| I didn't know it had a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| We don't have one in the what would be CG, so I can't think of an example of what would be CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7921)|
| 2:12:08| but in the event that they wanted to do that in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| And that's it for the changes to Table 9-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Now, there are on your sheet on number four, on the white packet, there are two recommendations from staff for changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7937)|
| 2:12:28| One, they're both on page 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| Under public safety facility, insert P for permitted use in the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7952)|
| 2:12:43| Do we need a move to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| And then the other one is under the C-R zone, down at storage yard outdoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7977)|
| 2:13:06| to delete P for the storage yard outdoor, to delete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| That's the C-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| Under C-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| As a principle use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Or permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| Did you have a question, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Are we done with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| No, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| Do you want to talk about that, Gerald, just what that recommendation is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| Based on comments from the community to avoid large storage yards, think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8012)|
| 2:13:39| especially what we see more now is heavy equipment rental as a storage yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| or similar type of use in the C-R district, say Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| And I think the comment was specifically to the Turkey Creek area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| but this type of use would not be compatible with the uses typically found in the C-R district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| So we're removing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| So the motion is to delete P in the C-R zone for the storage yard outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| It would be in the C-H and then in the I-G and I-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| I'd make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| Gerald, could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| So what is the zoning in the proposed map for the malls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8066)|
| 2:14:35| C-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| So let me just say, this may be water under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| but I know there was a, like Sunbelt Rental was a prospective tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| I'm not sure if that's not public information or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| but at one point they were considering leasing some of the space on the backside of the East Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| I mean, that's like two-year-old information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| Peter reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| Oh, Peter messed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| They rezoned it to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| Oh, to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| To make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| So that zoning will transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| I believe it's proposed for I-G, which would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| So it wasn't allowed in the zoning, in the SC zoning they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| and so they had to go for a rezone anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| I'm glad we know of the same story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Oh, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| So we have a motion, I think, and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| I'm sorry, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| So is the motion and the second for all of the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| No, this is for the C-R zone deleting P for storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| I'll table my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Aye passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| So Mr. Green, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| So on 9-3 under principle use, we have food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8152)|
| 2:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| So food truck park is not permitted in an office park, an OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| But in 9-6, mobile food units, mobile food vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| Are those the same as food trucks on 9-6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| On page 9-6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Oh, I see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Yeah, mobile food units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| Is that the same as food trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| A food truck park would be, I think, I'm trying to remember the definition without going to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| but it's two or more food trucks that are set there for typically an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8188)|
| 2:16:36| The mobile food unit would be one truck that would be there for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| Fine distinction, but there is a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| And there are certain standards for a food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Some type of restroom facility, common space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| some other provisions in the ordinance for a food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| With a mobile food unit, they only have to meet the standards set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| in other city ordinances governing the mobile food unit or food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| So we would regulate under the mobile food units because they would have to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| it's temporary use in an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| So we would make sure that there were no more than two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| because it sounds like two or more constitutes a food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| So we would regulate that for office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| There's more than just the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| A food truck park is a permanent principal use versus the mobile food units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| where if there are more than one, it's still of a temporary nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| and that's not the primary, the principal use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| So it would be a business that brings in, on a temporary basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| a mobile food unit for some event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| You may have lost me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| So if I'm a food truck owner and there is an office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| and I want to go and set up there because maybe this office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| does not have restaurants and stuff and there's a large number of employees there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| I could get a temporary permit to set my truck up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Okay, during lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| If you comply with the city ordinance for mobile food units, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| And permission of the private property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Councilwoman Sincrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| I want to go back to 9-3, the drug alcohol treatment facility residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| Isn't that, don't we have to allow it into the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| due to the Disability Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| Go ahead, Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| Councilwoman, I think what you're referencing is the Federal Fair Housing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| and the State Human Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Under those sets of laws, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| we can't discriminate against anybody with a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| and a disability is defined in such a way to include addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| But there's nothing that I'm aware of in those sets of laws that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| that they have to be allowed in all areas or in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| So it would just be, you know, as long as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| there's an appropriate zone that's picked for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| that would be sufficient under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| So there is no appropriate, the only place it's permitted is institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| This is something I really have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| I mean, there are addicts already in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| The way they get sober most of the time is through residential treatment places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| So it's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| I know nobody wants it in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| but it is something that as a society we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| And with the way, I mean, we have people dying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| we have people with all kinds of addiction issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| and we say that we want to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| and then we're not giving them any place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| We need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| This is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| So is there, somewhere in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| is there the difference between a drug and alcohol facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| residential versus a halfway house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| And do we have that listed anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Because I don't recall seeing it, but we kind of breezed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| Or how would that be categorized, a halfway house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Is that group home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Yeah, there's group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| 9-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| 2-13 has a definition for group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| Could you read that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| And the halfway house is also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| A group home is a group care facility operated on a for-profit basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| in a residential dwelling for care of persons in need of personal services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| or assistance essential for activities of daily living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| or care of persons in transition or in need of supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| including drug and alcohol rehabilitation, excluding medical detoxification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| Then a halfway house, a residential facility for persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| who have been institutionalized for criminal conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| who either require a group setting to facilitate the transition to society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| or have been ordered to by court as a condition of parole or probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| I think what Councilwoman Singh-Perez was referring to is a group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Because a drug alcohol treatment facility residential is a 24-hour medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| non-medical, and or therapeutic care of persons seeking rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| from a drug and or alcohol addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| It's a licensed care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| So, Councilwoman Singh-Perez, for example, the example that we had last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| that you helped me speak at a group about, it's not a licensed care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| It's a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| And the one thing that I would point out about if you go to the use matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| and look at 9-3, drug alcohol treatment facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| which is defined as a licensed medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| if you note and go down to on page 9-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| health care facilities are not allowed in office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| So there's all kinds of licensed medical facilities that are not allowed in an office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8552)|
| 2:22:40| halfway homes, group homes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| That's not the same type of facility that you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8563)|
| 2:22:50| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| I know that the group homes, the transitional sober homes are trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| we're trying to get them licensed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| So will that make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| No, not based on the definition, whether they're licensed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| The definition doesn't address whether they're licensed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| So that requirement for licensure would not impact whether they're permitted in the residential districts or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8595)|
| 2:23:24| But then wouldn't that fall into the next category of health care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8604)|
| 2:23:33| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| What were you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| It would still be zoning administrator's ultimate call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| but I would think it would still be considered a group home based on the care it provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| Okay, whether it's licensed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| I think the licensing piece would constitute the level of the caregivers being clinical social workers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8630)|
| 2:23:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Can you speak up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| I said I think the licensing piece with the state actually would constitute them having higher levels of providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| that are on site there at the group home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I know I'm getting really picky with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| but there are transitional places where the provider, the homeowner or the provider, has to give out medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| So will that change the definition of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| Does it become medical at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| I wouldn't think it would make it a medical facility if there's not a physician administering, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| But that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| Counselwoman Wright, just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Ms. Malone, I'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| I'm going to turn off my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Okay, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I would just call counsel's attention to the distinctions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8677)|
| 2:24:46| A drug alcohol treatment facility residential is not, these are not the group homes or the transitional facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8686)|
| 2:24:57| The full definition in here in the recode is a licensed care facility that provides 24-hour medical, non-medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8697)|
| 2:25:07| and or therapeutic care for persons seeking rehabilitation from a drug and or alcohol addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| Such facilities include medical detoxification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| We're talking sick people with, you know, these are serious medical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| This includes institutions that are located in one or more buildings on contiguous properties with one administrative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8722)|
| 2:25:29| These are not small facilities that kind of blend in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| And this is proposed in the office zone that, as has been pointed out, does not allow hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| because we're looking for smaller facilities up against the neighboring residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| Group homes and other transitional facilities of all kinds don't, I don't believe, come under that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8749)|
| 2:25:59| And that is one reason why we're asking that it be deleted from the office zone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| which is, again, not the halfway houses or the transitional facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| But this is, you know, these can be fairly large institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| Council members, staff did struggle with where these facilities should be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8775)|
| 2:26:21| So any direction or guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| I think there are two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| There are needed, but they're not wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| And the other one is halfway homes for people getting out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| You know, that's a large part of the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| And we've tried to address the halfway homes and the group homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| The larger facilities are a challenge because of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8804)|
| 2:26:50| But this should allow for the smaller home setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| I mean, it's supposed to be helping you get back into, you know, normal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| So it's a residential setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| And that's the group where the group homes are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| And that's on page 9-4 of the matrix, and it's permitted in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| But then the halfway houses are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| And that is just because it's people who are getting out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| And any direction council wants to give them that would be welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| That one's tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| A lot of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| I mean, we have to have a place for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| I mean, one-third of all black men have been in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| There's a problem with the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| And then we don't give them a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| I'm not preaching at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| I'm preaching at everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| You know, it's a societal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| And that is the large part of the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| It's a large part of why people commit crimes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| So if we want to work on larger society, neighborhoods are going to have to let these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8863)|
| 2:27:50| Any volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| I guess the area that I struggle with is in the office we have a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8877)|
| 2:28:04| Tell me page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| This is page 9-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| We have a special use for drug and alcohol treatment facility residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| And then if you go to the following page on 9-4 in office for health care facility, it was not put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8893)|
| 2:28:21| And I think that's what we were hearing from the public is if you listen to the definition of the residential facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8901)|
| 2:28:31| it sounds like a health care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| Why are we having one allowed in the office and one not as a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8916)|
| 2:28:45| And I take it from the recommendation that I was hearing from the audience was that you wanted to see it deleted from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8925)|
| 2:28:55| I guess that's the ‑‑ I know we've kind of talked a lot about some other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8935)|
| 2:29:02| but if we focus on the office, I'm not sure why we would include one and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| It seems like they're both providing health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| So is a potential solution to just say that the drug alcohol treatment facility residential would be allowed in the same zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8955)|
| 2:29:24| as health care facilities, which is CR, OP, office park, industrial, R&D, and for special use and then permitted in institutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8964)|
| 2:29:40| Is that a potential solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| Since they do sound very similar to a or no, is there a reason not to look at it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| I'll do anything the council directs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| But the request, I mean, but explain what the pushback on, just so everybody understands both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| We're talking about McNabb and facilities like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| The challenge is that the Helen Ross McNabb facility that was recently approved is currently designated office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| and is proposed for office designation, so we would make that a nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| Staff felt that requiring it as special use in that district would enable the existing facility in an office district to continue to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9021)|
| 2:30:32| but any additional one would receive special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| The size could be limited, even the location, so that it's not directly adjacent to residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| although I tend to agree with Councilmember Sincarez that these are people, too, that have got challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9043)|
| 2:30:51| and maybe being adjacent to a residential area would make them, inspire them to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9051)|
| 2:31:00| Makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| I'm just lucky that, given my profession for years, that I'm not in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| But, yeah, this should be addressing all of the population of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| This should be addressing all of the population of Knoxville, not just those of us that are in this room right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| Okay, Councilwoman McKenzie, we're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| I'm not hearing any motions at this point, so we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| I'm still on halfway houses because currently we have it listed as CH, Highway Commercial Zoning Special Permit, on 9-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9091)|
| 2:31:43| So, while I do feel like it is important for these people to be reintroduced into society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9103)|
| 2:31:52| I can also understand communities' apprehension because this is a population of people who are coming out of being incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9112)|
| 2:32:02| However, I would like to see us either change this CH to permanent rather than special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| and also ask Council to consider also CG general commercial and CR regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9128)|
| 2:32:16| And my thought process behind that is that this could actually help cultivate some relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9136)|
| 2:32:24| to be able to look at helping some of these people have opportunities to get reintroduced into the working population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9144)|
| 2:32:33| So, to see halfway houses with a special use permit is very troublesome to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| so I would like to see us have some dialogue around where we're comfortable making this a permanent use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9159)|
| 2:32:46| or either we have special use in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| But I would like for us to walk away with having a permitted use in one of these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9169)|
| 2:32:58| In one of the commercial zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| So, you're saying you want to continue, you want to raise that now but not make a motion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| Well, I want to have some dialogue with my colleagues, and then I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| So, the discussion is making one of those, at least one of those you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=9194)|
