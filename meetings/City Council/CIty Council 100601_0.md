| 0:00:57| after Councillman Brown asked the invocation, if everybody would please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=57)|

| 0:01:57| Councilman Roddy. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Okay, is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Condition, corrections, questions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| All those in favor, aye? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Opposed, no? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Items dealing with the agenda, any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| Items to be added by motion? Mr. Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| I think I jumped the gun. I wanted to suggest a consolidation. Maybe that's a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Okay, let's hang on and I'll come back to you. Yes, sir, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| I should share, there was some discussion at dinner, the public dinner we had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| about the R4 ordinance, which is 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| And I think what we're going to try and do is see if we can talk about that tonight to get a little further along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| We probably are not going to vote on it tonight, but I did want to let everybody know that at the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| I also think that if this meeting goes as long as it potentially might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| somebody might want to jump in at some point and just go ahead and postpone that anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| because we're not going to get to it if the meeting goes particularly long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| But I want to say that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you. Okay, now, Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Yes, we have about six. Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| Items 12C through H are all 202 funding matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| and I ask that we put them on the consent agenda and just deal with them in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| Motion in the second is to put 12C through H on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| All those are dealing with community improvement 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Okay, the motion now is not to approve them, but to put them on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| Okay, all those in favor, aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Those items are now added to the consent agenda, which, unless I see another light, is what we're going to go to next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| Move approval of the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| The consent agenda now includes items 11F through 11J and 12C through 12H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Thank you. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Okay, all those in favor, aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=250)|

| 0:04:57| Okay, a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Just kind of some infrastructure update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Bridge closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| East Hill Avenue, the road kind of passed us down east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| The Bridge Viaduct has been closed from State Street to Hall of Fame Drive from today through June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| They have to mill out the old asphalt and deck repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| But East Hill Avenue from State to Hall of Fame will be closed until June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| The Gay Street Bridge will be closed between 9 and 3 on June 7th and 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| While TDOT conducts its regularly scheduled inspection of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| there will be marked detours in place during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| The intersection of Jackson and Gay, adjoining the Gay Street Viaduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| was closed for at least two weeks for utility construction beginning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| So I just want to let everybody know that it doesn't just seem like we're closing all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Two or three things are being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| But there is some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Pleasant Ridge Road has reopened to two-way traffic for the total length of the project from Merchants to I-640 Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| One-lane closures can still be expected, and motorists should use caution in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| But I know Ms. Palmer joins me in being glad to see that two-lane finally open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Was that ditch that the gentleman was talking about that couldn't get to the bus stop, has that been part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| I don't think it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| I actually spoke with that gentleman this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| And Mr. Johnson from engineering was a tremendous help, and he had a list of about five items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| And Mr. Johnson got back to me within the hour, and I spoke with the gentleman who addressed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| And everything is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Nothing is fixed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Things happen slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| But everything is underway and being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=392)|

| 0:08:50| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I wanted to just fill everybody in the public in on sort of the budget hearings we had last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Council had about 12 hours of hearing from departments about the budget, learned a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| had a lot of, I think, really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Started late this morning talking about some options on the budget, some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| well, I think there was consensus that this is a very good budget, a few ideas for improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| Talked a little bit about a proposal to send some money to the schools that I made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and I think while there was good discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| there clearly was a sense that that's the county's responsibility and we should let them deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| There have been a lot of discussions about pay issues, a lot of ideas talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| We're going to sort of pick up what might seem for folks watching like we're picking this up a little bit in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| We're going to talk about five options, and we sort of understand what those five options are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| because we've been talking about them for a couple hours, but no decisions have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| and we're going to work that through here in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I only have one person sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Seeing no lights, I'm going to call on that person unless somebody on council would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Kevin Fattis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Sorry, Kevin, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Let me, if I can, before Mr. Fattis speaks, I just see board chair from the school, the Board of Education, India Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| I know we talked this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| If you wanted to say anything before we jumped into the meaty part of the budget or whether you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I can wait, but I'd love to say something real quick, and now it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| If you can say something quickly, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| This would probably be appropriate if you'd like to, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| India Kincannon, 941 Eleanor Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| Chair, Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, members of city council, thank you for letting me speak to you briefly this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| I just wanted to come over and thank Mr. Becker for suggesting, you know, proposing the idea of supporting schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| I understand I've spoken to some of you by telephone, and I understand some of your reservations about the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=661)|
| 0:11:11| And I will obviously, you know, we thank you for even considering it because we know you do support schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| But the primary reason I'm here is to first thank you for the $100 million you give to support schools every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| We really appreciate that money, and we put it to good use, and we think it's a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| But we, the Board of Education, also recognize that it's, you give, you dedicate 72% of sales tax revenue to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=692)|
| 0:11:41| and that's a lot more than you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| The state law only requires 50%, and that marginal difference makes a huge difference to the lives of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| So we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| And I also just wanted to say, as a resident, taxpaying resident of the city and of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| I think education is a great investment, and I appreciate your support of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| And also, our doors are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Anytime you all want to visit schools or need information from the school board about your investment, our investment in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=726)|
| 0:12:15| please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| I know Dr. McIntyre is happy to come speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| I'm happy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Other board members are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| We have a lot of good things happening in our schools throughout the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| and we welcome your questions and just wanted to open any, keep our doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Just real quickly, I'd like at some point, we can probably pick this up at dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| talk about some ways to get Ms. Kincannon or Dr. McIntyre in and talk to us a little more about the schools and how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| I know there was a lot of interest today and don't want to lose that important subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| So, but we'll just pick that up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Kevin, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| If you'd give us your name and address first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| My name is Kevin Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I live at 1031 Josepe Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| I want to thank you again for letting me speak, council members, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| We've had in-depth conversations throughout the month or so, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| Of course, I want to approach you all and ask you some of the same stuff that I'm fixing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| I'm just reiterating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| First off, let me thank the firefighters for being here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| I couldn't explain it to them, so I'm glad some of them showed up and got interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| So I appreciate you guys for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| First off, I just ask that we fulfill this third-year Mercer commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| You know, myself, Councilman Becker, Mayor, Finance, Mr. Jim York was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=835)|
| 0:14:06| Larry Martin, great guys, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| But we'd ask that this third year be committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| And part of that reason is some of the discussions we've had with council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| You know, next year, proposing to finish it off next year, you know, as a Mercer three-year plan, next year doesn't sound good either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| I mean, we've got the finance director talking about it could be raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| It could be raining for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| We think the money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We'd like to use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| It's not going to interfere with bond ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| It's a million dollars, $800,000 to a million, depending on the fringe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| I think it's doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And keep in mind, to some of the councilmen and some of the people in the audience, this isn't just for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| This million dollars will cover all the city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| You know, I could get into numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| You guys know the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| A lot of you know the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| As many times as I've been up here, you probably think about them at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| But from 07 to 09, city departments turned in over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| And we talk about being budget conscious and constrained on the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| I feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I feel we've done our part as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| You all have done your part as the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| You know, over since 07 to 09, that's a lot of money that we've turned back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| In 07, we added $11.8 million to the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| In 08, $2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| In 09, $1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| You know, that all adds up, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| That all adds up to the $52 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| You know, we're not asking, we're not being greedy by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| It shouldn't be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| It shouldn't look that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| You know, we want a fair wage in this great city where we live, work, and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| That's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| You know, we're committed to the three-year Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| We were in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| And we please ask that you all do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| I thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| You have been here through thick and thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I actually misspoke there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| I have someone else sign up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Anita Cash has signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| My name is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I live at 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| I'm the president of the general government organization with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| And like Kevin, I've been here for the duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I do want to thank Larry Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| As Larry knows, and I want to tell you all publicly, I have the utmost respect for that man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| And he is a man of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| And I've said before here, he is a great asset to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| And the mayor did a good job when he hired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| My parents taught me two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| You've got to be frugal when you've got to be frugal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| But you're only as good as your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| And some of you, but not all of you, committed three years ago to fund this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| Now, civil service is required to do a salary survey every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| And they did that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| And every year that survey showed that we were further and we were further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and we were further behind than our counterparts of equal size and things throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| But we all thought that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| So we paid an upwards of $250,000 to get a new survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1090)|
| 0:18:18| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Our own survey that we were getting done for almost free showed the exact same thing that we paid that $250,000 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| And we have people who work in the service department who are out here cleaning our streets, picking up brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1108)|
| 0:18:40| picking up leaves, keeping this city clean, keeping our roads clean when it snows or storms, who are barely getting by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1120)|
| 0:18:53| And all I'm asking you is, you original ones that were here and you new ones that were here, be as good as your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Okay, that's all we have signed up to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Just for the record, and I want this on the record, I have not, nor will I receive in my position with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| one red cent from the Mercer study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| So I'm not here for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I want to thank the people for coming to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And I have met personally with Mr. Faddis in the past and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| And they have worked hard to get information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| But at the end of those day and a half of hearings and thinking of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| it seems clear to me that we're blessed right now that we have a budget that has no employees being fired or let go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| that we are giving raises across the board of two and a half percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| that we are putting in a portion of the Mercer study to help the folks that are below the midline in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| And it is the sense of this council during the budget hearings that we intend to push very hard that this Mercer payment be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1201)|
| 0:20:12| completed in the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And we ask you to start planning now to incorporate that because we think that's a fair tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| But at the end of the day, at least from my perspective, and I can only speak for myself in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| I think that the council and the city government needs to be mindful that we are in hard economic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| that there are 190,000 people out there looking to us to be prudent with how we spend our scarce dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| This budget does that in a way that gets essential city services out there, gets pay raises to employees at times when cities are laying off folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1242)|
| 0:20:52| And I just don't see how we can pay this money this year based on the information we've been presented as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| Recognizing that three years ago things might have been different economically projection wise as to where revenue streams might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| and whatnot, and they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| They're downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| And I think we were told that we're looking at revenue stream that looks more like 2004 than 2010 was projected to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| So I think all things said and done, it's important for us to be fiscally prudent and as much as everyone would like to have a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| everyone in this room knows people who are losing their job, losing their house, holding on with their fingertips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| and I don't think we can spend money that we need to have in reserve if something happens to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| So I'm going to ask my council members to vote against increasing the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| but ask them to please sincerely consider that we push very hard that this fulfillment be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| And if need be, take a second look in January to see if the revenue stream is any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| But I think we have to be fiscally prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| I guess I want to acknowledge the truth of what Mr. DellaVolpe says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| that I think there is a real commitment on the administration and on council's part of getting the Mercer pay raise when the money is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| And what we're arguing about is that question of when the money is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| There were a lot of options that were talked about over day five, and I'm going to, at the appropriate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| I'll make a motion to do, I think it's going to be option three, for those of you who can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| And they all sort of are based on an interesting thing that you sort of start talking about, Mr. DellaVolpe, which is prudence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| And having served here with Mayor Haslam for six, seven years now, we have been incredibly prudent in the good years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| We have sat back, and those of us who have been around can remember this, discussions over the years about not putting new employees on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| about not giving raises when times were good, about holding the line on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| We've been prudent through the really good, sunshiny days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| And we have built up a very impressive rainy day fund, 52 million in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| There's additional money in, it seems like, almost every other fund in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| There is money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| And I think we are currently in the worst economic time since the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| It's raining really hard right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| And I think now is the time that we can dip into the rainy day fund and use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Now, the way we're going to do this is a little budget deal to make sure we don't fall into a trap of using non-recurring money to pay recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1402)|
| 0:23:32| But fundamentally, this city has been incredibly prudent for the last seven years, has saved up a big chunk of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| And now I think is a legitimate time to say we are one of the blessed cities in this country that are able to have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| and be able to give the full raise that we've been talking about for our employees for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| So I'm going to be proposing that when the appropriate time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I will go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And what I would like to do on this is the part of the motion is actually going to be, I think, on 9B, which will come up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1449)|
| 0:24:20| And that's going to be a shift in the ratio of the tax rate to move, I'm going to say, four cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| And I hope my math is correct, Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Move four cents of the debt service tax into the general fund, which should, and correct me on this, anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| should increase the general fund by about a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Use that million dollars to fund the third year of the Mercer Pay Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| Should also reduce the debt service fund by a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and will reduce the transfer from debt service to capital by a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| And I'm going to propose that we transfer a million dollars from the general fund reserve into the capital fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1501)|
| 0:25:12| So that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| It's option three that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| And I think that's as clear as I can make that in technical language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| And, Mr. Swanson, please tell me that that's good enough to do what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| I'm afraid I'm not the right person to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I think if the Deputy Mayor and the Deputy Finance Director understand it, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1530)|
| 0:25:39| I think we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| And we'll comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| But I guess what Bob was saying, is the legal, is what he said clear enough language for us to have a vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| Yes, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| And I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Would you like to have a comment from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I guess you weren't asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Of course, we had a long discussion this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| And then we had a sunshine dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| We discussed this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| And we've been taking straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| So I feel like we're doing it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| But I know we have a number of people in the audience and those at home watching on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| So I think it's important that we go through the exercises again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And I asked this question earlier, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| I asked it to Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| But what is your reaction to what Mr. Becker has proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Councilmember Bailey, as we talked earlier, first of all, we think the budget that has been presented to council is a good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| It's a budget that both recognizes the economic environment that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| It also recognizes our obligations to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| As you recall, the priorities were to avoid no layoffs first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| And to fund as much of the two and a half percent for all employees as we could afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| And then, likewise, do as much toward the Mercer incremental as we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| We got almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| And we have funded a good portion of the Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| So we think the approach that we have taken is the best, the most prudent, the best stewardship of our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| We would not like to see council reduce the ratio of the percent of the property tax that goes to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1649)|
| 0:27:39| That was calculated at one time to simply service the debt that we had at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| As the debt has been paid down, obviously, we have more debt service allocation than is required by the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1666)|
| 0:27:55| But that is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| That has helped us build up our debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| That has been a good source of funding for our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| The important thing for council to remember with that, as we fund the capital budget, that allows us to delay or avoid borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1684)|
| 0:28:14| And that is then using those funds, debt service funds, rather than actually paying it to pay down debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| we're actually paying it into the capital fund in order to avoid debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| And debt has an interest expense that we are now avoiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| And even as the timing, we draw some interest off of that debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| So some investment return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| We think that's the good stewardship that you expect of us as an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| So our answer is that we think the budget we proposed is fair, affordable and appropriate for the economic environment we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1721)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Martin, could you tell us that all employees are going to get a two and a half percent pay increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| And then how much of the Mercer plan, in other words, what percentage are we really funding in your present budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| I'm going to ask Mr. York if he'd come to the podium and help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| So just to Councilmember Grieve, the way things work out among the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| 69 percent of our employees will get somewhere between a two and a half and three percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| Now, granted, most of that is clustered around the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| If you look at all employees, almost 98 percent of our employees will get at least two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| The only reason that's not 100 percent is because you have some vacant positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| And then secondly, you have new employees that have been here less than a year and they're getting a pro rata share of the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| So as you can see, most employees are getting the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Twenty one percent of our employees are getting four and a half to five percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| The rest is scattered among those those ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| So as you can see, 69 percent, two and a half to three, 21 percent, four and a half to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| And the fire department makes up a pretty significant percent of that 21 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| I'm going to let Jim speak too, if he would, because it gets a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| When we talk about Mercer, when we initiated the Mercer plan, the Mercer plan actually incorporates the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| You have the two and a half and then what I call a Mercer incremental over and above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| That is applicable to some employees, not all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| So when we talk about implementing the Mercer plan, the two and a half is part of that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Always has been, was talked about at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| And so Jim will talk about given that, then what percent of the whole Mercer plan are we doing by category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| For uniformed police and fire officers, we are funding at minimum 68 to 69 percent, close to 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1861)|
| 0:31:16| For the balance of those uniformed employees, we are funding roughly 80 percent of what we would fund under the Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1876)|
| 0:31:28| Within the fire department, that's, again, more than half of the employees will receive more than the two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| On general government, it's not as easy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| A minimum we are funding at least half of the Mercer, and it depends on where you fall in the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Some people will have 100 percent of Mercer funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Some people are already in excess of where they would be under Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| So, again, at a minimum, they would be receiving at least half of what the difference would be in the Mercer plan with a minimum of two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1914)|
| 0:32:08| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Let me start for a parliamentary question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| Mr. Swanson, can you explain to us, we are only eight people here, so we're an even number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Can you explain what happens if there is a 4-4 vote on a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| If there is a 4-4 vote on a motion, the mayor may elect to break that tie if he chooses to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| If he chooses not to do so, a 4-4 vote ends up with it not passing because you've got to have a majority to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1957)|
| 0:32:46| and so it would be whatever the motion is would be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I just wanted to say there is sort of an answer to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I think we all recognize that this actually is a great budget, that hard work went into getting us where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1976)|
| 0:33:06| that I think I agree with 99.999% of what's here, and I will definitely be supporting the budget whether this amendment passes or fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| But it does say also something of how good a shape we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and I think we all need to be commended for that and know that we are blessed to be in the situation we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=1999)|
| 0:33:28| and I want to thank those of us who have made that happen because it's been hard work over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| But now, again, my sense is we have a rainy day fund and it is raining now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| and it might not stop raining for a while, but we have a very large rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I think we as a council, and I said this this morning in our budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| that I think the first thing in all of our minds is that we cannot underestimate the value of our skilled workforce that serves our citizens every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| We have men and women who put their lives in danger and put their feet on the street every day, and they're incredibly important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Ms. Cash admonished us to be men and women of our words tonight with an agreement that we put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| when we studied the Mercer Plan three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Vice Mayor Becker and Councilmember de la Volpe also spoke about prudence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| and that we have been prudent over the last several years in building up the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| I think now in a time of economic uncertainty is not the time to quit being prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| I think more than ever it's a time to be conservative about our reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| because we don't know what the future holds in terms of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I'd like to offer an amendment to Vice Mayor Becker's motion this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| and that is to fully fund the Mercer Plan this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| but to do that by reducing the amount of the debt service fund that is proposed in the budget to spend on capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| And I think since we don't have line item authority on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| that would be up to the administration to go through and decide which projects are we not going to do this year to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| If that's the priority of this council, then look at the capital projects, the road paving, the bridge repair, the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2118)|
| 0:35:28| all the other things that we do in our city and set some of that aside so that we don't touch the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| Fund the Mercer Plan, but do it prudently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| And that's my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| Before we get a second, Mr. Swanson would like to make a parliamentary comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| I genuinely apologize for this, but we are under Robert's rules of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| except when our rules provide otherwise and our rules don't provide otherwise in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| And I had a lawsuit about this very subject, and so I happen to know what Robert's rules of order says with regard to this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| And it won't stop your asking to do something else, but you may not amend an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| What is on the floor right now is an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| You cannot move to amend a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| What you can do is offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Wrong technical term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we fully fund the Mercer Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and that $800,000 to $1 million be taken out of debt service funds that are currently being allocated toward capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Mr. Swanson, since you're a parliamentary expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| I wish you wouldn't call me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I think you're an expert in that you're the smartest person in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and you're more than five feet away from me, so you're an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| I'm going to take it I'm within the five feet range then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| My preference, I see a lot of value in Ms. Roddy's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| My preference would be to vote on mine first and use hers as a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Were these ordinances or resolutions, I would do something like a motion to rearrange the agenda to put hers behind mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2239)|
| 0:37:29| Is there any similar Robert's Rules of Order that could allow us to vote on mine before hers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| You are currently outmaneuvered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Because the substitute motion takes priority over the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2260)|
| 0:37:48| And so there's not a way to flip it back so that yours gets voted on first at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| other than for Ms. Roddy to withdraw her substitute motion in order to allow your motion to amend to be voted on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2275)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| That's so clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Well, I don't think the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Well, if you have a question, I think the procedure is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| We're going to be voting on Ms. Roddy's substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| We're talking to the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| But I saw Mr. Greaves first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I'm going to go to him and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| With Ms. Roddy's substitute motion, what does that mean in terms of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| You want to take the first crack at it, Larry, and then I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| If I understand what the amendment would be, we would have to reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| You'd be looking to the administration to reduce the amount of the capital budget by a like amount that is now going to be out-of-debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| going to fund the rest of the Mercer plan as opposed to the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| And you're looking to the administration to recommend what changes to the capital budget would be made in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| So if that happens, does that come back to us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| The adopted capital budget would have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Jim, you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I think we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| If this council wanted to pass, they could pass that, but I think we'd have to bring the capital budget back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| If this one passes, we would probably have to bring three sets of ordinances back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2379)|
| 0:39:48| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I missed something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| We would have to bring back the budget ordinance, the tax rate ordinance, and the pay and compensation ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2391)|
| 0:40:01| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| I think either motion, but I'll address Ms. Roddy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| I think it applies to both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| It puts us in the position of pulling a brick out of the wall and finding out what falls and what is not supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| And I know that there are people on this council and in this community that are going to be concerned if we stop building sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| or repairing roads or doing the things we do in the capital budget, building parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| It's certainly something that is going to add pain to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Does that answer the concern of these workers who say, I want my pay and I want it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| Maybe it doesn't in that way, but I think we have to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| You know, we're talking about a contract relationship that says we're going to do a certain thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| And we all sit down in 2006 and 2007 and take a look at the world as a snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| And at the time, we all had an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| I wasn't on this council, but the people involved did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And that was that the funding process would go on, that there would be some growth in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| and that we would be able to afford these things over a three-year horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| And I think we're looking at a situation where we're actually lucky we're not firing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| and laying off people and applying hurt to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| And I think that we have to realize that this is a time for what a lawyer would call an equitable adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| to the relationship or agreement or promise we made to look at the present time that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| And the present time is a very difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And I think that since the cost of living has mostly flattened out, everyone's getting a positive raise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And I think that's something to be really commended and celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And I'm concerned that in our haste to try to get this third-year plan put in all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| as opposed to parceled out, we're going to do damage to things that this community wants to see done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| whether it's the waterfront or some other area to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| And I think we ought to be moving very cautiously because we poked at this budget for a day and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| and a lot of time in between looking at it, and it was a really well-thought-out budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| And I hate to see it come cascading down as we yank bricks out to try to solve a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| So I'm still opposed to it, no matter how we characterize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| We'll go to Councilman Bailey and then to Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Councilman Del Vopi says we poked at it, but really, since we came on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| all of us in the mayor and administration fresh, we really have had quite a debate over compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| And the proposal was made for the Mercer study, or Mercer was chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| and we supported it, and then the plan came and we supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| And I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Unfortunately, we're in tough times and we have a bad economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| so the question is what's the responsible way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| And in the years past, the way that we've discussed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| and the conclusion we've come to is that if you're going to spend money in some area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| then you have to find it in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And I think that's the responsible way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I'm all for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I just don't want to do anything that would adversely affect our city and the way we've managed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2602)|
| 0:43:31| And as it was originally proposed with taking it out of the rainy day fund, I don't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| But this motion is what I support, and if we want to do this, we ought to just find the money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2618)|
| 0:43:48| And so I know, Mayor, that's a tough task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| You guys have worked real hard on this budget, and I respect the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| but I'm willing to look at ways to fund it in some other fashion, some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| You know, Mr. Bailey, we have been over the years very prudent about paying for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| And, you know, we've actually been very prudent in good times, as I said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| It feels like what we have done is built up large reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| And I'm a little worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I'm actually going to vote against Ms. Roddy's proposal because at some level we have, as I'm reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| $52 million in the bank and the general fund, $38 million in the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| We're not going to count capital because that's funky, and then $27 million in some other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| My rough says that's $117 million that we have saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Gratefully over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| We've done a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| It's a rainy day fund, and it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And I've said that a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I think we can afford to take this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Taking this step, pulling a million dollars out of a $117 million fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| leaves us with $116 million, which is still a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| And I think it's, you know, Mr. Dover, you talk about pulling bricks out of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| We're not pulling bricks out of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| We're pulling pebbles out of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| It's very well built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| So I'm not worried about anything collapsing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| And I do wish we could consider them a little differently because I do see some value in doing what Ms. Roddy says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| It's good fiscal management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I don't know if we have to – I don't think we have to be that prudent yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Well, as I said this morning, the couple of things that concern me, in fact, Mr. Dellavopi brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| is that, you know, what kind of message are we sending to our constituency and to the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| As I mentioned this morning, you know, my firm took a 10% pay cut in order not to lay people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| They took two weeks off without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And we're just a small business out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| We have no government to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| We have no rainy day funds or this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| And I think that when you look at this budget, that what they've come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| with giving everyone a 2.5% pay increase plus doing what they can to the Mercer Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| I think that speaks well for what, Mr. Mayor, you and your staff have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| And I think we need to really think hard that not only do we as council people represent the firemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| and the policemen and the service people, and we have a top-notch city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We have a great city that's run well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But I think also that three years ago, you folks probably didn't know what the economy was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| The other thing I'm concerned about is not only what we're saying to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| but we're not sure what's going to happen next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| And if what Mr. Martin and Jim have been telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| our next year's budget is going to be tight and hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| So that if we can go ahead and give everyone a 2.5% pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| and not lay anybody off and still do as much as 68% of the Mercer Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| I think that council has made a real, well, I guess I should say the administration has made a real effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| to meet the obligations because, again, as I say, three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I don't think any of us knew what the economic situation was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| So I find it hard to go ahead and say, well, we're going to find another million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| when people out there, not just people working for the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| but people, small business people, are having a tough time themselves trying to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| And I think we need to take that into consideration that we do need to represent also the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| as well as trying to take care of our city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| I'm going to go to Councilman Pavlis because he hasn't spoken yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| and then I'll come back to Della Volpe and then to Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Well, I would just like to comment on some of those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| I think we, there's no doubt, we have a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| But without the utmost doubt, the reason we have a great city is the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| because, you know, they're the ones every day that put their lives on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| whether you're a uniformed body or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I know after storms, you've got live electrical wires and whatever else, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| out there that non-uniformed people have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| People are running away from a burning building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Our firefighters are running into a burning building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Our police department is running to those bullets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| when everybody else is running away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| So, I think we need to send a message that every business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| every good successful business is run well because they've got good, happy employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| And I think that this, I agree with Vice Mayor Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| that I agree with him that I think Councilwoman Roddy's measure is too harsh at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| And I think we are pulling pebbles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| So, I want to vote against her measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And I do support Vice Mayor Becker's notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Now I'll go to Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I'm going to supersede you because he hasn't spoken yet, but I will come back to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| I have a question, I guess, for Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I've heard two figures on fully funding the MRSA plan through the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Is it 800,000 or is it a million or is there an approximate figure there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| Councilmember Brown, the million dollars would be a comprehensive number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| that would be fully loaded with fringe benefits, everything that would be associated with that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| Well, I think that it is a rainy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| And I don't think that we're going to, the city is going to suffer if this money is taken from the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| And I'm not an economist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| I'm not an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| But I think there are some indications that the economy may be turning the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| And no one can really predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| But I think I'm going to support Mr. Becker's measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Well, I didn't want to quibble about bricks and pebbles, so let me try a different analogy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| We are rowing across a large body of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| We are halfway across and there are storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| And I don't think this is the time to throw away the life preservers because we may have worse conditions coming up yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| and we might need every single dollar of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| So I am still concerned about that question of fiscal prudence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Going beyond that, there is something to be said for looking at the economy around us, guys or ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| however you want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And I turned on the news when I got home after this morning's hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| And New York State and New York City were cutting firemen and police because they couldn't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| There are cities laying off their uniform bodies because they don't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| And I know you're saying, well, we're blessed, we were smart enough to save some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| But this is a very good package under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| And I think that if you couple that with, number one, we will insist that this administration get this piece completed in the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3074)|
| 0:51:26| We can't do it legally in this budget, but we can certainly express the intent of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| And, two, promise to take a second look in January at the midpoint to see if luck would have it that the economy has turned around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3091)|
| 0:51:40| and produced more dollars than we can currently project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| We can take a second look about funding it in midyear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| but I really hope you don't just throw the life preserver out because the big wave might be coming up just beyond the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| And we might have a Nashville tidal wave, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And I think it's important to stay the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Vice Mayor, and then we'll come back to Mr. Grigg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| I'll try and do this briefly, but it's sort of a philosophical statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Mr. Pavlis was talking at dinner about how 11 years ago he and I were fighting over the living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| And it was kind of a little scary to know it was 11 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| I certainly have not aged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| He had hair back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| No, he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| What's interesting is some of the living wage was sort of a theory we always used to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| as long as there are poverty wages, there are going to be poor neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| And part of it is thinking about that we as a city are part of the economy that we all are so worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| And I would say in an economy like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| there is an argument that said it would be really stupid to stop spending some of the money we want to spend to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| if we're going to, say, cut a million dollars out of our paving budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| to go ahead and somehow help the economy by laying off fellows who put asphalt down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| The truth is we are not a big part of the economy, but at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| what happens in a panic is people start thinking, oh, my God, my neighbor can't afford food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| I better not buy as much food because I might not have money for food next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And a panic builds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| In A Wonderful Life, there's that great line, you know, the panics that happen in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| And it would be, I think it's a mistake for us in the economy we've got to pull back on capital expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| when we don't need to, when we have such a large chunk of money in the budget and can afford to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| So I wanted to toss that out and reflect a little bit on where Mr. Pavlis and I were 11 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I think one of the things, you know, we're concentrating so much on this Mercer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| and we're concentrating so much on this $800,000 to a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| I guess one of the questions I have, Mayor, is we have funded the pension plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| And to how much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| About $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| And have you been able to fund the pension plan every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Is there a certain amount of money that has to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Well, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| One of the issues that governments everywhere have in city, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| is how much should you be funding pension plans, most of which are, you know, taking on water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| And we are trying to be very responsible and keep it fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Now, as you all know, there was a presentation made by the pension folks recently to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| There's an argument about exactly what that number would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| We're trying to be honest with the people that come after us to keep it funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Last year we put actually an additional $3 million in to pay down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| We did. I think it was last year. It was either last year or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Is that right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| It was mid-budget that we did it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| Two years ago we put in an additional $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| So we've been funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I think it seems like my first year here we put about $4 million into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| This past year it's about $9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| So it's an increasing number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And I don't know that that's going to turn around any time soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| given the way the plan is funded and the way it's set up, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| So will that continue to increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| If we're betting, I would bet yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| That's our expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| The amount that we're contributing today to keep it actuarially sound, as the mayor said, is $9 million plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| That's a million and a half more than it was this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| And the expectation is that we'll have another incremental amount either equal to that or greater than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| And then, Mr. Mayor, do you have a breakdown or a percentage in terms of what we pay for benefits also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| In terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| For employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| What's the total when you add all the benefits in, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| What's the total addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| You have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I've just forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| The total benefits, and this does not include other compensation, but the total benefits are roughly $24.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3357)|
| 0:56:07| So what you folks have done in your budget is you've given everyone a two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| and a half percent pay increase, you've increased the funding to the pension plan, and you haven't cut benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| Basically, this is rough math, but if you said what if we increased the funding to the pension plan, this is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| this is rough math, but over $1,000 per employee just this year, the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| So that's a rough number of what the increase would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| So, again, you put all those things together, and there has been quite a bit of money that you folks have put into employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| Well, our overall budget is down, but what we're adding to the employees is up about four and a half, five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| Is that number right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Including everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| New pension contracts, two and a half, add everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Our overall budget is down, but what we're paying employees is up five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| And what your intent was is to do as much of the Mercer plan now, but then try to fund the rest of it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| And I'll come back and comment on that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| And for purposes of our understanding, it's fair to say, and I don't know the number, maybe you all can help me with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| isn't about two-thirds of the entire budget for the city going to wages and fringe benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| Sixty-four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Sixty-four percent covers wages and fringe benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Total compensation cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| That counts pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Let me make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I very much appreciate the employees that are here tonight and, quite frankly, the manner in which it's been approached from all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| And it's a very different situation than we had several years ago between council and with employee groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| where I felt like, you know, we weren't handling it in the best, most civil manner possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| And yet, this year, I think there's some honest disagreements, but I couldn't be more appreciative of the way it's approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| We did start out with no layoffs, fund the two-and-a-half, and don't live out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| And to do that, the best we could do was get to funding half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| But just as a reminder, we only did that by eliminating 12 positions and none of the directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| and actually directors plus some of the folks who leveled down, none of those folks are getting any raise at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| And that's the only way we can make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| It's also one of the things, you don't put a budget together for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| You put it together for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| And one of the things we've worked the hardest to do is not have a situation where we did all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| We could do all that this year, but, quite frankly, I think we'd be in a situation sometime sooner where we'd be going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| hmm, well, now if we redid a Mercer study, it would show we're actually ahead of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| And I'm confident if we did a new Mercer study, it would show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| And now we're in a tight position where we're either going to have to not fund the two-and-a-half or have layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| And I really, really, I don't think any of us want to be in that position now or ever to say either no two-and-a-half or no layoffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| because that's a situation, you know, just, like I said, we'll work real hard to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| It is raining, and, Bob, I understand your point, but I think it's going to, if you look at what increases the revenue of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| as we said, sales tax, because most of it goes to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| The only way we grow, the only way we grow revenue, period, is when we get new growth in the city, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| And as we all know, our building permits are at about 20% of what they historically have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| so we're not going to see a lot of new revenue growth for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| And so I think we have to be really cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| I guess my concern, Marilyn, about your proposal is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| We're taking a non-recurring expense to replace a recurring expense with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| And it's not just a recurring, and I know the arguments we've had, it's not just a recurring expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| but it's a recurring expense with a multiplier to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| Because you can just count on it, really, by the time you add all the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| every time you add a dollar in employee wages, it's really at 1.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| because you've got that 3% multiplier every year for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| And I think we really are going to have a situation where, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| you're taking this one-time expense of a capital item, replacing it with a recurring expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| and then I guess my second point would be it's always easy to do that in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| but if we were sitting up here saying, okay, now where is that going to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| It's going to come out of these sidewalk funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| It's going to come out of this, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Everybody would go, oh, I didn't realize that was our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| So I would urge you, before you make a decision, to say, well, exactly what are we trading for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| Because it's easy to take it out of some theoretical capital that, you know, we're not exactly sure what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| So those would be the only words I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Okay, right now the motion on the floor is Ms. Roddy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Marilyn, do you want to repeat it so we can make sure we get it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| The substitute motion is to fully fund the Mercer plan in this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| to do that using tax revenues that are set aside in the debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| to not and to balance the budget to realign the proposed capital improvement plan for 2010-2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3674)|
| 1:01:25| by removing $800,000 to $1 million in capital improvements from the budget to fully fund the Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Councilman, before we discuss, Councilman Bailey has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I was just really under the impression that through whatever process that we would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| where those cuts would come from and as a council would jointly decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| And that's the tough part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| So I know we've got some time restraints, but, you know, I think that's what we'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| We'll go ahead and call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Okay, now we're back, if I'm right on my parliamentary procedures, we're back to Vice Mayor Becker's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| unless somebody stops me and tells me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Can we restate that so we know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Go ahead, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| It is, I'll try and say it in layman's term, it's going to be taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| shifting the tax ratio between debt service fund and general service fund at a million dollars to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3754)|
| 1:02:42| using that to pay the final, the complete third year of the Mercer plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and pulling a million dollars out of the fund balance, the general fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| to fund the capital projects that would have been funded by the debt service million dollars that we're shifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3774)|
| 1:03:06| It funds the full Mercer plan, and it funds the full capital plan, and it moves 1% out of our rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3786)|
| 1:03:18| So you're kind of taking a two-step deal to, I mean, ultimately we're still taking it out of the rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| but you're taking rainy day to capital, capital to, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Yeah, I'm reminded of a phrase that at least lawyers are familiar with and maybe the general public is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| but it seems to me that this is a triumph of form over substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| You're trying to not use dollars that are for non-recurring purposes for a recurring cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| and I know that technically you will be correct, I suppose, in terms of not directly doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| but, you know, there's a saying that you can't do indirectly what you can't do directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| and I think that maybe that's even more confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| but it seems like after all the shifting is done, it elevates form over substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| We are taking money out of the rainy day fund and kind of masking the trail, the audit trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| And I don't mean that in some negative sense that you're trying to do something improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| but I think it still leaves our sense of setting aside money and having a protective shield tampered with in the way that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3861)|
| 1:04:33| York explained when the bonding rating companies look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Are you doing things that fit the checklist of prudent sound management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| or are there iffy questions about that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| So I think we're jeopardizing our bond rating and our future by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I appreciate the gymnastics you went through to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| You know, I think when, as I said, I put forth a substitute motion to try to fund the Mercer Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| and I'm sorry that didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I think, you know, ultimately the fiscal soundness of this city is what allows us to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| and to continue to pay our employees, to continue to offer competitive benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| to continue to offer a great place to work, and to continue to build a city that's a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| And as I've said in past years, I think sound fiscal management needs to be the bedrock of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| and I just can't support taking more money than we're already taking out of the fund balance to move forward this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3939)|
| 1:05:50| And we spoke a little bit in our budget hearings and tonight at our sunshine dinner that there are already funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| in this year's budget that we are already pulling funds out of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| and that is to fund our reserve account, our reserve amount of our general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| It's 1% of our general fund budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| So we're already pulling $1,650,000 out of our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| And, Mr. Martin, if you could help me here, I know in previous years we've spent about $4 million more on capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3975)|
| 1:06:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Than we are spending this year because we had that amount available in general fund dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Previously we had, if you looked at the capital budget for this year, $4.47 million, $4,470,000 came from general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=3993)|
| 1:06:44| Or we had been in effect pay as you go because they were coming out of current revenues that went into the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| When we started building the budget for 2010-11, we took every single general fund dollar out of the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| and then committed it to the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| So we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| And then, as you pointed out, the 1% reserve is through appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| So in terms of where we're looking at next year, if we don't anticipate additional revenue coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| and we do anticipate the same budgetary pressures that we dealt with this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| I think that the motion that we have before us on the floor just digs us into a deeper hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| And I just simply can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Just to add to that, by virtue of those two actions, we have removed that flexibility for future consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| We've already now taken the general fund dollars out of the capital budget, likewise with the reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| So we will be in less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Our challenge in the 2011-12 budget, unless revenues start coming back, is even going to be greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| because we're going to face a lot of the same incremental expense increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| plus we've lost some of our flexibility by virtue of these two actions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| I think this council has heard the phrase that this budget has been cut to the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| And I was willing to support the previous motion where we took the fixed amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| and we just reallocated it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| But I can't support dipping even further into fund balance to dig us into an even deeper hole that we'll face next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| I'm going to go to, okay, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Larry, I just wanted to ask, if we spend money from our savings account, the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| don't we also lose the interest that that grows and it funds other activities and value for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4118)|
| 1:08:47| We try to keep every dollar working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| So, yes, as it is spent, then you would have less income, less interest income or investment income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4129)|
| 1:08:59| Okay. Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Okay. Go ahead, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| You're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Well, it's pretty obvious I'm going to vote in favor of my own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| So I could actually just not vote and the motion fails, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| So I can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| We'll just say the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| Now, Mr. Swanson, parliamentarily, I could not make Ms. Roddy's motion right now because that has been a motion that has failed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| You can make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| No, you were not on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| You're on the losing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Someone who's on the prevailing side could make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Well, I could also let's just try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| You know, we've got comfortable chairs up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| We can hang out for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Now, the idea of this would be we'll look at compromise and see whether any of this helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| The motion I made before was going to move four cents on the tax ratio and a million dollars from debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| and a million dollars out of general fund to fund capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| Let's just cut that in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Let's split the baby and say I'm going to make a motion now that we transfer half a million dollars from debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4230)|
| 1:10:39| into general, change the tax ratio to accomplish that, and pull half a million out of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| So, in effect, we are still funding the full Mercer plan, and we're doing half of it out of capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| and half of it out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Can we just not move to vote on the budget instead of all these things that we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I'll make a motion that we vote on the budget as presented to us from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| What's the prevailing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| I'll make a motion to call the question, which takes priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| And does not permit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| The motion on the floor is actually my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| But if he calls the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| It's a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| A motion to call the question, your motion is not on the floor at the moment, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| Did it get seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| The motion would have to be to call the question on your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| And then, after calling the question on that vote, assuming your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| It sounds like high stakes poker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| First thing, if he's wanting to call the question, he has to call the question on the motion that's currently prevailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| And that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Yeah, I think I'm clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| He has a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| So, even though a motion to call the question prevails, your motion to call the question on the budget cannot happen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| You can only call the question on what Vice Mayor Becker proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Nick did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| Has there been a second to Councilman Greaves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Actually, now that it's clear, do you want to call the question on Vice Mayor Becker's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Everybody's ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Enough talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Sounds like that Jerry Clowers thing where you're up in the tree and someone says, shoot up here, we need relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| So, the motion, what you're voting on right now is whether to call the question on Vice Mayor Becker's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| So, it's not to vote for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| It's just I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| I've talked enough about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| All those in favor of calling the question, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| I heard Becker and Pavlis' no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Are there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| So, I have six ayes and two no's to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| So, that means we are going to move toward voting on Vice Mayor Becker's proposal, which is, give us that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Can't you give it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| It's a half and half split the baby deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| It's a split the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| It would fully fund the Mercer plan, but instead of pulling that money either completely from the Rainy Day Fund or completely from capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4406)|
| 1:13:38| it's half from the Rainy Day Fund and half from capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| It funds the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| It provides prudence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| And I think it's a serious way to help the employees and be good managers of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| So, a half a million from the capital budget and a half a million from Rainy Day Fund to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| The motion's been called, so there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Let me clarify that, because I thought his original motion was to fund half and half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| and I'm not sure we're clear that the figure is $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| So is your motion to find out in the future what the figure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| and utilize half of those funds from capital funds and half of those from fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| No, mine would actually be $500,000 and $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| I mean, we've been using a million as the figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| You're going to use the actual million-dollar figure, whether it's correct or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| For purposes of the discussion here, knowing that Mr. York is going to go back and redo the budget, I feel safe doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I just want to clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| Everybody ready then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Okay, go ahead and call the roll again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| So now we're back to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| I'd like to call the question on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Was that a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Actually, there's no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| There's no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| We can vote on this to continue discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| So, yes, just to be clear, this would be a motion to cut off debate rather than continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| If we can find a way to fund the employees' pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Let's go ahead just in the better sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Let me ask a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Is there some way to append anything to that to say that in January we will take a second look at where we are fiscally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4555)|
| 1:16:04| The current motion is to call the question, and we can't append that to the call the question motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| So all we're voting on now is calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| All those in favor of calling the question on the budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Actually, let's go through it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| We better just make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I'd like to make my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Now, Mr. Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| I would like to move to approve the budget as presented with an addendum that the administration take a look and report back to this council no later than January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4603)|
| 1:16:55| the first meeting in January, as to whether the revenues or receipts have increased sufficient so that we could fund the remaining portion of the Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4615)|
| 1:17:06| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| I really think that because the charter requires a budget to be set in a particular ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4634)|
| 1:17:23| essentially what you're doing is surplusage and advisory to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| And I have, frankly, no doubt that if you add that to a motion to approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| that the administration will pay attention to what you're saying and probably will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| But I do not believe it is actually technically legal to do it or that it will be legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| That we're not requiring it, but we're asking that it be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| And so there's, I mean, there's no legal enforceability to that, so I don't want anybody to think that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4679)|
| 1:18:09| Really, in terms of the charter requiring a budget ordinance to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| I'm a little concerned about adding surplusage that doesn't have any legal impact to that particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| Now, you could do a separate resolution that requests and encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| and, you know, pleads with the administration to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| But I think it would be much better to do that by a separate resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| than by some type of surplusage amendment to the budget ordinance itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4718)|
| 1:18:46| because it really would not be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Vice Mayor, and then I'll go to Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| We're in an interesting situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| And, Ms. Roddy, you're right to look at me like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| That was unfortunate the way I talked after the motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| But the truth is there are six of the eight people around here who have voted in some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| or fashion tonight to fully fund the Mercer pay plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| So I think it's clear where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| And I think it's incumbent on us to figure out how to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| I would love to explore some ways to go back to Ms. Roddy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| And I guess, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Actually, I looked again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| You were on the prevailing side of that motion because that motion was defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| And you voted to defeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| And so you were on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| So you can make a motion to reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| I apologize for giving you the wrong information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| I was thinking along those lines, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I'd like to make a motion to reconsider Ms. Roddy's amendment to fund the Mercer plan and pull money out of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4793)|
| 1:20:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Councilman Bailey has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Well, I'm not going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Well, you actually, I kind of circumvented you before, Bob, so I'm going to let you go ahead and speak anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| even if it's not to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I was going to ask Mr. Martin if he would share with us one of the options they looked at earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| that where we would forego the two and a half percent pay increase along with the half of the third year of the Mercer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4825)|
| 1:20:35| and how until January and how would you achieve that financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| Councilmember Bailey, we did look at various scenarios, which did include, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| the delay of any change of salaries until January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| So it wouldn't be, the two and a half wouldn't be done July 1st, nor any of Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| All of that would be delayed until January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| And I think I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Mr. York can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| There would be similar funding for that to what we're proposing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| So we would be able to implement the two and a half and the full Mercer, but it wouldn't be effective until January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| And what is the benefit of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| How do you achieve that financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Well, you avoid those increases for an entire year, I mean half a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| You have six months of that lower salary amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| And we looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| We looked at various other scenarios, taking the two and a half, doing half of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| you know, all sorts of different arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| And, you know, those dollars are not going to match up perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| But, again, we, the administration came to the conclusion that this budget was the fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| and best way to address what we needed to do compensation-wise for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| Well, and I would be interested in hearing from the employee group to see what their response to that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Like Council Vice Mayor Becker said earlier, I think the will is here, the intent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| I mean, we're going into the third year of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| And all along we thought things would be good where we could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| But with the economy, we're just going to have to find another means to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| So if anybody would like to speak to this from the employees group, I'd like to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4943)|
| 1:22:35| Kevin, I think the question was, one of the things the administration considered was delaying the two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| going in and doing the full Mercer and delaying the two and a half until Jan and Anita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| you can speak on it too, whichever one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| I'd like to hear from Mr. Faddis first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Hi, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Thanks for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| I think the question that I'd like to pose is, do we even remember why we had the Mercer plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4977)|
| 1:23:07| Honest to goodness, do we remember why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| It's because we were underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| We're not looking to cut funding anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| We're not looking to get money from somebody else's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| We're not looking to get the money out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| That's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Next year, you know, like I said, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| We do understand the economic hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| And next year, it's a whole new ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| I mean, this would complete the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| But the Mercer plan, delaying it until January, it just puts us further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| How so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Well, if it doesn't implement, and I'm going to ask a question because I'm not sure Mr. Mark might be able to answer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| or Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| The three-year plan was supposed to get us to the 50th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| We're only at two years, you know, half a year waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| Still not going to get us where we need to be, where we agreed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Whether we're a little bit above, whether we're a little bit below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| I mean, I've asked the question, maybe some of us, not as firemen, but as employees in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| maybe some of us will make a little more in market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| What's wrong with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I mean, honestly, it's a great place to live, work and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| It's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Be able to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| Would you support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Would I support the holding it off for six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| I think it puts us further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I mean, I'll do what my body wants me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| I'd really have to confer with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I don't want to speak out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Do you have a question for me, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| It does not appear to me from what we're doing tonight that that money is going to come out of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| And you said you don't want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| I believe Ms. Roddy's motion is to shift it from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| Yes, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Are you in favor of that or are you not in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| I am in favor of that, but that's not the original plan that I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| We originally came up, and I want this to be known, we don't want to cut anybody's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| No one's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| No one's whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| But if that's the way it comes, Council agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Well, I hate to use this phrase, Joe, Councilman Bailey, but we've been there, done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| I just want to know if you support it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| This is a recommendation that the administration shared with us, and, you know, I'm just curious whether you would support it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| I know you don't benefit from it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I benefit from the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| So if you take my two and a half and you don't give it to me in July, I'm cheated out of a whole half a year of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| I've been here through layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I've been here when we didn't have a rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I've been here when the two and a half was put off until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| I've been here when the city didn't put one red cent in the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| So, no, we don't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| If you could give your name and address, please, since this is your first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| Your Honor, Mark Taylor, 107 Debbie Sue Road, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| I would not be in favor of delaying the two and a half percent until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| It's my understanding that if the conditions to do that is that if the money is not available to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| obviously by the budget the money is available for the two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| We would just ask for some consideration and maybe, you know, I would be okay with Ms. Roddy's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| I appreciate the gesture there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| I think it's honest and good intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| I appreciate the gesture from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Either one of those would be acceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| But the delay in the two and a half, the implementation of that is about 3.7 percent for the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5254)|
| 1:27:44| which roughly comes out to the average low-ranking police officer of around $500 difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| in the pay raise that they'll get this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| And if you delay that pay raise, the two and a half percent, they'll lose that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| or probably more in those remaining six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| So it's kind of like I'm going to give you a pay cut for six months to give it back to you six months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| but that doesn't work for us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Counselor Dela Bobbi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Can we call the question on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Oh, the half and half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| No, the reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| The motion is to reconsider Ms. Roddy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Okay, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| Okay, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| Mr. Swanson, would you review the rules of reconsideration, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| Well, the motion has to be made by someone who was on the prevailing side of the previous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| There were six people on the prevailing side of the vote on your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| One of those persons has made a motion to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| which means that if a majority of the members of council wish to reconsider that with the motion having actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5339)|
| 1:29:08| because we're at the same meeting, it only has to have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| If we were at the next meeting, it would take a super majority of six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| At this meeting, it only takes a simple majority of five votes for the council to decide to reconsider that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Okay, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| I'm just going to ask Ms. Roddy if she wouldn't mind to restate that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| The motion was to fully fund the Mercer plan in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| To do that, you would redirect funds from the debt service fund that are currently being used to fund the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5384)|
| 1:29:52| and you would reduce the capital improvement plan expenditures by a like amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| So if fully funding the Mercer plan is $800,000, then you would reduce the capital improvement plan by $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| A question, I guess while I have, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| I guess a further question for Mr. Martin or Mr. York would be if this motion should pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| and then the administration would reconsider the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| what opportunity for debate will exist for council regarding that capital improvement plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| It's an all or nothing take, is that correct, on a revised capital improvement plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| I'm not sure we've been faced with this issue before, but if I'm understanding your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| is that you're asking the administration to come back with a budget that fully funds the Mercer plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5446)|
| 1:30:54| and comes back with a smaller capital budget is what you're asking us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| So we would have to go back and go through that process because we've got a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| As Mr. York explained, we'd have to come back with the civil service ordinance relative to the pay grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5467)|
| 1:31:15| and the ranges and all of that because we'd have to go in and change all of that to make it the full Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| Plus, we would have to take into consideration in the capital budget where those cuts would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| And I assume your opportunity then for input would be when we came back with those proposals to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| because ultimately we need your approval, which we have to have or need to have by the end of the day, June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| I guess I'm thinking in regards to the specifics of the capital improvement plan, this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| say you pull out all the bridge improvements and council just feels like that's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Our only option is to not approve the capital improvement plan as opposed to a line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5513)|
| 1:32:02| in the capital improvement plan. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| But that's an essential cog in the wheel of the budget. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| So if the capital improvement plan comes back and is distasteful to any one district member or any one council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| and the capital improvement plan is not approved, then that shoots the budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| I would argue you'd never want to approve one without the other because they are married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| I think there's a little more complicating factor in that there will be one more person sitting around the table in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| And I'm actually going to push for a second on Mr. York's provision that we have to come back with a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| all these revised ordinances, and Mr. Swanson, maybe if you can weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| At some level it gets very frightening because if we have to come back and vote on this in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| the motions that have been going failing 4-4 could go different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| and we could have this fight all over again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I want to challenge Mr. York to see if there's a way we can do it all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| Can we say, here's what we want, and I'm willing to trust the administration to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| We want the budget to be, you know, fully fund Mercer, cut capital by a million, redo the pay plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5591)|
| 1:33:19| and we're not going to vote on it in two weeks because I can see this same discussion happening in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| if we have to come back on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| And I would love to hear an answer that makes it easier because it could be very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Regardless of the procedure, unless you know what's going to be cut out of that capital budget, how do you make that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| We trust you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| But you could easily then say, oh, if I'd known you were going to cut that, I wouldn't have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| I mean, I hear you and I appreciate that, but that leaves you saying, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| I thought there would be a better alternative than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| Personally, I've looked at all the ways of cutting and I don't think there is a good alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| So I'm not going to blame you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| But, yeah, you're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| We're in a sticky place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Councilman Del Boffi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Well, there is an easy way to cut through all of that, and that is to withdraw your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| and act on the question of approving the budget as presented, as hearings have been held on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| and as a lot of us think is fiscally prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| There's also the option of voting on whatever tonight and it comes up in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| and we see what happens in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| I mean, there are lots of ways we could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| I'd like to get it done tonight in some form or fashion because it does get more confusing later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| Right now the motion on the floor is to reconsider and it just takes a majority to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5687)|
| 1:34:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| So it's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| It's legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Seeing no further likes, we'll go ahead and go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5702)|

| 1:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| That motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| I'd like to call the question on the budget as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Moved and seconded to call the question on the budget as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| That being no, non-debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| All those, I'm going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| This is the motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| I'm going to try it by voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| All those in favor of calling the question, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5746)|

| 1:35:58| I'm going to ask for a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| What is this, to call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| The vote is just to call the question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| On the budget ordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| On the budget as presented, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Yes, call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5777)|

| 1:36:26| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| The motion fails three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| So we're back to discussing the budget as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| Anybody have anything they want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Step out back and solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| There has to be a way to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| So you just turned on your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I figured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| I think he's stalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| I think, you know, clearly I can think and talk at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| and conceivably go on for quite a long time doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| But I'm fresh out of answers of how to get to where we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| and I feel very frustrated at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| But clearly people here want to figure out a way to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| and there's another light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Councilman Bailey, thank you for saving us, him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| Mr. York, would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| I want to ask you a question about when we talk about the rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| our longstanding policy of not dipping into the rainy day fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| and what that means to our – what that generally means to those that watch our bond rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5862)|
| 1:37:53| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| We have a policy to not use non-recurring revenues for recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5876)|
| 1:38:08| If we were to take the step of using non-recurring revenues for recurring expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| then I would say that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| I would venture that the bond rating agencies would not look favorably upon that type of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5899)|
| 1:38:28| Is that what we do when we take the money out of the rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| We use non-recurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| If you were to use non-recurring revenues for non-recurring expenses, that would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5912)|
| 1:38:41| Salaries are deemed a recurring expense, and any adjustment for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| you would be taking non-recurring revenues, which is fund balance, to pay for recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| Which is the salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| And we also use this to bank our grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| We have almost all our grants are reimbursement grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| We have – that means we have to spend the money first and get reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| Typically, those have been fairly slow in coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| And so we have to have revenue to pay for those expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| and then basically wait until those revenues come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Similarly, what we're going to see from the state is the state's trying to shift their cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| And so when we do major capital projects, instead of the state doing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| and us paying the state, what you will see is that we are now undertaking projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| that would normally have been funded by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and we will have to wait and we'll have to front the cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| and at some point we'll have to wait upon the state to pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| So the fund balance is used to earn interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| It's used to provide that operating capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| It's used to, you know, cover those types of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| As I said earlier, I'm just not supportive of using the rainy day fund for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| and it's not only those issues but also that, you know, we try to reserve 15 to $20 million a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6007)|
| 1:40:15| say for three months, and that comes to about $50 million in case of a catastrophic event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| or something like that, which I don't think we ever will have or hopefully we will not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| The thing that I think is so important in this economic climate is we really need to protect ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| more so than we ever have because I don't think we can rely on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| We can't depend on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| We've seen that in the past where the whole income tax, you know, they withheld a lot of uncertainties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| And so, you know, I think it's more important now than ever that we hang on to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| and that if you look at the federal government, I mean, it's unbelievable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| the spending going on and the path we're going down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| And so I think we have a lot of uncertainty in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| But going back to this Mercer plan, I think that, you know, all along our intention was to fund it in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6067)|
| 1:41:17| And I still support that, and I think just about everybody here does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| But the question is, how do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| So that's why I supported finding some alternative means other than the rainy day fund, and I'm still open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6082)|
| 1:41:30| But as has been stated by Councilman de la Volpe a number of times, I mean, this is a very good budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and a very tough economy, no layoffs, no directors get a raise, and it pays for half of the third year of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6096)|
| 1:41:46| So I'm still open, but that's where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I'm going to go to Councilman Pavlos since you haven't talked in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| Mr. York, if you could come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| I'm a little confused because two hours ago in our dinner, our sunshine dinner, I want to make sure that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6116)|
| 1:42:07| I thought I understood you to say that if, you know, if the rainy day fund, for example, a million dollars was taken from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| that it would not harm our bond rate in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| So I just want clarification as to whether it would or it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| If our fund balance were a million dollars less, I do not think that that would necessarily jeopardize the bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6144)|
| 1:42:33| What I'm saying is that the bond rating agencies are going to look at your practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| and if we start a practice of funding recurring expenses with non-recurring revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| they will look upon that as a bad practice and that which could have some negative effect upon our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| It's a combination of both having reserves and following certain management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| And our practice has been, and again our policy says, is that we will not fund recurring expenses with non-recurring revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6180)|
| 1:43:09| And that's a policy that the bond rating agencies will look favorably upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| If you start deviating from that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| then I think they will look upon that as a management practice that should be avoided and they might start looking at, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6197)|
| 1:43:24| So if I hear you right, then if it was, you know, four or five years of that, then it could negatively affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| But if it was a one-time occurrence, then it would not affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| If we were to use, and again I'm going to repeat myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| if we were to start the practice of using non-recurring revenue for recurring expenses, be it one time, being it two times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6220)|
| 1:43:50| three times, whatever, that the bond rating agencies will look upon that as a poor financial practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| And, again, you know, I think they would not look favorably upon that practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| Councilman, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Yeah, Councilman Della Vota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| I want to commend all the council folks for wrestling with this issue in great detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6249)|
| 1:44:17| and the folks for presenting us information about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| I got my fanny whipped for trying to make an amendment to a motion by some procedural nuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| but here's the intent of what I'm suggesting is that we all want to see good things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6268)|
| 1:44:36| with the pay increases being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| If times turn better, then I think we should struggle mightily to pay these early rather than waiting a full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| And however we do it, and some parliamentarian among us who could suggest the proper method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| why don't we look again in January, if the revenue stream comes in, let's just get off our fanny and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| But in the meantime, I think we should put the budget in place and do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| and do a prudent thing for our city and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| This question, I guess, is for Mr. York or for Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| When my original motion was on the floor and the mayor spoke to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| he said that he was concerned about it because of a recurring expense and non-recurring income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| And I want to clarify, my intent was to fund the Mercer Plan with debt service funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| And those are recurring funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Now, I understand you're taking a non-recurring expense and replacing it with a recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| But the underlying income, the underlying revenue that would have provided for that was recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| What it would do is tie your hands further going forward because it has reduced your available amount to spend on capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6345)|
| 1:45:54| I think that's better said than the way I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| I've always stood for not paying for recurring expenses with non-recurring income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| And I want to make very clear that my original motion did not propose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| No, that is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| It does tie our hands further down the road in a way that it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| I guess first Mr. Gartner standing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| And I apologize, Dave, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I was trying to figure stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| And then after he's done, I've got just one more statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| I see there's a possible compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And like most compromises, it's kind of ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| That is that you do the current budget from the current funds and do a one-year complete Mercer plan for one year out of the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6389)|
| 1:46:41| Then it changes from a recurring cost to what will eventually be a recurring request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| So you could do that so that if the economy picks back up, it will be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| But if the economy continues to be bad, then it may have to be rolled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| But that's something that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| As I said, it's not necessarily pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Yeah, in effect sort of says we can give a raise and then not give it next year, which we would always have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6423)|
| 1:47:11| And we'd actually deal with it of having the two and a half be dealt with next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| I continue to struggle with a bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| I mean, you know, Mr. Haslam, you talked earlier about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| you don't want to use your savings account to pay your mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6445)|
| 1:47:33| You can use it to pay the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| The challenge, of course, is we can fix the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Fix the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| I'm sorry, fix the roof but not pay the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| The challenge we've got here is we're taking our paycheck and sending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| We want to send 70 cents of it to 70% of it to the checking account and 30% to the savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| And then to sit back and say, well, we can't pay the mortgage because the money is in savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| is just bizarre to me because we're choosing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| And there are plenty of ways here to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| I mean, Ms. Roddy is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| We have to change the ratio in effect of the money going into checking versus savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| to not have an issue with recurring, non-recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| And we sit back with a very large savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| I mean, it's not 52 million was impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| All the funds you total up are huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| And it's very frustrating not being able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| But at the moment, I don't see a way we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| And I guess my response, you're saying, well, we've kind of drawn an arbitrary, well, this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| this is recurring expenses, this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| But I think we've done that on the basis of historical real needs on capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| Like I said, there's not a lot of capital in this budget that's, you know, new project or something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| some great new thing that we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| This is basically the basic needs we think that we have to have to be responsible for the next generation to do our share of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| So if I felt like we had a bunch of, you know, yeah, exotic, sexy things in there, it would be one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6533)|
| 1:49:03| Well, and I guess the motion to reconsider didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| I'll just do one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| I mean, I looked at how we could get a million dollars from capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| And I don't like any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| It's pulling it from road paving and sidewalks and, frankly, LED Christmas lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| which are an expense we just put off for a year and use the old lights for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| and some from downtown north and alley paving, which I sort of have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| And none of this is at all fun, but it all sort of works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| It's something that if we don't do it now, we can pick it up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Yeah, the roads will suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6570)|
| 1:49:31| The alleys will suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| At some level, we can't make it up to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| And we can't make up a morale thing to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| But, like I said, I'm stuck at how we get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| So I think I'm just going to pause now and be frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Vice Mayor Becker, I'm trying to understand where you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| from the standpoint that we've been presented a budget that, as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| no one's being laid off, everybody's getting a 2.5% pay increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| plus they're doing 68% of the Mercer plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| and what we're asking the employees is that we're going to have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| because of the economic situation in terms of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| And I'm not quite sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| I understand that you want to do the whole plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| but I think also that just the idea that we can give a 2.5% pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| to everybody and then do what we can on the Mercer plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| I think that's a huge leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| And also the fact that no one is being laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| There's nobody losing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| And as the mayor says, you know, apparently they've picked this budget to the bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| and you don't want to see, or at least I personally do not want to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| our city do away with capital projects that we need to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| If we stop paving, if we stop sidewalks, if we stop things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| we're going to get further behind on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Now, to me, that would be totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| if we weren't giving all the employees a 2.5% pay increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| and doing as much as we can for the Mercer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| So I'm just trying to gauge exactly where you're coming from on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| I guess, you know, Mr. Roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| you talked earlier about how you've taken a pay cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| and you've laid employees off and you have a pay cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| and you took two weeks unpaid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| A couple of years ago I was in a similar situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| where there were employee lack of raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| And frankly, where it hurt me, I had to travel to Nashville all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| and I had to stay in a really cheap, crappy motel when I stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| And I didn't mind because I thought there was financial problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| And I came to the year and found out that we had a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| and a half's worth of the budget in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| And it kind of pissed me off because, at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| I was being asked to sacrifice while there was money sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| And I think that's what's frustrating about this here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| that there are big chunks of money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| And what's frustrating is, yes, the budget is very lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| The budget is very lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| And I think we have cut to the bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| There is a fund over here that's flush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| And we have worked very hard, as I said earlier, to keep that flush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| So it's frustrating to say we have to cut to the bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| we have to do all this when there is a huge bank account sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| And that's frustrating to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| So, again, I don't like the idea of pulling it for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| It's why I regret now voting against Ms. Roddy's proposal the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| because I think we can do it other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| I think I would feel just totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| if the administration had not made the efforts in which they've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| in terms of, again, no layoffs and a 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Now, granted, it would be great if we had 5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| But I think also what Councilman Della Vopi says is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| I think the administration understands where this council is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| and what their desires are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| And I see no reason that come January or February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| depending on what the finances are at that particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| we can take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| I know I'm just repeating the song,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| but I do think, I hear you, that there's this, you know, money there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| and we've cut to the bone, but we're living off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| But we're not touching this big savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| But, again, I'd come back to we've got to look a year or two down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| And I really don't want to be in a situation where we're coming back a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| two years from now, saying, okay, council, we have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| Either not do two and a half or we can have some layoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| And I just really, I mean, who knows where we'll be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| but I want to do everything I can not to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| So, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| It appears that we're at a standstill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| Actually, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| The motion on the floor is to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| So I was just letting discussion happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Actually, I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| I'm going to go ahead and go to the vote unless somebody picks the light on real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| This is the motion is to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6859)|
| 1:54:28| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6868)|
| 1:54:40| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Motion carries six to two and the budget is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| I know that was a long and painful discussion, but I appreciate the honest effort to try to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| At the beginning of the meeting, we talked a little bit about the RF ordinance, which is 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| and I kind of had it in my mind that if it got to 9 o'clock, it would probably be worth saying we're not going to have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| If it got to 9 o'clock and we were still dealing with the budget, we wouldn't have time to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| I know there's some people here on 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| We have another big item to deal with before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| I'm inclined to say 12B is not something we're going to get to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| I'm not going to make a motion to postpone at this point, but I don't think we're actually getting to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| And if you wanted to do anything, Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| 12B is an item dealing with R4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| I have one person signed up to speak to it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| So just for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| So are you saying we jump to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| No, he was saying that we would move to postpone it was his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| To postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| I'm glad somebody understood what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| You said we're not going to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| We'll eventually get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| I don't think we're going to get there and have a good discussion about it, I guess is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| So in deference to the people here, it might be worth postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| We have a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Mr. Grieve, did you want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| I was just going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| I know we've had several people sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Terry Faulkner has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Is that okay, Terry, if we just go ahead and postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Yes, and I was going to add that it would be good during the postponement to perhaps think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| or schedule a council workshop on it and for council members to be thinking about what their vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| or what they want in this RFOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| I think we've made it really clear what we would like to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| and that it's going to be good if you know what you would like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| Well, what I was going to say, if I can add to that, is that I handed out to you folks, the council folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| and also to both Ms. Poplin and to Mr. Swanson, the changes that that group would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| and I think it would be a good idea that whether we call it a workshop or not, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| that we do ask that MPC set up a meeting with the neighborhood groups and go over these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7022)|
| 1:57:11| I don't know if you want to add that to amendment or just that's something we're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| Debbie, did you have anything to add to that or would you be willing to meet with us, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7034)|
| 1:57:21| We'd be willing to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| We've looked at it today and some of those are substantive amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Vice Mayor Becker, and then I'll come to Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| My gut is just to postpone it because I think there are some longer discussions about not just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| let's ask somebody else to consider this, but let's talk about what the citizens group has so ably provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| So I just suggest, and a longer discussion about what might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| that's why I'm just going to say let's just postpone it two weeks and pick it up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| I see some mics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| My concern is that we deal with this efficiently, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| and we did see the handout tonight from the neighborhood groups that have a number of suggestions to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| and I know there's a procedural question here as to whether or not those changes are substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| and would require a referral back to MPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| I guess I don't want to schedule a workshop prematurely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| and I would like to see what changes can come back to us after the neighborhood groups meet with MPC and with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7099)|
| 1:58:27| and maybe miraculously we'll get a product back that doesn't have to be bounced back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| It would save MPC time and money, and it might be a product that we could debate and vote on without a workshop as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| So I would like to offer a substitute motion to postpone for a little longer, maybe four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| to allow some more substantive changes to take place on this ordinance and then bring it back to us and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| There was a second to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| The motion was a substitute motion to postpone for four weeks instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Mr. Becker, do you want to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| I actually disagree because there's some of what Ms. Faulkner and the citizens provided that I like, some that I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| and I don't want MPC and the law department talking about all those things before we've looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| and given them some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| I'm very concerned about the efficiency of their time as well as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| So that's why I'm suggesting just two weeks and then pick it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| and have some hard discussion here about what's been proposed, what we do want folks to consider, and what we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7161)|
| 1:59:31| Can you come back in two weeks so that you can inform us about what the neighborhoods want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| We'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Sorry to inconvenience you, but I think we want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| Just so we're clear, right now there's a substitute motion on the floor to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| That's the motion that's on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| We're going to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Right now there's a substitute motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I heard Dela Volpe and Becker as noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| Do I have any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| The motion passes six to two to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Thank you, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Thanks, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| Nine B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7213)|

| 2:00:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| We could try and amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| See what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| But, no, I think we've been down that road, and I'm glad everybody laughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Seeing no light, ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7253)|

| 2:01:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Mr. Mayor, just as a point of reference, has this already been taken into account with the new budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7278)|
| 2:01:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Those numbers are in the new budget numbers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Is there anywhere, if there are specific classifications that need relooking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| that that can be initiated through the Civil Service Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| so that if there is a particular one that stands out downstream, we can fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| Yeah, why don't you, Melissa, if you want to take a swing at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| Well, it's a very civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Yes, there is a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| Employees can apply for a reclassification or reallocation in December, usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| that would take effect next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| We also watch for problem job classifications in the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| The reason I ask that is I remember speaking to one of the police representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| and they were saying that some of the step increases didn't seem quite right to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| and I thought, well, that sounded like your department needed to be wrestling with that rather than us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| Each of the steps was increased two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| Each of the steps, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Those steps based on a temporal time in grade, in other words, it's three years or whatever time frame you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| The only way to get out of that is to get a promotion to a different grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| Is that what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| After.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7369)|

| 2:02:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7371)|

| 2:03:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7387)|

| 2:03:10| We will start again in five minutes, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=7390)|
