| 0:00:07| Knox County Commission on this Monday, the 15th of 2007. So, clerk, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7)|
| 0:00:15| Commissioner Strickland, Commissioner Mark Harmon, Commissioner Norman, Commissioner Ivan Harmon, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=15)|
| 0:00:23| Commissioner Lutho, Commissioner Lambert, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Moore, Commissioner Ballard, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=23)|
| 0:00:38| We have eight members present. I think one has been caught up behind a wreck. Commissioner Ivan Harmon has an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=38)|
| 0:00:47| He said he'd be here as soon as he could. So we'll go ahead and get started. Clerk, first item of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=47)|
| 0:01:17| Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 5-5-105, the Chair of the Knox County Commission hereby calls a special session of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=77)|
| 0:01:29| Knox County Commission for Monday, October 15, 2007 at 8 o'clock a.m. in the main assembly room of the City-County Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the purpose of addressing the matters set forth in the Mayor's written application to WIT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| determining if a special election can be held and what steps must be taken to conduct such an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Okay. I guess at this time, Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you calling the meeting today. Since the judges' ruling, I guess a little over a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| many citizens have voiced their interest in having a special election. This is a process, obviously, which is not very well defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| but I hope it would be something that we could pursue. I would hope that the body today might consider passing a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| asking the Governor, the Coordinator of Elections, and also the Chancellor to work together to see if we could have a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| in this community. Our citizens want it. Some people would say it may not be possible. If that's the case, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| But until we explore all avenues of possibilities, I think we should go forward in that type of manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| So that was the purpose of my meeting, asking the Chairman to call the meeting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| I do think this is the best way to address this issue if it's possible. If it's not possible, then obviously this body will need to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| another mechanism to work and go forward with. However, we found ourselves in tough situations before. I remember it wasn't that long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| when our charter was overturned and we were able to put it back together, had an election, put things in place in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| and our government continued in the way that people wanted. I would hope that we'd try and take a similar step as it comes to an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| So with that said, I will let the body deliberate on what the possibilities may be. I know Mr. Owings has done some research in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| Many of you have voiced your support of such an initiative. And if possible, I would like to see it go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| and us have a special election to fill the vacant seats. And I'll be glad to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| Okay. Commissioner Luto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to put forth a motion that we do as the Mayor said and ask the state officials that would be in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=211)|
| 0:03:42| of possibly having a special election, ask them if they could reconsider and see if this community can have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Okay. Any discussion on it? Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| I guess the Law Director or the Mayor, one, it doesn't matter, how long are we looking at here that this would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| until we have an answer, we hear something this week, will it take a month, how long will it take to get an answer from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| I don't have the answer to that. I would hope that commissioners would include as a part of their motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| I think you mentioned the election coordinator, governor, chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Election coordinator, the governor, the state attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| I mean, I know that's a legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| See if it's possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And if it is, then, of course, then we would have to try to work with our local election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=265)|
| 0:04:33| and try to work out those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| So I understand we have one in February, but if we can move everything up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| then I always, always think that the people should have their voices heard through an election at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=280)|
| 0:04:52| Mr. Owens, do you have any dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Have you researched any dates, anything on the timetable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| I've got, I guess, a pretty good bit to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| It's more than just dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| You know, as far as when the attorney general will get back to us with an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| we have no way of knowing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| The, I read where our senators have asked for an attorney general's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=319)|
| 0:05:30| And so maybe it can be, you know, forthcoming within the next few days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| But let me read to you a response that we received from Ms. Janet Kleinfelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| Janet is the attorney general who has represented the state, i.e., Brooke Thompson, the coordinator of elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=346)|
| 0:05:58| in a couple of cases here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| and cases that dealt with our term limits issues and cases that dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| that would be, she was also here in the Moody cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| And we have talked to her before about having special elections, and she's given us her opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| This time we asked her, and she's put it in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| because we, Mary Ann Stackhouse, sent her an e-mail and told her that this issue was arising once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=385)|
| 0:06:35| and we needed some guidance, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| I would state that Janet Kleinfelter can recite to you chapter and verse and sentence of our election laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=400)|
| 0:06:50| She is, I would think, an expert, if anyone is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| This is what she says to whether at this time we can have a special election to fill these 12 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=415)|
| 0:07:08| She says, Mary Ann, the simple answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Even assuming that the court has the authority to order a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| there would not be enough time to conduct a primary in December and a general in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| But before you even get to that issue, I don't think the court has any authority to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| The situation, and keep in mind, this is not an official opinion of the attorney general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| This is one attorney general giving us her opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Now, she may be the one writing the opinion for General Cooper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| but this is what she has certainly said before about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| and what, if she were standing here before us, she would be saying today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| She says, but before you even get to that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| I don't think the court has any authority to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| The situation in Jackson was completely different in that the city was physically unable to conduct an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| on election day due to the tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Many of the precincts had been damaged and were unusable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and the vast majority of them did not have electricity so that the voting machines could not be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| The election commission was not in a position to suddenly print thousands of paper ballots, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Now, Mr. Monsier, in some of his papers, has stated that there's precedent for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| and the precedent is the Jackson, Tennessee situation where you had the tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| And there was a, you could call it a special exception, created for the folks in Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| And Janet Kleinfelter does not believe that that situation certainly exists here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=519)|
| 0:08:48| It's not an emergency, which in Jackson it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| She says, here there is no evidence that an election cannot physically be held at the scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| She goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| She says here, the legislature has put in place a very methodical process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| for dealing with the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| TCA Section 5-1-104B and 5-5-102I both provide that where there are vacancies in the offices in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=549)|
| 0:09:20| those vacancies are to be filled by the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| and those persons who are appointed serve until the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| TCA 2-14-101 only authorizes special elections to fill a vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| when that vacancy, quote, is required to be filled by election at other times than those fixed for general elections, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| The case law has made it clear that you cannot hold an election with an express grant of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| without an express grant of power from the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| The plain language of this statute makes it clear that you cannot hold a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| when a vacancy is required to be filled at the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Consequently, there is no authority to hold a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| and the Jackson election, in my opinion, does not provide sufficient authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| for the court to order one contrary to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Furthermore, even if the court were to decide to ignore the statutes and order a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| there simply isn't time to conduct a primary in December and the general in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| TCA 2-14-102 provides that special elections shall be held not less than 75 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| no more than 80 days after the officer of body charged with calling the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| receives notice of the facts requiring the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Assuming the court were to issue an order today, and this was October the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| the earliest that you could hold the primary would be December 23rd, which is a Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| Qualifying petitions would have to be filed by November the 15th, pursuant to TCA 2-14-106A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| Even if you held the elections the next day, Christmas Eve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| you would then be holding your general election in 43 days, February the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| Finally, it should be noted that the election process for the February primary is already under way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| Pursuant to TCA 2-5-1025,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| nominating petitions for the February 5th primary have been available for almost a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| and the qualifying deadline for that primary is the second Thursday in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| and she cites, which is only two months away, and she cites TCA 2-5-101A2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| She says, so back to my original answer, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| even if the court had the authority to order a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| which in the State's opinion he does not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| there simply isn't time to conduct a special primary election in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and then the general election in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| So that's the State Attorney General's answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| at least to our inquiry into whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| first of all, whether the court has the authority to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| And the court has previously said, back last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| that it didn't have the authority to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| The court, if the court were to order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| if the court were to ignore the statutes and order a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| as Janet says, then there's still not enough time pursuant to State law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| in order to accomplish that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| We don't have the authority over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Mr. You want me to tell them this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| My able assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| Mr. Monsier, oh, yeah, he sent us a joint motion to alter the judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| to ask the Chancery Court to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| We can distribute those to you for your consideration on October 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| He sent us that Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| So, you know, you've heard the state's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| and I'm not sure when they will get a formal response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| That's about as formal as you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| without having the Attorney General's signature on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| That's the position that the state has taken in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| and that's the position that they continue to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| They are at least consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| But I guess we await official formal word from the State Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| to an opinion that's been requested, as I understand it, by our state senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| Okay, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| As I see it, there are three things I'd like to address this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| First of all, I believe that we owe it to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| to exhaust every step of the way, if you will, on this special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| It may not be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| I know it's in the hand of the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I have had no one, no one say to me that they want an appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| that they want an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| But, again, if it's not possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| then I think the second thing that we should do is look at changing the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Who would have thought January 31 we would be sitting here again with 11 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and we'd be going through this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| I certainly didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| And so I would like to see us initiate or, in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| look at changing either state law or changing our charter to provide for a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| so that we don't have to go through all of this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| And I'm not sure all of the procedures that we would need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| but that's for a future discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| But I think that we definitely need to look at changing the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| so we can look at a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Third thing I would suggest we do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| while we're waiting on the Attorney General opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| and while we're looking at all of these options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| let's move ahead with the appointment process and how we would do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| and look at how the procedure would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Because if, indeed, the Attorney General comes back and says that we can't have this special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| then at least we've got the procedures in place to see how the appointment process would move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Actually, Mike, I thought we might be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| But what I'm thinking about here is listening intently to what the Law Director just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| What we're talking about is a non-binding opinion from an assistant to the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| writing to the Deputy Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| First, I think this is important enough that the top persons in each organization should be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| And secondly, I don't think that's sort of substantive enough for us to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| We've relied on Attorney General opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We've relied on our own guesses to the interpretation of certain laws and been wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| So why not proceed simply with the request, find out for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| even if it means that it has to require something extraordinary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| such as a quickly called meeting of the state legislature to pass special legislation for us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| It's worth doing it that way because the overwhelming sentiment we keep running across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| is that people want their franchise back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| They were disenfranchised through a whole series of actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| and they simply want the chance as quickly as possible to have their voice heard in every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| and for commissioners who think countywide on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| So I tend to agree with Mike Hammond's position that we need to press forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| sure we should lay down procedures in the case that we are stuck with an appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| but we should definitely press forward today on all the involved parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| The Chancellor, maybe his equity law power does include the ability to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| The Attorney General, beyond his ability to issue opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| that the first court ruling could at least theoretically override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| And, of course, the legislators, the local legislative delegation and the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| all of them should hear our plea and our public's plea that this should be an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| A motion on the floor is to, I guess, to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Is public comment appropriate, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Mr. Monsier, if you want to speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Just give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Robert Monsier, Suite 775 Mike Americus Center in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| When this issue came up before the commission in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I wanted to come down and speak that we were playing on the wrong field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| We were talking about in Knox County going to the legislature for a special act to permit us to have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| It was my contention in January, and I did not speak at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| and I apologize, that the proper place to rectify what had happened in Knox County was in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| not in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| We are at that same crossroads here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Mr. Owens, before I left my office, I watched him on TV speaking of a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| We're talking about the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| We have never had an election in Knox County for these offices, a valid election in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| It's void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Because candidates were allowed to be on the ballot for these 12 offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| the law in Tennessee is as clear as a bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| and no one will challenge me on the fact that the 2006 elections for these 12 offices were void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| When something is void in Tennessee under Comer v. Ice, that means it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| It's a nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| We are talking in January, and the chancellor talked about vacancies in offices that never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| All we have to do is declare the 2006 elections void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| and TCA 217.115 gives Chancellor Fensler the authority to order new elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| New elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| We're talking about special elections with the state election mechanics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| That's state election law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I'm talking about a constitutional new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| because the people of Knox County never had a valid election to fill these posts to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| So, therefore, there were no vacancies in January as a result of your actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| because those offices could not be vacated to where they had never been constitutionally filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Now, had the 2006 elections been valid, constitutionally valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| and those officers were sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| and then something later happened, a death, a misfeasance in office, a resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| then there would have been a vacancy in office to which this special election law would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| I have other arguments with Ms. Kleinfelder that I have had for several years over her interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| I think she's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I think that Mr. Thompson is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| They have become cemented, unfortunately, in the litigation that I have pursued with regard to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| and their position has been made known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| And, quite frankly, Chancellor Fensler adopted their position in March of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| with regard to a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Let's stop talking about a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Let's talk about an election, period, a valid constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| And what I wrote to Mr. Owens and what I'm asking this commission to do is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| Join with me in going back before Chancellor Fensler and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| we don't care about a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| What we want is an election, a valid constitutional election for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| And he has authority to do that under 217-105-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| It says that if an election is declared to be void, a court can order a new election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| That's a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Now, we've never talked about a new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| because nobody's ever gone back and looked at the 2006 elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| and said, were those valid constitutional elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| You all were put in a terrible situation in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Believe it or not, I empathized with the problem that you all had facing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| It was a terrible situation you all were put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| But you were put in the situation because nobody ever went back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| OK, Jordan, these offices have never been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| Knox County has never had a valid 2006 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Knox County needs to have a 2006 valid election for these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Period. Paragraph. End of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| The Constitution controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| I have a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| What would that do to if we just had the 2006 election voided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| Well, number one, would that mean that everybody has to run again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Only as to the 12 offices is it void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| What about all of the actions taken by this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| They're de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| It could be considered de facto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| A government operates de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| There was never any question in the Jordan litigation from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| with me representing Commissioner Smith and the citizens in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| that government continued to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| The actions of government were de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And that's exactly what the Supreme Court held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| So the actions of the Knox County Commission since September 1, 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| including those actions of these officers that are now void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| is a de facto government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| And even if that weren't applicable, there are 11 of you who acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So you acted by a quorum anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| The only issue, it seems to me, that we stand in in Knox County today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| have these offices ever been lawfully filled by a constitutional election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| that is free and equal and was on a pure ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Article 1, Section 5 of the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Article 4, Section 1 of the Tennessee Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| There is nobody, there is nobody that is going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| that Knox County had a constitutional election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| as to these 12 offices in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| And if they didn't, those offices were never filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| When those offices have never been filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| and those elections are declared to be void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| 217-105-B says that that chancellor, Fanzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| has the power to order a new election, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, there's just no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Now, they don't talk about that in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| because they're not talking about the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and they're not talking about a void office or a void election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| That discussion has never been held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| that the 2006 elections were void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I've taken way too much time, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Are you done, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you, Mr. Monseer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| As you look at this possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| what are some problems that you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| what are legal problems that you'd see for Mr. Chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| for the chancellor, I'm sorry, for Chancellor Fanzler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Well, let's assume for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| that this commissioner and Mr. Owens and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| are co-petitioners in a case together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I mean, that would be unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| but you know the truth of the matter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| it would be for the betterment of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| I'm willing to stand up and join with somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| and I'm asking you to do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| because if this commission, my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I know what Mr. Hollow's clients want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| they're joining in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| If the three of us join together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| for the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| and we go before Chancellor Fanzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| who's going to appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| And if the state election commissioner wants to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| let him appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Let him tell the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| that the state of Tennessee doesn't recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| their right to have a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| He'll lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Who else is going to appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Who else is going to appeal in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| As I understand it, every one of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| are for what you've heretofore called a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| and I'm trying to get you off of that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and get you on to a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Mr. Pinkston has debated the Constitution with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and has read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| And I suggest that he, likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| would join in us having a constitutional election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| a free and equal election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| on a pure ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| So the answer to yours is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| he gets reversed on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| I've got the case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| and I've given it to Mr. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and they haven't had it very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| But I've got the case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| He isn't going to get reversed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Okay, if, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| if Chancellor Fanzler rules in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| of this new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| and there was an immediate appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| what would that do in terms of timing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Well, first of all, they're going to have to get a stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| They've got to get a stay from an appellate court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| I don't think an appellate court's going to stay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| How can any court in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| say that Knox County can't have a constitutional election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Not whether you can have a special election or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Forget about a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I don't want a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Special elections were passed for something completely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| than what we're talking about has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| to the people of this community in 2006 and 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Quite frankly, the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| have been disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| They've been disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| And you've all been put right back in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Not by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| You shouldn't have been put in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| The court should have taken care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And I'm not speaking of any particular court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| The Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Well, I would have liked the last paragraph...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| We have to go back to the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Yes, sir. Mr. Owens, I'm inclined to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I was very disappointed in the last paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| of the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Because the last paragraph of the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| left the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| that these were vacancies in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| They did not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And quite frankly, in Jordan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| remedies were never argued by the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| before the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| That sort of came... I mean, they gave that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| But they didn't go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| which a court could have said in January of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| had I had a little more credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| back in January, maybe, than I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| But I had it before the courts in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| to say, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| These offices are void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| because they were filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| by void elections in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| No court has ever addressed that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| But it is. Nobody's going to argue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I think that maybe back in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| they had the wrong messenger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Had the state election coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| gone in in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| or had this commission gone in in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| or had the election commission gone in in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| and said, hey, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| These elections are void. They would have won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Okay. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| does Mr. Monsier's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| does this have any chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| at working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| I'm on, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| We can always hope that it has a chance of working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| But what you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I mean, I don't know that there's too many of us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| that would disagree that we would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Say a valid election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I can't believe I'm going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Well, I've got an alternative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| If you'd like to make an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I'd be happy to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| You have the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| who is saying one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| and they've been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| You have the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| which also said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| something very significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| and they said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| on January the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| and they pointed us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| where this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| fills vacancies in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We just had a chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| to declare vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Under the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Constitution, under the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Constitution, it is this body's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| responsibility to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| request to have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I'm all for it if it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| the attorney general certainly weighing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| with their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| which has been upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| at least it's been ruled on by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| as Mr. Monsier says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| by Chancellor Fansler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| The state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| is very doubtful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| this court has jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| to order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| It still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| puts us in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| wait and see mode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| to see what the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| is going to opine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I don't know if that's still going to be good enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| for each member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I know it won't be for Mr. Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| He will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| to insist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| that the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| has the authority no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| the state attorney general says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| and will proceed accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| What do you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| want your law director to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Do you want me to petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| the court and ask the court to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| order a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Well, that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| We haven't had a vote yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I would add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| that you all ought to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| You will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I believe, the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| on the other side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| You may have the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| on the other side of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| It is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| a general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| that we are seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| our highest court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| in this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| has given us the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| We've followed that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| we need to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| to follow that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| which is what the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Even if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| as you heard from Janet Kleinfelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| through her email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| she says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| there's not enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| a primary and a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| pursuant to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| There's not enough days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| to get it accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| and to do it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| The other side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| well, you know, we can shorten the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| We can always do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| and the chancellor can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| But there's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I think, a lot of opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| We can always ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| ask for that relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| but I would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| I don't think I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| give it a whole lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I don't believe it will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I don't believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| the chancellor will order a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| I don't believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| because of what he has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| in the past that he feels like he has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| to do it. So don't get your hopes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| That's what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| But it's probably worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I agree. I think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I'm prepared to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| if that's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| But I think that before we get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| where we redo the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| that we exhaust all resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| and that we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| everything possible to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| an election or a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And so what my proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| is is that we do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| We go with Craig's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| and we go with Herb's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| We try them both simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| and pray that one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I'll make an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I'll be happy to accept if the second will accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| that we go down both paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I'll make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| That we go with both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Craig's plan of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| asking for a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| and simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| go with Herb's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Petition the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| to order a constitutional election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| for the 2006 offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| of the 12 persons only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Petition the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| for a new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| because the 2006 elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| were void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| That's my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Mr. Monsignor, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| You said it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| You said, well, it didn't really matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| because we operated on votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| that we'd had a majority of the 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| if the argument was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| The question that concerns me more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| is about the countywide elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| If the elections didn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and with the arrest that the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| had made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| in the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Sheriff Hutchison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| would they be void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| if there were no sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I have said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| When I first filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| the very first term limit litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| concerning Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I said it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| I've said it every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I have appeared before any judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| in Knox County, and I say it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| that the acts of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| in carrying out the governmental affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| of Knox County are de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Now, there are other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| pertaining to the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| and privileges of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I'll be very frank with you about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| as far as Sheriff Hutchison being appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| in his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| I don't want to exclude that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| That's a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| As far as what your question is, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| as to the arrest in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| as to the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| and functions of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| as to the acts of the other three fee officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| those are de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| And valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Why would the pension be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| whether Mr. Hutchison was a sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| or just an officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| He still worked for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| for a certain number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| that entitles him to a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Why would you want to throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| that into question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| I don't want to throw it into question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| because that should not be an issue here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| However, I'll be happy to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| There's a case called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| State X-Real v. Thornton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| that says a public officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| who is unlawfully appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| to the office to which they hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| does not benefit from that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| That's a different issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| As far as if Sheriff Hutchinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| went out and made an arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| during that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| all of the functions that he took as sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| during those periods of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| those are perfectly lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Is there any way we can amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| the language of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Because I do not want to call that into question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| That man gave most of his adult life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| to this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| and did a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| for our sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| and modernization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| And I do not want to call anything like that into question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| I think it's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I think he said it's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| I see it as a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Well, let's just stay on the topic today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| of trying to get an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| if that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I mean, that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Commissioner Lambert, can I suggest some precise wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Because it's clear to me that wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| would be important in your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Okay. Well, you and Commissioner Leuthold have been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| and see if this wording works for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| that we ask the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| the state legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Chancellor Fancer, the attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| to explore any method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| to achieve an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| to fill vacancies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| And second part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| that the commission joins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Herb Moncier's lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| to petition the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| regarding a voided election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| in an attempt to achieve a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| That would be the two parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| that I think have been put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| But you'll need to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| what date the election was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Avoiding the election of August 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| For the 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| For the 12 offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| It would also include the primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Yeah, you'd have to do the primaries, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Primary and general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| The primaries and general elections in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| for the 12 offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| for which there are no vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| And I would add that wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| and suggest that's the wording we should be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| If that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| That's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Let me get to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Are you talking about going down two different paths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| One, you're going to set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| a special call meeting to fill the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| And secondly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| then to proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| asking the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| for special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| The two parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| are asking the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| the state legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Chancellor Fancer, the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| to explore any method to achieve an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| to fill the 12 vacancies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| The second portion of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| is the commission joins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Herb Moncier's lawsuit to petition the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| for a voided election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| to a constitutional election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| regarding the primaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| and general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| of August 2006 regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| the 12 offices now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| We won't join his lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| but we will join in with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| motion requesting that the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| provide special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| And in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| that would be an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Okay, joining his motion for special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| That would be fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| He's nodding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| We're passing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| the motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| that Mr. Moncier sent to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| this last Friday since that has now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Mr. Aldrich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| the first part of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Commissioner Harmon, Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| has suggested be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| maybe a little better for us to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| the chancellor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| the governor and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| I think what he's saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I mean, we're not going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and just talk to the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| We're going to file a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I think what he's suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| is in the first part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| of his request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| he's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| combining that with the second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| because the way you approach the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| is through a written motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| which I'll be glad to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I'll be glad to join in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| and request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| special relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| that being an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| As I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| stated previously this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| I'm not real optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| So don't get your hopes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I like the idea of going directly to the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| and the judge rather than relying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| on the attorney general's opinion because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| as I recall, we're where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| because of an attorney general's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Had we had some court action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| back when, we wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| So I wholeheartedly support the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| of going to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And if the courts turn us down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| the courts turn us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| But I think we've got to exhaust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| every single remedy that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| to make sure that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| that we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| But in the meantime, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I think we need to look at changing the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Coupled with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| then I'm sure there will be an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| So it will take a much more lengthy time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Assuming the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| is stayed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There's a stay of the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| pending the appeal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| We're talking about a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| before the court for a special remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I would anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| that if that remedy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| that if our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| is rejected, that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| an appeal from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| which may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| a significant amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| if you're talking about a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| or an election that's coming up pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| We'll be on top of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| before you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Okay, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| you've handed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| I don't know how many. Is it five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Three? Four motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Mr. Monsier always sends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| things in quadruplicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Well, has this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| has any motion already been filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| that is going to be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| as what this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| These are proposed, and let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| also say they are in drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| As I'm known to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| I've worked over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| found some more authority for my positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and there's blank spots in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| but this is a general proposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| and when I were to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| with Mr. Owens and Ms. Stackhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| to hammer out the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| some of this may be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| but the principle is for the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| to order constitutional elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| The case in point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Anderson v. Celebrese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| The United States Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| has ruled, I think, directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| in point to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| I don't think that there's a heartbeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| that we can lose this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Okay, Mr. Monsier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| has there been any motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| after the jury verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| I did file a very preliminary motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| to place it before the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| and this is the more formal motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| that I had proposed to Mr. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| for him to bring to you all today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| which he has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| that I'll be happy to work with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| and Ms. Stackhouse and amend appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| to accomplish the ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| if this is your desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| to us to get to the court as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| So, Mr. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| if I heard him correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| they filed a preliminary motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| or something with the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| to do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| is going down the same road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Is that what you filed 10 days ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Right after the jury verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I filed a motion of 59.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| The court has jurisdiction for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Herb filed a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| right after the jury verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| that being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| This would be an appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| to bring this to the attention of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| and ask the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| if it can assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Mr. Harmon's wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| for this in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Okay. Has it been seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I think we might have some more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| who want to talk, but we need to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| on the call for the question now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| I think, to Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| We can object to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Or do you want to pull that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I'd just like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| if there's anybody else in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| That's why we're here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| because we've cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| All right. I'll pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Let's go ahead and get your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Okay. Let's get the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| before we go to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| I think they have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Okay. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Herb, with what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| and I'm not going to hold you to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| but what do you feel would be a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| that we would have an answer back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| We have a little bit of a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| in that the Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| is at Judicial Conference this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| and has another commitment the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| And that's going to have to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I disagree with Ms. Kleinfeld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| with regard to us having a primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| such as December the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| It would require a truncating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| of the qualifying time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And all of the people out there listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| should get their qualifying petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| in now for whenever it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| if we can get a quick election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| But it would require a truncating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| of time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| But once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| my position is that the special election law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| gives way to a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| And if I'm correct on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| then the Chancellor could set these time periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| There is an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| that I don't like as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| But the alternative would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| to go ahead and hold the primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| in February and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| hold the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| maybe 30 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| In other words, flip-flop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| If we don't get it in time for the December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| if the Chancellor did not agree with us in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| we could have a new government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| in place such as in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| There's nothing wrong at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| with this commission operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| by 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| can continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| The people of the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| are without representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| as well as equal representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| But the same is going to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| with the appointment of the replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I don't know how this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| can possibly appoint replacements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| for the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| if that violates the one-person, one-vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| No, it doesn't, Herb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I don't want to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| I digress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Well, I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| During the trial, Mr. Monsier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| you said, if I'm correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| that we didn't represent districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| We represented all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| We can do that by appointing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Chairman, I didn't know you were listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| You said it with great gist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| You know, I'm paying special attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| to the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| They don't have representation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So I'm paying special attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| And I think every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| here is representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| the 4th District because we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| they don't have representation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| So de facto, they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| because we're all representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| to answer your question more specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| we would have to confer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| with the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| as to the earliest date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| that he could hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| We have done an extensive amount of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| the state election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Mr. Thompson's arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| They're already before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| This issue, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| is well known to Chancellor Fansler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| The only major difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| that now he has this Open Meeting Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| injunctive power, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| And we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| a number of other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| that are available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| that was not available to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| in March when I just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| represented some citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| that had not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| All I can say to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| is that we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| the chancellor to hear us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| as soon as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Well, I just want to reemphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I think what some other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| had said here earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| I think we can carry on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| this business as long as it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I do not want to drag it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| but as quick as we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| But I think the body that is left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| we can still carry on business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I have every faith in the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| that are here still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Yes, question for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| actually, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I notice that you sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| I don't know, tippy-toeing around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Well, special election is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| a constitutional election, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| The only thing provided for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| in state law is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| would be to seek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| this is in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| would be to seek a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| You can then go ask the AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| you can ask any attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| except for Mr. Monsier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| and I think they're going to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| What I'm asking for is special relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| from the court to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| a, quote, election, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| The other question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| will you argue separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| from Mr. Monsier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Depends on what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Well, you don't always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| see eye to eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| But if he argues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I will certainly argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| the direction of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and the direction of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| is that the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| provide us with special relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| and that is through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| I would refer to it as a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| and that the court set the time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Now, embodied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| within that is the court's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| as well as opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| that by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Attorney General's office, perhaps the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| and perhaps our own Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| They are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I believe, duty-bound to follow the dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| of Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| So, you know, there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| opposition to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| but we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| certainly argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| the court should make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| that the court should make an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Don't get your hopes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I think maybe the consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| here is in joining with him on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| But if you're going to take a third path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| and ask for something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| should that be clarified with this amendment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| I don't believe there is a third path here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Well, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| you don't agree that it's a constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| They're all constitutional elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| If you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| I'm talking about the arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| What Mr. Monsier is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| is these 12 vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| and having an election, a quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| election, unquote, for these 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| by court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| is what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| And that's what, you know, we can pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| with Chancellor Fantzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I just think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| we let the Chancellor know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| that as a commission, as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| that we want to have an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| however that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Whether you want to call it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| constitutional election, whether you want to call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| a special constitutional election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| by any name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I think we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| here want to have an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| and we should follow every path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| And hopefully we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| and before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I give up the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| since we're all here now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| and we are running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| into some time here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Mr. Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| if you would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I think we ought to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| our committee meetings so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| hear all the issues at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I don't see any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| why for today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| intergovernmental to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| then follow that by finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| if you would like to vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| at some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| or after this special meeting is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| but I think it would be a good idea to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| our committees today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I think that's probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I haven't took account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| There may be some of these committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| that we don't even have a quorum on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I think we just have a quorum for whatever's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I think I have six left in intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and five in finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| and so I guess your quorums would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| four and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Okay, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| This is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| John, Mr. Monsier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| he's talking about declaring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| the February and August election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Is that right, Boyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| It would have been May and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Well, we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| But what I'm saying is that's basically what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Well, the Supreme Court's already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| They've already declared that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| No, the Supreme Court spoke to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| in the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| I mean, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| what we should focus on now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| is whether this court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| can grant us special relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| and that is in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| of an election instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| this body filling the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| Okay, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Mr. Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| In Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Fanzler's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| and this is just for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| curiosity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| could he have gone ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| as you have suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| or cure to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Under the pleadings as they existed at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| And the pleading that I filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| the additional day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| but that pleading has not been heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| So to answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| probably not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| under the pleadings as they existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| It was not a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| of him one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I just thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| well, again, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| challenging Chancellor Fanzler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| opinion. I agree with his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I agree with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| the way he conducted the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| But I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| about how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| body was directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| and what we were to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| when we were finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And certainly we had before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| this ominous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| task of reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Well, you saw he used the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| obiter dictum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| And what that means is, oh, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| He ruled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| however it's not binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| ruling. It's a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| by a court that we call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| obiter dictum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| when he vacated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| offices, he looked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| TCA 848| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| 1014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| correctly looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| It is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| hope that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| can suggest to Chancellor Fanzler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| that he stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| one step short. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| is looking at not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| whether there was a vacancy, but whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| or not that vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| occurred. And I disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| John on this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| As a result of an unconstitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| void election in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| I do not believe that Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| addressed that. I don't think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| What the Chancellor did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| is he declared the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| offices vacant. And he went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| further. It's not obiter dictum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| It is within his, the body of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| opinion. And it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| to be filled by the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| in accordance with Article 2, Section 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| of the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Then he cited the footnote. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| And I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| he cited the same section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| that the Supreme Court cited. And that's for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| body to fill the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| The Supreme Court, nor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Chancellor Fanzler, nor any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| other court has ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| considered whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| not the 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| elections were void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| under Comer versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Eich. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| my position that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| elections cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| valid under Comer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| versus Eich where there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| ineligible candidates on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| the ballot who could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| serve if elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| I believe that Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| law is as clear as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| my dog ate his food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| this morning on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Now, with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| to this authority concerning a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| election that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| or a new election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I have cited a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| 217-115B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| where a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| declares an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| void, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| court orders a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| new election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Not a special election, not under the special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| law, not under the election law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| They give to the people what the people were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| denied. It's as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| simple as that. The people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| 2006 were denied a valid election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| It wasn't anybody's fault at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I did everything in the world to stop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| versus prostrating myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| on a railroad tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| You know, I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| but I couldn't get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| I couldn't get it decided before the elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| and they happened. And then the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| decided it January 12th and left you all in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Mr. Monsier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| I'd just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| say that we obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| were very, very pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| at the outcome of the trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I was pleased. No, no, no. You're wrong, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| It's nothing about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I was pleased for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And given that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| and given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| still working on this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| and what to do, we appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| help, and I think I speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| for several members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| that we appreciate your suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| and your legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| because certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| we're all trying to solve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| and we want to do the will of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| and we want to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| So we appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Okay. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| I guess a couple of questions. First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| if we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| fill these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| and go into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| primary in February and then whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| we would have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| general election before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| August or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| what issues do we have if these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| are not filled? Let's say we continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| with 11 members, and let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| that the deputies continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| these offices. Are there any legal issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Oh, there are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| plenty of legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| The one that quickly comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| is the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| They are unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I don't care how you slice it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| or dice it. They are unrepresented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| because they do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| representing their interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| if it belabors the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| too long, is ripe for a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| from anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| you have a duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| and your duty under the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| is to fill vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| That is your duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| So the longer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| you go without filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| that duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I think the more ripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| a lawsuit such as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| becomes valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| How soon do you think Chancellor Fensler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| would hear this and make a ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| I don't know his calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Apparently Herb does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| He's at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| press conference this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| He's got something else going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| We can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| My response earlier was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| once we get the paper properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| filed before him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| we would ask that he try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| to make some special accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| I know this is such a public importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| that doing it what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| out of chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| is going to where he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| It's an important case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| but this case I doubt he would hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| out of chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| So that would mean that he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| have to, if we're going to hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| within the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| give us a special setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| He has been extremely responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| to this case since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| we've been in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| and my suspicion is that he will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| give us the earliest date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| that he can possibly give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Let me say one other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| that Jack McElroy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| likewise joins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and has already reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| the petitions that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| and Rick Hollow is joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| in it as well for Mr. McElroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| We took an oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| to uphold the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| the laws, and the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| and for the people who may say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| we need to just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| and get this over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| do they have some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| of a suit they could bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| against us for not fulfilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| our duties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Well, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I mean, you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| you can always go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| to a reasonable period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| You have a reasonable period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| of time in which to fulfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| your duty, your obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| and your oaths of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| There is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| who are dissatisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| with the process may file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| a suit and challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| the fact that the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| have not been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Other than the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| being unrepresented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| I think you would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| a little more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| you might have months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| of time instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| of what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| is a much shorter time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| I just think that without a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| in the 4th District that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| certainly this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| is ripe for a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| lawsuit could come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| the same people suing on this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| and they somehow didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| what they wanted and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| they come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| well, County Commission didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| do their job, Your Honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| and we need to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| with some kind of election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| because they failed to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| on their obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| I can settle that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Well, it's still the obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| My clients just waived that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Well, your clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| But we're sitting here talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I'm just trying to look at both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| we don't get down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| in a few weeks and we end up with another lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| because we didn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Well, from what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| from this conversation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| is that we're not going to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| filling the vacancies. Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Well, I'd like to maybe do a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| do exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| we can go down this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| but put like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| ten day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| we need to know something in about two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| ten days, so we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I mean, right now, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| how long this will drag out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| And if we go down this road without some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| kind of a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| then we're going to be back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| and they're going to say, well, you know, you said you'd do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| and you always said you'd do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| So I think we need to tell the people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| we're going to try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| The law director doesn't think it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We asked for it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| So I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| not leave an open door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| because we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| 1,700 employees affected by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| with their county-wide office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I mean, they've got an office holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| but still it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| stability in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| I mean, we've had three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| people running the office over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| and I think they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| But still, I think we owe it to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| that we put some kind of a deadline on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| getting the chancellor to make some kind of a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| So I would put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| if we're here on October 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| probably sometime the end of October, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| and then we could have ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| if we need to to start filling elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| filling appointments if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| What I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| had previously envisioned was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| this commission acting on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| which is a week away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| calling a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| or two to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I mean, you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| maybe at the meeting of the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| maybe a week from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| we'll have a better idea of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| our status with the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| is related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| for a special remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| If we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| going to be into November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| this body can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Our next committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| would be on the 12th of November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| regular meeting would be on the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| because we move everything up a week for November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| because of the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| So because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I don't think the chairman's mention is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| We'll be meeting at sufficient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| to keep track of the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Well, the 12th would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Track of the legal status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| The 12th would be three weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| Monsier has said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| the Chancellor's out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| pocket for a couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| and three weeks gives him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| a week, I guess, to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| and I'm sure he's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| although he's away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| I'm sure he knows what we're up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| and can at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| be studying the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| sufficient time to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I go back to what the law director said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| about the fourth district being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| represented and us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| not filling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| and at what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Now, Craig Lambert, we're going to have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| and we've got to go in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| So just hang with us so we can get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| So I do have concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| how much time do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| before someone from the fourth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| could file a lawsuit against us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| for not having any representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| we have zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Other than just appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| that come before us and they're not being represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| I think we need to exhaust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| all efforts to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| To try to have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| But at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| we may have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| we've done all we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| and we're going to have to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| and at some point we're going to have to try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| if we can't have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| how are we going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| And it doesn't look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| that on the 22nd of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| we're going to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| And it may be that we need to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| be prepared to do that in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| in case we can't have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I'm not going to say special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| I'll just say an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| It's not possible to have people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| even if, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| I guess it is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| if we did some quick appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| It's not likely that we're going to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| sitting in these chairs next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| for the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| So it's irrelevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| whether representation is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| The November meeting is on the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| and I think we need 10 days prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| so that whoever is appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| will have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| to familiarize their self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| So I feel like we have got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| until November the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| and I think that we need to give both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| pursuing their separate paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| every amount of time possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| to try to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| either a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| or a new election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| So I think that we should set the fuse on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| at November the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| That gives them every minute possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| yet still giving us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| to fill these seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| You're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| filling them on the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| No, I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| filling them on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| if a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| isn't ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| or a new election isn't ordered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| give these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| until the 9th of November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| to try to get an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| And after the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| then we go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| and we'll have 10 days to do appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| so that we have people in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| And I feel like that gives these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| every moment possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| yet still having the seats filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| if all else fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Okay, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| I don't think 10 days is long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Commissioner, I think that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| more time because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| if the fuse is November the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| and we're going to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| sitting in chairs by the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| people have to present themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| they have to be able to feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| that they have had adequate public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| I mean, the judge's ruling is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Public input is job one on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| And so if we don't have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| in by the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I think we can still conduct business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| But that may be just not enough time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| But I would also suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| that we go ahead and have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| on the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| I think we can do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| So we can already have the process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| and we know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Then that way if the special election is not held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| the process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| And then we can move on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| And the public knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| in particular those who want to seek these appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| they know exactly what the ground rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| No, no, I think between now and the 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| that those 11 of us who are sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| need to be preparing ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| in case they're not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| we can do all three at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Herb can pursue his method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| can pursue the traditional method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| We can be preparing ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| I would piggyback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| on what Commissioner Lambert said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| but put this little twist on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| And that is that I think it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| at our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| our next full meeting, the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| that we could talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| something that begins with a clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| If our efforts at achieving an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| to fill the vacancies fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| we will pursue the following method of appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| we could probably thrash out at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I think there would be near unanimity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| that we should at least bring up the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| So I don't think that presents a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| and I think we should proceed along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Need to define fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Not achieve the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Well, not achieve the ruling by the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| By Chancellor Fantzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| by the Supreme Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| by the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Okay, well, that's the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| that we work out at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| If we're going to be voting on something today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| I think we ought to work it out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| on what we're going to be voting on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| I think today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| the motion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| is that we're going to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| the state coordinator of elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Chancellor Fantzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| and asking all these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| to see if it's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| for Knox County to have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And that's the only thing we can vote on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| because it's a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| that pertains only to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| the possibility of an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Am I right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| You're right on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| but don't we want to put a day in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| so the judge will know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| We have on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| on our regular agenda, we have these topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| I'm not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I'm talking about so the judge will know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| we're expecting something back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| If he doesn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| we have a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| they may drag their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I sort of doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| they're going to drag their feet too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Well, what's wrong with putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| a date in there, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I'll give you a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I'll make it part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| I'd say the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| That gives them 15 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| whatever 15 days from today would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I'm going to stick with the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Well, then I'll have to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| The 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| No, I think it's the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| The 12th would be three weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I don't foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| I don't foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| if we can pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| having appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| at the same time just in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| we can't have an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| we can still put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| in motion possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| in case we can't have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| But I think we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| I think we need to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| at least three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| especially since the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| is going to be out of pocket for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| What about November 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Well, November the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| November the 9th would be four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Three weeks would be November 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| The 12th is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Okay, the 12th is actually four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| I just think we need to give these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| every moment possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| to try to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| an election of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| But at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| we need to be preparing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| if we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Preparing to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| is at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Yes, that's at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| What we're here about this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| is to determine if a special election can be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| and what steps can be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| to achieve that result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And I think the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| as presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| before the body accomplishes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| It just doesn't put an ending time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| that we need to have it done by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| If you want to put the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| as an ending time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I'm sorry, the 12th would actually be four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| If you want to go with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| I'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| I think that's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| I will support the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Well, the 5th would make it three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| The 5th is on a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| The 2nd is on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| So that gives the Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| the weekend to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| for the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| November the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| November the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| The 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| That would give three weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Herb, how much time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| the Chancellor is going to be gone for the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| unless he were to hear us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| especially during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| It's my intention to get with Mr. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| and Ms. Stackhouse today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| and try to hammer out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| something filed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| We can email that to the Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| He is at judicial conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| to where he can be familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| with the issues and the directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| or the vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| You know, I'm reluctant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| to give judges deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Last time I did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I got held in contempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| But, I mean, you understand what kind of situation we're in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| we want to do everything possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| to have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| We want to give you the opportunity to pursue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| but we don't want to throw ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| into another lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| with the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Well, you know, I always call it lawsuit fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| And maybe it's justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| in some circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Folks, I don't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| I was going to say members of your profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| have worked very hard to see that we have that fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Some people say we sue each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| to keep in practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| But the point of the matter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| anybody from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| bringing a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| particularly where attorney fees are not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| to force this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| to make appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| at the time that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| is voting to go to a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| to ask it to have elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| That just doesn't seem logical to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| And number two, even if they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| if the success in getting those types of lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| before the court in any timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| from my history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| is any indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| that that would happen before next spring anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Well, I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| to join with Mr. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| I think that that type of lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| would have little or no success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| where this body had voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| assuming that you do vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| According to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| that's on the floor today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I can't imagine a public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| taking a more proactive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| to a problem that's before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| than what I've heard proposed here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| and any lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Now, we really need to have folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| sitting in these chairs by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I don't think we need to have more than one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| where the whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| is represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| by half of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| well, almost half of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| what its normal legislative body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| I think it's important for our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| to have a fully filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| and I don't want to miss more than one meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| with less representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| I couldn't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| with you more, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and for the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| that I've seemed to have become a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| of a spokesperson for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| they want to elect that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| They want a valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| elected government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| and I fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| that any appointed government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| that this commission might make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| while maybe within the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| is going to be suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| in the minds of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| and number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I'm hearing an awful lot of qualified candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| make public statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| that they aren't going to seek an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| and that would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| If we gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| until the ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| to pull this rabbit out of your hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| is that giving you sufficient enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| to try what you want to try?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| And this really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| I like the concept of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| It reminds me of the space race, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| June was something unobtainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| yet you had two countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| the United States and Russia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| each pursuing with different methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| and dang if we didn't make it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| And so, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| I don't see an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| as a huge possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| but I think if you pursue your path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| and if the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| pursues his path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| we just might get lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| I think it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I think it's a no-brainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| that the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| have never elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| to these positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| and let us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I'm with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| but I want to put a fuse on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| and I think Mr. Leuthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| and our chairman wants to put a fuse on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| so that this doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| drag on forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| and I really think a goal should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| to have folks in these chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| And what I'm asking you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| if you put a fuse on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| of November the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| does that give you enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| to try what you're wanting to try?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| Yes, sir, and no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| It gives me time to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| I cannot control whether the court acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| I'll have my work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| as soon as I can join hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Mr. Hollow and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| and the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| will have our work done today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| John, do you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| that giving it until the 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| does that give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| adequate time to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| going for a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Well, it gives us time to get before the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| He'll be back in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Now, whether he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| entertains our motion within that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| that's not up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Keep in mind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| Whenever you're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| about dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| there is a statute out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| It's antiquated, but yet it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| and that's for the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| the county clerk to issue a ten-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| to commissioners for a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| to fill vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| So we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| that whatever time period it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| that you're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| that the clerk has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| sufficient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| That was back in the horse and buggy day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| but yet it is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Well, I mean, I just want us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| to proceed forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| trying for special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| and a new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| and make a good-faith effort at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| so that when we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| if we do end up having to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| these appointments that we can tell the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| we made a good-faith effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| to get elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And you should proceed, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| certainly with the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| that you are first and foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| duty-bound by the Tennessee Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| to fill these vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| That is your number one job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| In order to accomplish that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| you need to call a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| or have it at the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| But give us sufficient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| to send out the notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| to make sure the clerk has the proper notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| so that we can make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| all those preliminary steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| are timely fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| We'll be glad to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| with the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| to ask for a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| but if you get into appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| I think we're just going to be spinning our wheels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| if we're going to the appellate courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| could you get someone before we leave here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| if the date is November the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| and we've not heard anything back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| with proper notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| from the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| to have an appointment date out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| What day would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| You've got to have at least ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Ten days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| So if you do it on November the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| we don't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| They send out a notice on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| You're saying six days from the 6th or 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| What you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| at the appeal meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| you're saying for November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| I'm not sure what day that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| but for November the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| for the purpose of filling vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| if you want to fill them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| at one sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| to fill them on the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| that seems to be what you're suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| is that if we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| if we do or we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| if we do or we have an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| from the chancellery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| or if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| you can always call off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| But how do we get the special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| It would be nice to have it in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| that puts a little pressure on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| I think, all of us to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| that the court has it before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| that the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| does its best to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| and maybe gets us a written opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| So who calls the special call session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| You can call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Can we call it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| On the 22nd at your voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| And we would call it for November the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| You called it for November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| That would give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| I would think, everyone sufficient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| in order to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| you need to have some public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| some forums for candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| and you need to have a process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| to receive resumes and letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| and recommendations and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| So you just need to allow enough time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| But the 10-day requirement is a state law requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| which can be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| if we know that you're going to set it on the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| and we'll make sure that the clerk has that prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| and is sent out to commissioners by the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Mr. Monsier, would that be okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| I thought I'd heard November the 9th, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| Well, we're at November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Mr. Lambert, just hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Let us have a chance to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I mean, you know, the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| We talked about November the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| and I think that's what, is it the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| I'm still advocating for the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I'm just thrilled that you all are joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| and asking the Chancellor to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I don't think we're joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| and we're going to be doing it separate, not together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Well, nevertheless, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| November the 5th is certainly pushing the court, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| The state election coordinator would have five days to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| and then they could ask for more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| It would push it hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I would, I mean, I'm not speaking when Chancellor Fansler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| could hear us, but I think that that would really push it hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Well, are you going to file a suit trying to stop us doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| on the November, say, the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| Or is it, I'm just trying to get everybody on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| so everybody at home, everybody in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I'm going to file a suit stopping this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| to make the appointments on November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| I mean, would you be satisfied if we go down the road to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| to get a special election, which I think all of us want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| but at the end of the day, we've got, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| I have a real hard time going down this road because of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| says it is our responsibility, and I take my job seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| And trying to give away the duties, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| it kind of, I mean, I've got mixed emotions about how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| but I'm willing to go down this route to give people a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| But I'm going to, if I'm voting on it for myself personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| I'm going to put a day on there that it's going to end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| and we're going to make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| What's wrong with December doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| and giving everybody time to digest this 30 more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| I mean, I'm not trying to be part of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| but I'm not sure what the hurry is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| There's no hurry, Mr. Monsier, but we have a government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| in the fourth district that's unrepresentative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| and I think we have an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| The law says it's the legislative body's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| Now, since we're going to just discuss things, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| we have a criminal court judge right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| I mean, do you think, I mean, they're meeting over here somewhere downtown to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| I guess, a process to send to the governor or I don't know how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| for the governor to pick a new criminal court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Do you think we ought to have public hearings for the next criminal court judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| and the governor should come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I mean, this is the same issue, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| are you going to be talking to them about that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| I have devoted my energies when I'm not practicing law to the issue that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| and I'm not even familiar with what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Okay, you don't know that Judge Jenkins passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| I did know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| And you know, being an attorney, there's a process to pick a new criminal court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| And the governor is the one who gets to appoint that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| So you agree with that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Well, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| That's in Article 7, Section 5 of the Constitution, the same provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| So you don't agree with the legislative body appointing people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| That's the same provision of the Constitution, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| that provides for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| And there's another part of our statute, 217.115B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| that says a court shall order a new election where there's been a void election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| Yes, I agree that both laws should be complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| And I just want the people at home to know, too, that every criminal court judge in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| at one time, was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I think every Sessions Court judge in Knox County, with the exception of one, Mr. Cerny, were appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| Randy Nichols, the District Attorney General of this county, was appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| This isn't new, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| And, you know, we're going to ask for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| And I'll add in there the former Registrar of the District, Steve Howell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| and Criminal Court Clerk Martha Phillips have been appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| So this isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I do not in any manner, and I have never, suggested that county commission could not make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| Your question to me was, do I agree with November the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| And I think that that's an awfully tight time frame, not only for the litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| but also to have the broadest range of candidates considered and understand the rules and get before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| It just seems to me that that's awfully fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| But, now, that's your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| As far as the lawsuit, I told you I'm going to have it filed by the end of business today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Now, as quickly as I can get the court to act, I'm going to get the court to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| November 5th is pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| November 5th is pushing it awful hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| And, as I said, it's basically going to be up to Chancellor Vanzler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| I just wanted to let you know my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| And I will support something, but I'm going to put a date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I'm just curious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| I mean, I suppose I'm asking the same question, really, which is why the hurry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| because it seems to me that we're asking the court to do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| We're asking the legislature to do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Wouldn't it be better simply to, in our meeting on the 12th, our committee meetings on the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| review the progress, see where we are, see if anyone has the state legislature has come into special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| see if the Chancellor has already held a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| It would make more sense, rather than setting a firm date, that if not done by this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| we're going to just blow it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Just say where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Just look at our status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| You know, Commissioner Lambert talked about putting a fuse on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| My experience is when you put a fuse on something, it tends to blow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| So rather than blowing up the opportunity for a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| I would just say monitor the status of our efforts and look at that again on the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| rather than putting any sort of firm deadline on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| It makes a lot more sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| I think many of these arguments and suggestions are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| One that I tend to disagree with, though, pertains to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| And our body, I feel, should be giving direction to our law director distinctly of what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5698)|
| 1:35:08| And I think it's kind of diffuse a little bit for us to say, well, we'd like to pursue this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| I really would like for us to pick one thing or maybe discuss this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Mr. Moncier has presented us with a very interesting and appealing proposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| one that we have all expressed, almost all of us, I think, have heard, I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5727)|
| 1:35:34| expressed their reluctance to appoint and how difficult the appointment process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| And so we've already talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Mr. Owings has expressed how the extreme unlikelihood that a special election can be, can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5743)|
| 1:35:52| And so I would just suggest that we pursue Mr. Moncier's idea in unanimity and ask the law director to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5752)|
| 1:36:02| I do agree with the Chair's suggestion to put a time frame on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| We act at the pleasure of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| And I think that Chancellor Fansler knows the straits that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| And he's going to put us as a priority in his task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| And I think this will happen expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| And so I would just like to suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| I'd like to suggest that we act together, we speak together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| we ask our law director to pursue one avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| I am not under the notion that we need to have everything done by the next commission meeting in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| If we need to take a few extra days to make it happen, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| And I go back to the judge's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| And he has instructed us that the decisions that we make on the 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| that we do the appointment process has to be based on new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| and substantial reconsideration of the issues in which the public is afforded ample opportunity to know the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| and to be heard pertaining to the action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| So to me, that's our charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| is to make sure that for the people who are presenting themselves for appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| that they have an opportunity to present their credentials to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| that we have an opportunity to talk with them and understand where they're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| what their credentials are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| but also to give the public that ample opportunity to know the facts and to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| And so if we need to take a few extra days to comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| to me, that's the number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| Now, the Fourth District is not represented this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| People could file a lawsuit if they wanted to and say, hey, we don't have anybody here this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| But if we need to take a few extra days, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| But I do think December is the date that we should have someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Now, if it works out to where we can do it in November and we can comply with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| then I'm all in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Mr. Monsoor, when would you need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| or when do you think we would have to hear back from the court in order to do the election the way you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| I mean, because even because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| if we're talking about dragging into late November before we hear back from the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| there's no way we're going to have time to hold an election in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| At least the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| So I'm still, I mean, there's still a date out there that we have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| even under, that we have to hear back in order to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| The Supreme Court of the United States in Anderson v. Celebresi said that where the state election law mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| unduly burden the rights of the voters and the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| then the Constitution requires a court to blend together the state election law mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5946)|
| 1:39:16| and the constitutional rights of the voters in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| and the candidates to have a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| Now, to answer your question, it depends upon how many of the state election law mechanics are barred in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| For example, a general election to be held in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| State election law mechanics says that the primary election must be 45 days prior to that general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5973)|
| 1:39:41| So if you backed up from February the 5th to January the 5th, 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| that would bring you somewhere to December the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| Now, it's my position that that can be truncated if necessary to accomplish a constitutional election, but that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| Then you have to back up from the primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| I think it's 30 days, if I recall correct, for the ballot to be set by qualifying dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| and I might be wrong on that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| On the other hand, a special election, a special election that we've heard here talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| requires it to be held 75 to 80 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| So a special election, if under the state election law mechanics, could not operate within the 75 to 80 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6020)|
| 1:40:28| And you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| The closer that we get to these December dates, the less likely it is to have a primary in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| And that's why I reluctantly threw out the potential of a February primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| and then having a general election shortly after that for whatever time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| That's an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| But to answer your question is, I have not put the exact figures down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| but there's no question that the state election law mechanics would have to be truncated and shortened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| And let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| If we're successful, and we're still talking about it at the earliest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| having an elected official in February, if everything were to go well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| we're still talking a number of months that the fourth district would be not represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| and a couple other districts being underrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Would it be your opinion that we should still appoint some of these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| until the election is over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Or do you think we should leave them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| I intend to ask the court to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| I intend to ask the court to, as part of its order, for a new election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| to allow this body to continue with its 11 persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| to allow this body to continue as it is without making appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| and to let the public fill the fourth district seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| as well as the other underrepresented districts at the elections in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| if we can have them in February and the earliest date in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| So I'm going to ask the court to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| So you all don't have to have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| What was meant by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| What was meant by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| I've been in this now for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| You know, I think everybody here has just simply asked for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| And the more that the court can answer, the better off not only us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| but all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| And so I still think we need a date out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| I think, you know, I agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| As much as I'd like to have a body sat by November if we can't have an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6165)|
| 1:42:54| if need be, then December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| So I'm not as ---- I think we need a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| I don't know that we need to have the date quite that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| I'm going to still stick with the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| That allows us to maybe, if we had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| we could still come back after Thanksgiving sometime early December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| and do the appointment process if that is what's going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| So I guess part of my motion, if I can get a second to say that, well, if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6201)|
| 1:43:31| I'll tell you what, I'll go with the 9th because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| No, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Let's do this if you're okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Let's go with the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| On the 5th, we call a special called meeting to make the appointments if the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6219)|
| 1:43:48| if we have not been allowed the opportunity for some form of an election by the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| that way the adequate notice for the meeting is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| We come in on the 15th and we may hear our law director announce that we have provisions for an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| If not, we go through with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Now, as far as time goes, it's the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| We have a month until November the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| Now, if we prepare ourselves to make appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| I believe that a month is an adequate amount of time to give this substantial consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6256)|
| 1:44:23| We pursue all avenues at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| I just hate going through an appointment process while we're still trying to get an election done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| I would hate to think what these candidates, possible candidates out there thinking, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| do I want to go for the appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| They go for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6283)|
| 1:44:43| But they're trying to get the possible election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| They're contacting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Well, they contact us and at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| And at the same time, they're trying to decide whether or not they'd even want an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| because you're hearing candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| I mean, I would think it would be better to exhaust this on whether or not we have an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6299)|
| 1:45:08| and if we can't then move forward with the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| I think that if we come back, if you want to say the 9th, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| because we'll be meeting on the 12th in our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| We can say that we'll have a special meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| We could call for a day that we'll appoint sometime after Thanksgiving, probably early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6321)|
| 1:45:31| And during that time, that will give everybody plenty of time for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| to contact us and to set up some public forums so that we can hear from the people on who they would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6338)|
| 1:45:48| to represent them if that's the way it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| I just feel that there's, it doesn't make a lot of sense to try to set forward an appointment process while we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6352)|
| 1:46:01| pursuing the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| And we won't be pursuing the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| The law director will be pursuing one form of an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Herb will be pursuing another form while we're preparing ourselves to make the appointment if they're not successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| in their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| So we can pursue all three methods at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| And I think it's vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| The fourth district is not being represented right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| And I think it is vital that those folks have representation in place in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| I hate that they have to go a single meeting without representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| And I think that we have 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| We have, I mean, we have a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| We have a month to prepare ourselves to make these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| That's plenty of time to have forums and proceed with an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| But at the same time, we have the law director and Herb both trying different methods of getting us an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| You know, we need to get out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| We can pursue all three methods at the exact same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| It's actually four methods because you already have an election that is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| I mean, persons have already filed their qualification petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| So the election process is already underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| It's for February 5 and August 7 of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Mr. Trammell, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Thank you, Mr. Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Lee Trammell, 8205 Strattonwood Circle, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| I've had the honor and privilege of representing the fourth district since January 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| And I want to express to you all what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| We don't have representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| You will be voting to spend money, the fourth district's tax money, without any representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| So I urge you to go forward, try to get a special election, but at the same time have your plans ready and laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| We need representation in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| It's not right and it's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Help us in the fourth district be represented on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Thank you, Mr. Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| You know, it's not just the fourth district that's not going to be represented either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| I called it a quorum a while ago, but what I meant to say, Commissioner, is on BZA and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| we've got people that aren't even going to be able to represent their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| When a thing comes up, they need a zoning issue handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| There's nobody there to represent them, say they're against it or for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| We're losing all kinds of representation with this 11-member commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| We need to have these things set in motion to go one way or the other if we can't get the election to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| immediately on the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| It's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| It's not just the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| It's every district here is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Thank you, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| I agree with the fact that the fourth district isn't fully represented, as are some of the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| But I would also, upon knocking on probably 600 or 700 doors, I can assure you from the constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| in the fourth district that people do not want appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| I have yet to have one single person tell me, oh, please, let's have appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| What I've been told is we need an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| We were stripped of the right of having the fourth district truly represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| So I would beg you to pursue not a special election necessarily, but an election to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| Now, for candidates like myself that aren't well-known, that makes it tough on us because that means we have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| our name out there faster and with more force than those who have already known in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| But that's the fairest way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| And I implore you, please, try to get us an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| And if there's anybody else out in the audience that wants to speak, make your way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| I think that, as I stated before, I disagree that we should pursue these different avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6615)|
| 1:50:25| I think that this offer of Mr. Monsier is a very compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6625)|
| 1:50:36| And I would suggest this body pursue that vigorously and together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| and that we'd have a vote on this as soon as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| We've got a motion on the floor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Could you tell us what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| Well, Director, have you kept up with what the motions are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| But, you know, I think whatever that date is, we need to decide the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| And I certainly understand both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| But I've had people tell me we don't need to run our governments through the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| to let the courts decide how this government operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| So there's people out there on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| So we've got to get us to a point where we can go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Mr. Chairman, if I can make a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| If there's a date out there that you or any of us would like to put forward, we could make that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| and vote out on that as a separate addendum to the original motion that I have on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| And whichever date gets the six votes is the date that this commission goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| Let's do dates first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| That goes hand-in-hand with what I was going to suggest, which is to split the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| In other words, we would vote first on the provision to ask the governor, the state legislator, Chancellor Fance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| or the attorney general's office to explore any method to achieve an election to fill vacancies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| Second one, the adjoining of the lawsuit to achieve an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| And the last one being the question of a date by which we will be setting up a process of appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6724)|
| 1:52:12| It seems to me that those three issues are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| And we could split the motion and vote on each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| What's your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| What was the second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Joining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I believe the wording was to seek relief via the mechanism in the Monsier lawsuit regarding the constitutional election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6742)|
| 1:52:31| voiding, arguing for voiding of the 2006 primary and general elections for the 12 seats in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6751)|
| 1:52:42| Are you talking about joining Herb Monsier in his lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| I'm not sure of the proper legal term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Would it be filing a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| We're actually filing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Seeking relief in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| Someone can help me out on the legal wording of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Perhaps Mr. Monsier could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| What about Mr. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| I'm going to take Mr. Owens' word before he's representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I'll take either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I have attorneys to the right and left of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| So Mr. Monsier may be thinking of a lot more in terms of remedies than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| His motion to alter or amend the judgment is a bit more expressive than I wish to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| And what I am agreeable to do is to present a motion to Chancery Court for a special remedy for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6799)|
| 1:53:33| at this point in time for the court to order a special election instead of this body filling the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6813)|
| 1:53:45| See, you keep getting stuck on this word special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| That's because that's what the law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| I think the argument for a voided election and an election to follow has merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| I think the Supreme Court's already addressed that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| I want to go with the stronger wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| See, this is where we need to vote on the wording before we get to all the other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| So I would like to split the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| The first one being the asking the governor and state legislative delegation, Chancellor Fanzler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| the attorney general's office to explore any method to achieve an election to fill vacancies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| I don't know what you mean by asking Chancellor Fanzler's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| And where is this going to come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| I will delete that one from that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| I'm going to ask the governor and state AG's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| We can write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| The second point is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Let's get back to the first point, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| We've got to understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| This body writes a letter to the governor, legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| and attorney general asking to explore any method to achieve an election to fill vacancies in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6888)|
| 1:54:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| The second portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Joins the Monsier lawsuit to seek relief regarding the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6899)|
| 1:55:07| and agreeing to the voiding of the 12 offices in the primary and general election of 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| and petitioning the court for a constitutional election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| Commissioner, can I interrupt for just a second, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| I think I agree with asking the law director to file a motion asking for special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| I think there are certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I hear the law director saying that he does have some reservations about joining with Mr. Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6934)|
| 1:55:43| There might be some other legalities that he may be thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| And although I'm not sure if you've got Mr. Monsier and Mr. Hollow arguing those points for the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6948)|
| 1:55:57| and you've got our attorney asking for special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| I'm not sure if we're splitting hairs or what exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| I will modify to your wording for special relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| And the last portion of the motion is the question of a date by which this must be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| and we will then begin an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| I think those are three separate ideas, and I hope we will vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| I think we could probably get your first two in one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| I think we probably could, but if you want to merge the first two and split off the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| Let's keep them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| You want to keep them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| I guess the first thing we need, we also need to, let's take care of the date first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| That makes it determine how I vote on the second and first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| I'm going to make the motion of the 12th of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7009)|
| 1:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| What would we do on the 12th of November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| That's the date that we need to have heard back from the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| And if we have not heard back by the court or some other higher authority that we can hold a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7023)|
| 1:57:11| then we should at that time be prepared to go down the process of an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7031)|
| 1:57:20| That's the committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| That is the committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| So you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| What I'm going to do is at this time is that we have a special meeting in between our committee meetings on the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7044)|
| 1:57:35| that we will set forth the appointing, the process of going through the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7055)|
| 1:57:44| I consider that all a friendly amendment to my motion to divide, if not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| So you're seconding the 12th as a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| I will go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| You're talking about on the 12th and we're going to come up with what date we're going to make the appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| We will come up with the entire process on the 12th if we have not heard back from the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| I thought we had it on our agenda to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| Well, we've sort of got to this point with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| It's sort of wrapped into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| And although we have it on our regular agenda, we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| The agenda item that I had was sort of an all-encompassing type of motion or resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7104)|
| 1:58:33| And, you know, this is sort of what I had in mind for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| So you're asking for the special relief to be accomplished by November the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| And if not by that date, on the 12th we will then lay out our plans on how we will go through the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7124)|
| 1:58:53| I won't say we won't have to, but if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| Commissioner Lamb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| Why can't we pursue both at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| I mean, I don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| I mean, while the attorneys are trying to get us a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| I don't understand why we can't go ahead and start going through a process to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| I don't see why we have to push this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| And what I'm getting at is I want the 4th District to be represented by the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| And I would like to see that too, but I just feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| I mean, we can do that if we pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| And I agree with you, Mr. Lambert, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Other than the fact that I think that the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| and I believe a great majority of the people of the 4th District would prefer to have a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7178)|
| 1:59:48| even if that meant that they were not represented for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| That's just my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| But we can pursue both of these at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| While the attorneys are pursuing an election and a special election, we can be preparing for the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| And I don't understand why we're stuck on that of we can't do anything until the courts have ruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| We can do everything but make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| We can prepare ourselves to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| We can hold public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| We can meet with candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| We can view their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| We can do everything but make the appointments right up until the day that the judges rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7223)|
| 2:00:32| And I just don't understand why we can't pursue both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| Now, I know it's a little more work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| but I think that it's important that we have a goal that we get representation in place by the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| And I understand and I would love to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| Unfortunately, I just, in my opinion, okay, just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| I don't think it's fair to the candidates that would be trying to decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| or not they'd want the appointment or not when we're still trying to pursue an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| Well, the candidates can pursue both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| They can pursue an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| In fact, it's very similar because an appointment process is an election with 11 voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| They can pursue the appointments, and at the same time, they can be pursuing an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7281)|
| 2:01:28| And you're welcome to vote on this however you feel, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| I just, that's how I feel that we should pursue the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| Well, I mean, the motion on the floor is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| The motion on the floor is that we come back on the 12th if we've not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| if we can't go forward with an election, that at that time we set forth the process of going through the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| We've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| We've talked about this for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| Well, and we can't talk about this outside of this venue, so these meetings are going to last a whole lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| Because I'm not going to vote until I'm ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| Guys, we're going to take a vote on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| It takes eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| If you're ready to end discussion, vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| If you want to talk, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| No, we can't discuss anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| So we'll try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| If you want to cut off debate, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Chair is going to rule no wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7388)|
| 2:03:17| Okay, we had four ayes and seven noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| So we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| No, we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Commissioner Hammond has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| I want to support Commissioner Lutho's notion that we do the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| I'm in agreement that we can go ahead and work on a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| and I think we can have the plan in place so that the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| we can come in and say this is the plan and this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| But for us to go through a procedure of asking candidates to come out to forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7424)|
| 2:03:50| and asking the public to come to forums and go through this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| and then all of a sudden we come in and say, oops, we're sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| none of this is working now because we can have a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| I just don't know that we need to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| But I do agree that we should have our process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| and we know how we're going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| Again, I've had no one, no one say that they want an appointment process except for the politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| Now, the people obviously want an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| and I agree that the folks in the fourth district want an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| and I believe that the folks all across Knox County want an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| And if we can do that, that's what we ought to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| But in the meantime, yes, let's look at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| But as far as the 12th, let's meet on the 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| and we can set a date then and have the plan ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| I believe that we need to pursue an election through any means necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| And we have two good methods at trying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| But I don't believe that in the process we have a duty, if they're not successful in getting us some form of an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7487)|
| 2:04:56| we have a constitutional duty to make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| And I believe that while we're pursuing an election, at the very same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| we need to be preparing ourselves to make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| And I believe that we can pursue them both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| And I believe that for the candidates, what's the difference in a forum for the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7512)|
| 2:05:19| And I had a couple of debates when, you know, before my election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| What's the difference in a forum for the voters and a forum for the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| There is no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| They're one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| So while these candidates are making speeches to us, they're also making speeches to the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7531)|
| 2:05:39| We can do both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| That way, we can be pursuing a special election, giving a special election an adequate amount of time, yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7542)|
| 2:05:50| at the same time, we're preparing to do our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I've got one thing to see if we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| I'd like to have us where we can tell the people, so they know today, across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| that if we do not have heard something positive or heard anything from the quarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| that we meet on the 12th, and we already have a process laid out on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| I mean, we'll have from now to the 12th to get a process through this commission laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| And then we can have it out, and they can do polls on Channel 6, 10, whatever, to see if the people like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| And that process, we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| But on the 12th, meet and come up with the public hearings or the debates or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7591)|
| 2:06:38| and how many of those we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| But I think today, we also ought to say 10 days from the 12th to the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| I mean, we need to have it worked out today to move forward, because there's some people on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| that will stonewall getting to that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| Well, we can come in on Thanksgiving, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| You can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7621)|
| 2:07:02| I don't know when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Has anybody got a calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| I don't know if that Thursday is Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| The fourth Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071015special?start=7628)|
