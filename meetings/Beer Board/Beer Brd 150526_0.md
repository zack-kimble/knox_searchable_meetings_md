| 0:05:20| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning from MPC, and the surrender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=320)|

| 0:05:59| Cold fusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| This requires a taste test, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=361)|

| 0:06:43| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| I believe that for manufacturing, if it's just manufacturing, I don't think there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| a distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| There's no service on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=409)|

| 0:07:10| Oh, it's just a small production pilot brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=430)|

| 0:07:48| Ms. Dyer, do you have some information for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| We need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals, and a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=470)|

| 0:07:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| And it's just a matter of getting the paperwork done after those inspections, which you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| do until you get everything installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=487)|

| 0:08:25| We had a chocolate chili beer, all kinds of stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| And we'll do some English styles as well, good easy drinking stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=508)|

| 0:09:59| Sadiq Panjwani, Green Grocery, 1822 East Mignolet Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=604)|

| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| So we did get the missing application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| And this is in the 6th District again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| I have a question on the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| It's listed as Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Johnnigan's is closer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| But it's still 300 feet away, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Yes, but isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| This is a current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| Yeah, Johnnigan's would be 300 feet away, but I believe it is closer, geographically speaking, than Berry's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| In fact, I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| And we frequently have people who put the wrong hospital or the wrong church or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I think they also have the wrong church as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Arlington Church on Tacoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| And actually, my own church is closer to this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| But you're 300 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| They need to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| But I move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=668)|

| 0:11:36| Ryan Cox, 1836 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Mr. Cox does have a conviction in city court for the annual alcohol education training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| He was convicted on April 26th of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Mr. Frost, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Under 4-37A of the city ordinances, it specifically says no permittee shall be a person who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=717)|
| 0:12:06| been convicted of any violation of any ordinance related to the possession, sale, manufacture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| transportation, or beer, and it goes on about some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| In the past, I've discussed this type of violation with the law department, and they, too, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| of the opinion that this would not be a proper person to hold a permit under the city ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I had the citation pulled, and I did bring it to a lawyer, and we are trying to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| It was a – when I received the citation, I wasn't on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Rafik Hanna was, so it was a citation for not showing up to the task class for – he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| skipped two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| So he immediately went and took care of it, and so the restaurant was fine, but I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| know that if I paid the ticket that I would be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I would suggest that we defer this to the June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| That will give you and your lawyer time to get everything straightened out, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| come back and see us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Yeah, could I just ask – I understood you to say that it was the prior owner's offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| and not yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| In other words, you were not involved in the failure to do the education or whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| was that was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| I actually did take the class that year for my own ABC permit, but when they came in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| give Rafik the citation, he wasn't present and I was, so my name got put on the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| But you have evidence that you took the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| We're working on getting Rafik's evidence that he took the class that year, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Will 30 days be enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Yeah, it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| So do I have a motion to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=829)|

| 0:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I think we need a motion to approve their withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=845)|

| 0:14:50| We haven't taken the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Does that mean we should defer it to another date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Is that correct, Sergeant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Well, let's give them an opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And then if they're not here, we'll defer it and send them another letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=904)|

| 0:15:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Do we need to vote to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Do we need a motion to defer to the hill of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=913)|

| 0:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| It seems like the other owners didn't want to spend no money to put nothing into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| so we're trying to spruce it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Make it a neighborhood bar and grill where everybody wants to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=949)|

| 0:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Do you want to tell us about Bob Dylan's return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| We are having our 11th annual Bob Dylan birthday bash on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| Free admission to the music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| As always, we're having lots of live local musicians that are all covering Bob Dylan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| songs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Fun to be had by all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| And again, the date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Friday, June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Very close then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| We will go through the addendum and then go back and see if those people have shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Bar Marley on Stone Street emailed today that they would like another deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| They first applied in November of 2014, and they have been granted extensions, extensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| and extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And so we need to know tonight, are we going to extend them another time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| What's the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Well, this time he said he was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Bar Marley is on a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| He purchased the property from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| It has a problem with the soil being toxic, and he knew that he had to get that remediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| before he built his building or set up his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| And so far he hasn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| So the building inspector isn't going to approve anything operational there until that issue is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| So we have two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| We can extend this again until June the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| We can have a no motion on the extension, which would mean the application would die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| When was the original application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| November 25th, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| I'll vote to extend one last time, and then we deep stick it if he hasn't got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So the motion on the floor is to extend a final time to June 23rd, and if he isn't ready, then it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I think it makes more sense just to have a motion postponed, not with an automatic death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| It's not a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| It's an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| He was approved pending final documentation, and there's one piece of the puzzle he hasn't obtained yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1405)|
| 0:23:34| So the motion needs to be, if you're going to do it, to extend it until the June beer board meeting, not postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1414)|
| 0:23:43| Right, but I don't want to tie our hands in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| This motion sounds like we wouldn't have the opportunity to extend it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| I heard the word postpone, which is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| So I don't have a dog on the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I'd like to make sure my motion is amended to extend it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| To June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Yes, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Well, the only issue I have with it is that you don't know what's happened in this gentleman's life in the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| and we've already seen one tonight that was postponed because of a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| And over six months, six, seven months, I mean, you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, I think there's a certain time where the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| he's still trying to get the beer permit and the building permit and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| but then there's another aspect of it in his background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So at some point, you know, they have to come back for a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Is that the way to handle that, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Typically, they're only required to go through the background check for a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| So once they've been through that process and been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| they're not rechecked unless they submit another application for either another business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| But we never know whether they're, nothing would alert us that if something had happened over the last six or seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| in this case, it wouldn't alert us without redoing the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Typically, no. You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| You're saying the duration is what's allowing things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Allowing things to happen that we may not know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| But you still know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| I mean, is it possible to do a background check without going back through the entire application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| That's the only part that's a little bit, you know, that's questionable, that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Maybe it's not likely. Maybe it's not probable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| But, I mean, we've essentially postponed or denied one tonight because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| So, I mean, I think it's, and maybe this is something we need to take up in an administrative meeting in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| but to decide on what, you know, what is allowable and how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| or can you just, you know, re-up the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Okay. Let me clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| We have approved this application pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| and his final documentation is getting the building inspector's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| The building inspector is not going to approve until the soil is remediated from the toxic site that was formerly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1558)|
| 0:26:08| So, we have already approved his application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| but this keeps circling around to us because he hasn't finished the final piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Well, then I'm going to vote to deny it so that he's got to come back through and start the application again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| so we can get a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| He covered my thought exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| I mean, that's what we can do is just not approve it, and then they have to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| Okay. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Can you put up a sign saying, don't eat the dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| I mean, this gentleman is trying to open an establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| and he's dealing with a tough piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I mean, why does this body want to present another hurdle to this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| I mean, to me, I just, for us, it's so easy to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| I just don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| So, I'll be voting in favor of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Which motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| The motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Okay. I think we have two motions on the floor right now, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| We have one motion to, yes, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Could we ask the applicant to appear and explain what in the world is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| We have done that, and he chooses to not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| But he did ask you to postpone it, or to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Was it email or a phone call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| An email asking to postpone, he was going to be out of town tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Well, the risk is that there's criminal activity that you don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| That's the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I mean, yeah, and you approve it, and you, I mean, it's pretty clear what the risk is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| that you've approved and that you will continue to approve a file that there could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I mean, I don't know the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I don't know anything about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| But six, seven months goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I mean, a lot can happen, and you just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| The same thing, I mean, he could be operating and the same thing could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I mean, what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Pretty big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Something could have happened in the last seven months that has transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| But if an owner commits one of these crimes, do we pull their beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| I'm sorry, what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| If an owner commits one of these crimes that would prevent a permit being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| do we pull their permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| We actually file a noncompliance complaint to make that happen, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| So if that happened in this case, would that occur or not occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| If he was granted the permit and he began operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and he received a conviction for an ordinance or statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| that deals with the sale, distribution, or possession of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| then yes, when we receive notification of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| then we would get together with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| and file a noncompliance complaint to take the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| So in this instance, would this process of extending his permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| would that affect that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| No, we would still follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| If it was extended and we found out that he received a conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| then we would probably check with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| I mean, normally we would follow that same process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| but obviously it's been approved but he hasn't received it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| so that's something I don't think we've encountered yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| But a flag still would be raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| If he gets a conviction under the state unless somebody notifies us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| we wouldn't necessarily know that there was a conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| unless he came in for another background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| which there's no procedure in place right now for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| There is an ordinance under, I believe, Chapter 4 that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| if he receives a conviction for one of the alcohol ordinances in city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| city court is supposed to let the beer board know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| So we typically do find out if there's a conviction in city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| but if there's a conviction in any other jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| we don't always know unless somebody links it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I tend to agree with Councilman Wallace here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| I mean, I beat that drum as loud as anybody about putting up obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| for businesses to get up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| But after six months, I think he's had ample opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| and I think he should have sent, you know, if he's got to be out of town, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| We've got a bunch of good attorneys in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| to where they could have hired an attorney or someone to come represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| and at least tell this board if it's that important as to what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| But yet we're left in limbo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| not only being able to talk to the new owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| but the six months, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| I think that's something we probably should look at from an administrative standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| because it certainly leaves a gray area at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| So I'm not going to support, you know, moving forward with this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| just on those two things alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Those are major things to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and perhaps we can look at that down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Maybe we put a limit on how many times this can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| I'm going to amend my motion because I still think that since no one knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| that we had some six-month rule in the back of our mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| I'm going to move that we extend it for the 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| and require as a condition that he appear at that meeting to explain all matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| And if that doesn't work, we deny the permit at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Is that an amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Then I'll second that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Vice Chair Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| You know, I've got to ask Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I mean, I don't think we can make anybody come to this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| You know, come, we ain't extending it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Well, I understand that, but I don't know that that would be a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Well, they really should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| I'll concede that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| But, you know, show up or, you know, you get denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| I'm not terribly comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Or you wouldn't be getting denied, you wouldn't be getting extended, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| And the effect of it is you've got to start over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| I still think that's fairer than invoking some rational six-month rule that no one knows about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| And I think that we have to change our procedures and do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| I think we ought to give this guy a chance to show up and explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and if he doesn't, it's the end of his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I mean, I think a proper motion would be to extend, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| however many days the beer board decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And then if he doesn't show up, then you can act at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| because there might be some extenuating circumstances that I can't think of, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| So, you know, maybe there's a motion to extend it X number of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| and if folks don't agree with that, then maybe they vote against that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Could you tell us the motion that is currently on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Because we've had several floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Are you withdrawing your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Well, advised by council, it's just a motion to extend for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| For 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| And we'll deal with it for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| For June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| June 23rd, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| That's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| We can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| We can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Make it voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| We're done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| The amended motion is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| This is the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| So we are voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Vice Mayor, I mean, Councilman Della Vopi, do you have anything else, or is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| That's the old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| If I understand correctly, the motion is to extend this to June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Sounds like three no's to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Five, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Five, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| So Bar Marley will be here on June 23rd, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| For more entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| The second addendum is Whiskey Bent Bar and Dance Club on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Would you name an address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Josh Wires, 4328 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| You need to get your file complete with a building fire and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Is that done yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| No, we're still lacking those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| You applied in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| This is now May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| How close are you to being ready for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We're about 40, 45 days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| If we extended this to July 21st, would that give you time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| July 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Yes, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| This is in the 4th District, Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| I'm going to move that we defer this until July 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| The next one is an old city special event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| and I don't think we've had any of these on the agenda since most of us have been on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Possibly Vice Mayor Pavlis might be aware of that, but the rest of us aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| This is Smoky Mountain Rumble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| and we have some folks here who look like they're either going to rumble or tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| What we have to do is just have this read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| We don't vote or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| We just listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| So if you give us your name and address and tell us about your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| It's Dwayne Carleo, 106 South Central Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Basically, this event is sponsored by U.S. Rider News, Visit Knoxville, and Harley-Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| It's a motorcycle rally similar to what the Honda Who did about ten years ago in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| We're planning on shutting down the streets from Willow Street down to Jackson up to the old city courtyard entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| Food vendors, clothing vendors, basically create a festival atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| and it's been approved by the Historical City Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| And what are the dates on this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Friday, July 10th, and Saturday, July 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| About how many people do you think will be at this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| A couple thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| The application says July 12th, 10th to the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Is there three days or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Oh, a Sunday for cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| That's 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| But we won't be selling beer on that Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, Mr. Frost wants to explain this oddity for the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| The last time that anyone can remember something like this happen was also for a motorcycle event, the Honda Who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| and the Honda Who hasn't existed for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| This comes under 4-76D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| and they have to simply go through all the steps and present their information to the chair of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| with a copy to the city recorder of the intent to conduct this special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| I mean, because it's been years and years and years since this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I've worked with Wanda and Rick Emmett and Sergeant Hunter and the beer board chair about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| trying to get this all taken care of and discussed it with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| It is kind of odd that there's not really a normal vote like the beer board traditionally has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2239)|
| 0:37:29| How is it different than a special event application like we just approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Well, truth be told, there isn't really a form for this type of event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| I want to say last time it was eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| It doesn't mean that we're not working on a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| It just means that Mr. Carleo has come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| and you've really done a great job getting all the things together and going through all the hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| So if there are no further questions, we wish you good luck with this and a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| All right, we have two administrative hearings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| The first one is Hilton Garden Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I haven't forgotten about the two other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| The first one is the Hilton Garden Inn, 216 Peregrine Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| They have two citations, 623.13 and 421.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Fred Bullard, 216 Peregrine Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| What have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| You also will be coming back to the VIER Board next month because you have a TABC citation that you have addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| We didn't get it until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We have to have 14 days to notify you and 14 days to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| We've already dealt with TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| So there's really not anything we can do with that, but this is what I would like to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| And I hope the VIER Board goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| The first plan that you submitted after the 2013 violation obviously had some loopholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| and the new one isn't as strong as I'd like it to be or as this VIER Board would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| Well, the person was carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| It's not that we didn't card anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| We did card them, and it's like the officer told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| He says, you know, it happens all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| They get hung up on the date and they misfigure it, and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| The young lady is not a regular bartender for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| She stepped in that night because of sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| She did what we had trained her to do, what we had sent through the ABC class for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| She did card it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| She just didn't figure it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| So that's why I've had this system or application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| Mike Gross did this for me for our system because there was nothing for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| similar to what the grocery stores do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| So that's the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| We have the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| We have the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| We've trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| We send people in once a month to test them, and we've had no problems up until this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| But that one night was the bad time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And the person that the manager was running the room service just wasn't there to help the lady out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| That's all it was to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Do they post the date on the register or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| This one now will post the date and also allow you to input the license date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| and it will tell you for sure that it's whether or not it is a legal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| It is already in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| It wasn't supposed to be done until the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| They got it done on the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| It's already in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| What I would like to suggest is that we have you come back next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| and we'll address both of these things at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| because we have to address the TABC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| So you submitted your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| You've paid your fine, which you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| But we also, next month, after you've gotten all the legal notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| need to decide if we're going to accept the TABC penalty and no further action on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| and we'll never see you again for a third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I'm retiring if it happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| I should have done it in December and let them talk me out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| Well, your successor we don't want to see either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| In other words, we would deal with all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I thought that's what would happen because I hadn't heard from anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| but I came because I was summoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Councilman Delavauping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Do we have any relations with the school system where they could add or subtract 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| to get these kids ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| You would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| The county commission handles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| We need to, I will move that we postpone this to June 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| So we will see you on June 23rd because I'm sure you're not going to be retired yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| 35 years in this business may be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| It's probably enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Anyway, we'll see you on June 23rd then, and we'll take care of all these at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| The next one is Carrabba's Italian Grill on North Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| and their first violation was on January 16th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| and their second violation was on April 21st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| They have submitted an updated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| They have also paid their fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| They have a TABC suspension for 10 days, and I think you're observing that right now, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| Actually 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| And so tell us a little bit about how this is not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Well, again, as the last gentleman just said, I had two different people, both of college age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| both did ID the guests because, again, that's something that we're really diligent about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| They just both got the dates wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I know that's really not anything other to say other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| other than at this point we are having to drill in everybody's head on a daily basis what the actual date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| As he just said just a minute ago, I mean, we can't make them do math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| but hopefully we can get them to remember the actual date that has to be before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Again, we're doing it in multiple different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| We've gotten the ID coders to put over the license, the information directly to their eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| Any license that has a red stripping beside the picture that has the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| they're actually having to bring it to a manager, no questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Even if it is over that date, they're still going to bring it to us to where we can physically approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| We're, again, putting signage up just about everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Every single day, every one of our servers have to come in before they can start their shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| and basically have to recite to us what the born on date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| We go through the processes with them again about what to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Again, the red stripping information, making sure that they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| It's something that there's not even a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They bring it to us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Now, this is another situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| We got the TABC notice in time for them to be made aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| So what we're doing tonight is looking at our ordinance and also the TABC piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| They've paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| They've submitted a revised plan, and they have a 15-day suspension from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| Did you have to pay a fine to them also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I'm not sure whether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I know we directed the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| I think it was directed to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I don't think that they had us pay a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Okay, but 15 days is 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| It's a pretty big fine already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Again, we're eight days in at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| It's been a good wakening call, obviously, for everybody in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I'm sure it is for everybody that's dealing with it in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| $1,500 was the fine you paid to TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| So they got a 15-day suspension and $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| They paid a fine to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Now, this is the question the Sphere Board has to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| We can accept all of this, and this is the end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and we will never see Carabas in front of us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| If we do, they automatically go to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Our second option is that they've done all these things, got the suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| paid the fine, and we can send them to the hearing officer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| I would like to move that we accept the TABC penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| the things that they've paid and done, and that this would be the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| and we will never see Carabas in front of us again unless there's an ownership change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| If that's a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150526?start=2739)|
