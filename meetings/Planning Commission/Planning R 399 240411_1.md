| 1:41:16| That goes to Michael's Farm, which is on down Pickett's Gap, which that's the way the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| travels, and with that being said, now you can drive down through there and that creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| is, and when it rains heavily, is 12 to 14 foot wide, as it is now, and the water rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| up and floods the fields, but when you look at the house that's built on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| it's probably about 758, probably close to a million dollar home that's there, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| on the corner of Pickett's Gap and Tarkland Valley, there is also a couple of new houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| that are there, and they are in the price range of about five to six hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| dollars each, and my understanding is there are going to be a couple more built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| So I'm not totally against development by any means, I've made my living, I'm a subcontractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| and I've worked for a lot of builders and I've worked down west and I've seen all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| Thirty seconds, Mr. Spelser, if you could wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Thirty seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| But the point being is that I understand what the development is about and it's for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| people to find a place to live, but what I'm getting at is that when you look at this here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6140)|
| 1:42:28| and the plans that they have, and there's a D.R. Horton style house that is my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6148)|
| 1:42:36| that we are looking at, and it does not fit the neighborhood, you know, if they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| put houses in according to what's on the property, or let's change it to agriculture, one house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| per acre, then that's something that we could all probably, we will have to live with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| either way it goes, but I would like to see it one house per acre and preserve as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6174)|
| 1:43:02| of it as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Next is Mr. Maroney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Committee, thank you for the time that you guys actually take to do all of this and listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| to both sides of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| My name is Darren Maroney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| I live at 704 Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| It's the old white farmhouse from the dairy that used to encompass this entire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| and about another 500 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| My wife and I bought it about a year, just shy of a year ago, thinking we made it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6216)|
| 1:43:36| We got out to a place where our daughter can run through the woods, no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Needless to say, we were kicked back on our heels a little bit two weeks ago when we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| a notice saying that there's a planned residential development that wants to come into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6225)|
| 1:43:53| Eighty-four acres, 168 units is what they requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| The planning staff, I think, came back in a good way at one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6238)|
| 1:44:07| Even with that, it will change the character of the rural space that is so critical to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| the county of Knoxville and the city of Knoxville, why people move to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| Parkland Valley, McCammon Valley, all that area, if it gets developed, you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| lose why people come here and why they want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| I'm not for a fast food housing development, something that's going to be falling apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| I am a general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I am a remodeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| I know what these houses do in a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| If we're going to prove something like this, we would love to see something of a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| quality that comes into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| But Pickens Gap is a tight area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| People get hit almost on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Coming down out of Greasy Hollow, if you know where that is, it's right there in Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| It's scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I've been in the ditch in my truck before because of the amount of people coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| If we have 1,500 new cars weekly coming through there, you're going to have some wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| Coming off of Highland View onto Chapman Highway, taking a left, someone's going to get injured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Running up Pickens Gap up to Parkland Valley and going out Parkland Valley towards Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| it's a one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| We already know that Pickens Gap and Parkland Valley is Motorhead Speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| It's been that way since the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| It's fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| It's entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| You add an extra 1,500 trips a day, someone's going to get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| So the clustering that is proposed for this does not fit the rural character of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6343)|
| 1:45:53| If you pack 168 houses in 40 acres, I moved out to the country to be in the country, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6353)|
| 1:46:01| in the urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| So we'd ask you to please keep it at least at one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you, Mr. Maroney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| There's approximately 600 people signed the petition against this that I'll submit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Ms. Jennifer Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Hi, thank you for hearing my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| My name is Jennifer Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I live at 8217 Pickens Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| My husband and I have lived there for almost 25 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| Even though I'm a lawyer, I'm here as a resident of the area and really don't have any experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| in the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| This is the first time I've done something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| I don't normally oppose development, but this area, I agree with Mr. Maroney on some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| and we did not coordinate necessarily what we were going to say, and I'll try not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| be redundant and reiterate some of his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| But I'm asking the commission to deny the application or at least postpone any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| on the rezoning application, primarily for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| Before I address those in a little more detail, I want to thank and appreciate the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| Mr. Reynolds did in recommending only one unit per acre instead of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| But that, given the hillside set-aside, that still crams in over 80 homes in a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6447)|
| 1:47:36| acreage space, and so we believe that is still too many for the character of that rural agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| So the parcel itself is isolated and disconnected from the development that's on Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| In fact, on Pickens Gap, you can't even really see that development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| When you drive up and down Pickens Gap, it is a rural area that is not attached to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| other developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| And so now, what we're hoping is that now that Knox County has invested in the advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| Knox plan, that new housing developments will be consistent with that plan, because thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| development does benefit all of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| The proposed development here conflicts with that advanced Knox plan, and our county leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| our taxpayers, and the commission here are committed to developing a plan that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| benefit all Knox County residents with a data-driven strategy for future growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| And I know that it probably won't pass until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| It should pass tonight, and it should later most likely be confirmed by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| But we ask that the commission not disregard this massive effort that's consumed almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| two years and $1.2 million taxpayer dollars invested into research and input from experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| and the public to establish guidelines for future growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| And one of the main purposes that this was done was so that as our population escalates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| tremendously, that it won't lead to sprawling subdivisions that are eating up valuable green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| space and farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| People move to South Knox County from all over the country because it is a very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| beautiful farmland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| We have the urban wilderness, we have bicyclists, outdoor enthusiasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| It is why my husband and I were attracted to South Knox County out of everywhere when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| we moved to Tennessee 40 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| If you could just summarize here, we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I want to also reiterate that the safety issues are real, and I do not believe that Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| addressed those adequately in the agenda review meeting yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| When you pull out of this proposed subdivision and turn left, you go into Pickens Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| Pickens Gap is a gap, very steep slopes on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| The road gets very narrow, windy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| I think Mr. Reynolds showed 18-foot across in some areas, but it actually gets more narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| You have to go down to a crawl and almost fall off the side of the road to pass anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| through that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| We do have considerable concerns, not only with that gap area, but also accessing Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6623)|

| 1:50:57| Eugene Smith, I signed up on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6657)|
| 1:51:08| Okay, all right, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| My name is Eugene Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| I live at 8328 Pickens Gap Road on a 140-acre family farm, which has been in my family since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6675)|
| 1:51:23| 1959.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| So we're relative newcomers to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| And the issue is that every time there's an attempt to build more houses in the back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| the zone that we're talking about, they will have to run all the utilities down Pickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6696)|

| 1:51:52| in sewer lines, electric lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| There's nothing back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| That's a one-lane road that the current resident lives on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| And the question in front of your committee is, who's coming to Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| The lady who built on that property bought 80 acres and put a $2.5 million home on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| because she thought it was a treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| We in our area think our area is a treasure that should be preserved, and we need your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6735)|

| 1:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Well, I am actually a newcomer to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| I am that C word, the Californian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| And I know, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| But actually, I grew up in rural part of California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| I grew up in orchards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| My husband grew up in vineyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| We grew up where we were literally picking fruit off the trees, eating it, making mud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| pies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| We really lived the rural lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| But as the decades went on, our towns decided to continue to, under the guise of affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| housing and more housing, to fill in those orchards and those fields and the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| I had neighbors with pigs and sheep and chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| All those animals now are no longer allowed in my old town in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| And we moved to this area specifically to have a rural experience for our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| the one that we had as young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| And to see people come in, buy parcels of land at a very reasonable cost to them, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6819)|
| 1:53:47| then develop into these smashed up little bits of land, all these homes you can practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6827)|
| 1:53:55| touch the people next to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| That is California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Do not California my Tennessee, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| This is really important that all those decades that I lived there, that we did not fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6843)|
| 1:54:11| enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| And I see this happening here, becoming the new little California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| And you need to understand that preserving your agricultural lands, whether for wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| for enjoyment, just for the view, for the Sunday drive, please consider preserving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6863)|

| 1:54:32| I am not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| I am not against more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| But don't try to tell me this is going to be affordable housing for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| I can guarantee these homes are going to be $400,000 and $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| You will need over $120,000 a year to afford those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| I don't know a lot of my local neighbors who make that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| And I think that you need to look at the intent of the person buying it from this couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| They are just about making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| And I understand everyone wants to make money, but I don't want it at the cost of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| my children, and my children's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=6907)|

| 1:58:45| My grandparents and my great-grandparents and my great-great-grandparents lived in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| their whole lives too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| This has always been an affordable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| It's why people choose to come here and choose to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| They don't come here only to live in the rural parts, although, again, I totally understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| that this particular part of the county, that's the purpose, and I'm with you on your safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| concerns and all that, but I want you to know that the price of a house to the ratio to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| the income is worse than it was during the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| My generation cannot buy a home here, so if you want to preserve Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| it's about the people that stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| It's about the Knoxvillians that are kind, that care about each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| So don't sit here and come from California and wherever the hell else you're from and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| tell me that housing affordability is not a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| Okay, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7174)|
| 1:59:40| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| I have a question for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Hi, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| They're saying, and I haven't driven this road in years, but they're saying that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| goes down to like a one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Has there been a traffic study done over there to see, or does that come like with a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| That'll come with a concept plan to identify any road improvements that may be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| to go along with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Okay, and then I have one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| So currently there looks to be like a newer, large, very large house sitting right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| which is smack in the middle of the property, and this is probably premature too, but your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| plans to build similar homes to that or something completely different and then that one will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| just hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| So we don't have a specific plan for the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| What we're obviously asking for is the rezoning to be able to delve into whether it is feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| to do that, something like that here, but there is no specific plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| I just figured it was premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| I just wanted to ask anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| One thing that I did forget to mention, we met with some of the neighbors yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| Mr. Shuler, I'm sorry, but the order of the meeting is such that we're at commission level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| If someone has a specific question, we will get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| Can you speak to the comment that one of the opposition referenced that everything would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7263)|
| 2:01:11| have to be brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| You said that everything's already there, meaning electric, sewer, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| So the water is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| The sewer is about 600 feet away from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| Knox Chapman installed it in 2019 as part of a basin plan for this whole entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| There's an eight inch line that runs from Highland View Road all the way to the High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| Bluff Pump Station about two and a half miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| And the utilities are available to be tapped into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| Can I ask engineering then just to verify the opposition comment that Stock Creek was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| going to be torn up, that there was a lot of damage that was going to be done by bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| these in, but it sounds like the utilities are already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| That's something we wouldn't know until we get to the concept stage, but I take what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| he's saying for his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| Any work in the stream to be regulated by TDEX would require ARAPS, and they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| to remediate the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| There wouldn't be damage to the stream without TDEX overseeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7335)|
| 2:02:24| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| I'd like to make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| classification per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| We have a motion by Commissioner Schelso to approve the sector plan amendment to rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| residential per staff recommendation, seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| We still have, we still, we had some lights, but we don't, and I will add, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7370)|
| 2:02:58| density conversation will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Would you all like to hold your conversations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Are you on it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| I was just going to make a comment before the motion was made, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| We'll give it to you now if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Commissioner Huber, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Yeah, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Well, I guess one thing I wanted to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| You had mentioned, Mr. Shuler, that you had met with a few neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| We met with Mr. Schelso and Mr. Moran yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| And how'd that conversation go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| It went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| They, you know, we talked about the current density versus the new density that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| proposing and they asked, you know, about adding some additional, you know, some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| estate size lots in the back, which we hope to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| And I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| You know, again, we've talked about the growth policy plan that hopefully will be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| this afternoon down in Farragut, but the zoning prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| I mean, if you've got an RV piece of property and the new growth policy plan changes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| has it going to rural living as it does, the zoning will rule, which will allow up to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| As you mentioned, it's 460, 470 homes that would be available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| You know, I think this is a good opportunity and one of the opposition, I appreciate her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| bringing up the new plan because there has been two and a half years and a million plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| dollars spent on it, but I don't think it's in conflict personally with two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| because, I mean, if there's sewer availability, the water's there, the utilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| I recognize that, you know, maybe some of the roads get a little more narrow in areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| but gosh, I was looking at the staff report and it said there's up to 70 feet of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| of way, I think, in some areas on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| So I think, you know, in Knox Chapman running utilities out there, the way the utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| generally operate are, you know, they want to run their utilities where the growth is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| So, I mean, they lay the sewer lines and the water lines, that type of thing, in anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| I do see, you know, that there is a lot of rural area around there and very much respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| that, but I just don't think that two units would be against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| We just, a couple of months ago, you know, we just had a big zoning right up on Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| Highway, discussion with a lot of utilities and with Thunder Mountain properties up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7523)|
| 2:05:30| Chapman Highway, and a lot of new infrastructure has gone into that section of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| recently, and this is, I don't know, a mile and a half, give or take, I don't know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| how far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I just wanted to make the comment that I just, I think it's in line, not out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Okay, we have a motion and a second on the floor, and that is to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| amendment to rural residential, a person, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, I thought you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7552)|
| 2:05:59| going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| I changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| And I'm going to have something after this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| So, clarification, Mike, what density under agriculture can be developed on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7566)|
| 2:06:19| Under the agricultural land use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| This recommends up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7583)|

| 2:06:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| On to the second recommendation, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7603)|
| 2:06:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| So I do know this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| I know this street very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| I'm one of those cyclists that likes to ride over this way, and I have actually been chased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| by a dog on Pickett's Gap numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| It's a very dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I hate this vote because this is exactly what I don't like to see in South Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7629)|
| 2:07:17| and throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| But unfortunately, with it zoned RB, I think our hands are kind of tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7641)|
| 2:07:30| And at 1DUA for this property as PR, it's a much better option, unfortunately, than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7650)|
| 2:07:40| leaving it the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| And I hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| It's a really beautiful area over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| So I just want to make those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Yeah, I think that the PR, I think the staff recommendation for one unit an acre is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7673)|
| 2:08:07| It's essentially a down zone in the number of units that could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| The requirement and the condition that the delineated portion shall be left undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| I think preserves a lot of what we want to value in South Knoxville along those slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7696)|
| 2:08:26| And I think that once you take that area out and you concentrate that one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| what's actually built out is still going to be relatively dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7712)|
| 2:08:40| And so I don't think the request for two is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| And I'd like to make a motion to approve one unit per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7728)|

| 2:09:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| You know, I want to go on record here to say that, you know, Commissioner Schelso pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7748)|
| 2:09:17| out the real threat of this RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| And if it wasn't for that existing RB zone on this property, on the flat part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7763)|
| 2:09:33| property with access to utilities, I don't know if I would have even supported the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| change, quite frankly, because I do hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| But you know, to me, this is a defensive mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| I think there's a lot of people that would take advantage of this if we didn't protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| it with this PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=7798)|

| 3:03:51| wanted to clarify so the previous plan that they're referring to was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| in July of 2023 it was a different design we the Planning Commission did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11035)|
| 3:04:01| approve peripheral setback reductions but with a new plan we reconsider those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11041)|
| 3:04:07| so you can't take that into consideration you can consider if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| want to but I mean those aren't set in stone we can require different peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11051)|

| 3:05:41| not any particular process at for review and approval of those chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11141)|

| 3:05:55| Commissioner Schell so mr. Reynolds would you be able to I mean I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11155)|
| 3:06:02| looking at it to the there was on the one we previously approved it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11162)|
| 3:06:08| there was a so there was a 15-foot peripheral setback but that was just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| one corner and then like a 20 on the other I guess this plan basically brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11174)|
| 3:06:27| the units closer to the exterior right and that's why there's more peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| setback requests well previously the peripheral setback was a 20-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| peripheral on the western boundary and then only a 15-foot peripheral on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| top northeast corner next to the detention pond they haven't changed so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| that this plan has the same peripheral setback request as a previous plan it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| but you are correct that because they reoriented the units you know before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11213)|
| 3:06:58| they had very few units that were up against the peripheral setback now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| units are pushed to the exterior of the property and now we have more units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11221)|
| 3:07:06| along the edge along the peripheral okay I mean I just this is just my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11226)|
| 3:07:13| opinion I suppose I liked the first concept plan better I liked the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| center court that existed and it didn't seem to put as many units closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11238)|
| 3:07:26| neighbors so I'm not sure why there was a change but you know it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11246)|
| 3:07:37| types of setbacks so I don't think we're really changing what's gonna affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11257)|
| 3:07:44| neighbors that much you're bringing you're moving the roads away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| neighbors and putting structures next to them instead which if I lived in one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11269)|
| 3:07:55| those properties I'd prefer to look at the back of a structure as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| traffic so I'm kind of split on it so I liked the previous design as a whole but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11278)|
| 3:08:04| as a neighbor I think I would prefer this so I don't know mr. Stanton would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11284)|
| 3:08:10| you like to make a comment no sir thank you okay all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| Commissioner Barger just one quick clarification for I guess staff I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11295)|
| 3:08:21| looking at the concept plan and also reading the comments and on the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| plan it looks like there's just a landscape buffer on the southwest corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11305)|
| 3:08:33| and doesn't go all the way around is that am I reading that right yes on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11313)|
| 3:08:39| landscape plan so the proposed landscaping you're right on the western| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| boundary just has the landscaping closer to what I guess the southwest corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11322)|
| 3:08:47| the property closest to Westland there's a recommended condition and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| staff were to extend that landscaping I guess to the to the north as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11333)|
| 3:09:01| units go now that is the recommendation is a type C landscape screen so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| what just you like it won't create a solid screen of landscaping it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11345)|
| 3:09:11| supposed to be a like a filtered view so the Commission felt a more like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11351)|
| 3:09:17| complete you know screening is appropriate than a type B landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| would be more appropriate okay thank you I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11360)|
| 3:09:28| last year Thank You mr. chair you know the staff has been the one that's worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11368)|
| 3:09:36| with this developer on an old plan and a new plan and the staff would be the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11376)|
| 3:09:40| that I would assume would err on the side of caution as it relates to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| landscape screen and I'm I'm a little bit like mr. shell so where you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11384)|
| 3:09:51| old it was a cool layout but the old road and all the traffic in this and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| lights of the cars and all that sort of thing being on the exterior probably is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| a little more intrusive so I you know I'm I think staff has probably worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11401)|
| 3:10:08| with this enough and if they're comfortable with it I think I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| comfortable with it considering what we've done previously with this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| property so I'm going to make the motion that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| with the 46 attached townhouses in the reduction of the purple setback as shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| subject to the five conditions which would include the extension of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| landscape screen as per staff recommendation we've got a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11428)|
| 3:10:35| vice-chair Newton seconded by Commissioner Midas to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| development plan for up to 46 attached townhomes and the reduction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| peripheral setback per staff recommendation subject to the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11443)|
| 3:10:48| noted conditions Commissioner Barger Commissioner Newton would you consider a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11448)|
| 3:10:56| friendly addition to that but it was a thicker landscape screen well this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11456)|
| 3:11:07| tough because you know I like you just for the neighbors you know I so we'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11467)|
| 3:11:16| talking about a type B instead of a type C is what you're saying yeah I I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| familiar with this area and you look across the street at Highland Point or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| Highland Row and all of those condos and townhomes are hidden behind trees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| the neighbors can't really see into that neighborhood and this one's more kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11491)|
| 3:11:36| out in the open so to kind of satisfy neighbors I was thinking you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| it would be nice to have a thicker screen go around the property just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11500)|
| 3:11:46| thought while you contemplate that their vice-chair let me ask mr. Reynolds his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11506)|
| 3:11:51| thoughts on the matter but I just want to make sure everyone understood so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| staff recommendation is just to extend the additional landscape screening where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11515)|
| 3:12:01| the peripheral setback is being reduced but not around the entire peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| boundary of the subdivisions or the development I think you know either type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11525)|
| 3:12:13| B or type C would be appropriate in this location I I'd recommend a type C just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| because the existing development behind the existing houses to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| particularly are closer to Westland Drive and the and the trees might provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11542)|
| 3:12:27| a because every views will for the most part be at an angle so you screen more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11547)|
| 3:12:33| with and if you were looking straight on but I think a type you know be able you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11553)|
| 3:12:39| guarantee they have a better screen in the end with the type B screen so so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11559)|
| 3:12:45| just clarified that's a recommendation or a requirement that's currently in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| there the the staff recommendation is to type C which is more distributed so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11568)|
| 3:12:52| further apart it should be further apart but not and not create a complete screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| that would be for all kind of boundaries where the setback is reduced correct and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11576)|
| 3:13:01| that's just on the western boundary and then just a little bit on the eastern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| like the northeast corner yeah get kind of right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11585)|
| 3:13:12| last year not that I care but the applicant are you amenable to doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11592)|
| 3:13:22| B instead of the C can we get a little more information as to what exactly that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| means if that's mr. Reynolds or so a type B screen means that you'll that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| evergreen trees are required space so that when they mature it creates a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11611)|
| 3:13:37| visual screen so you know you don't you don't see through that that landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| screen a type C screen they're they're planted further apart so they won't grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| together completely there will be a visit some some visibility between and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| through the trees and and just the same peripheral setback area that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11630)|
| 3:13:54| discussed for the yes variable okay so I would I would make my friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11634)|
| 3:14:01| amendment because I like Nancy a lot so on the staff recommendation as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11641)|
| 3:14:12| relates to number four we would replace type C with type B and then make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11652)|
| 3:14:19| motion to approve subject to the to the five conditions with that modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11659)|
| 3:14:26| second all right so we have a motion in a second to approve what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=11666)|

| 3:31:46| wall it just goes up straight on the proposed property which is nothing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12706)|
| 3:31:50| the hill that starts at the top it comes down towards Henson Road and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12710)|
| 3:32:01| really we haven't spoken with the developers they've not approached us our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12721)|
| 3:32:06| biggest questions are regarding drainage those you know specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12726)|
| 3:32:12| properties the homeowners are afraid that construction with the storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12732)|
| 3:32:20| and all that the retaining walls are going to buckle and they're going to have to be rebuilt. They already have those issues that have been playing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12740)|
| 3:32:33| The other thing that we would like to see basically is a concept plan. I mean they want to change the rezoning from the low density to the medium density and on four acres how many are they going to build and what are they planning on building. I don't think they can do apartments but as far as duplexes you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12753)|
| 3:32:59| single homes, townhouses, but we would like to know what their plan is before we can actually say yes we approve or no you know we still have issues with this. I think some of the other issues that they have are like what's going to happen is they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12779)|
| 3:33:25| allowed to disturb like 60% of the trees that are on this property and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12805)|
| 3:33:32| drainage that we already have what's going to happen when that happens. Is there going to be a buffer you know on that piece of property that cuts up to our homes? Are they going to leave the trees up there? Are they going to put a fence? What are they going to do to protect the properties below that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12812)|
| 3:33:54| Noise, privacy, excess traffic. Whether anybody believes it or not, that Henson Road from over Middlebrook Pike, Mid Park, Henson, to Matlock, up to over Tawang is the third cut through between those two major roads and the traffic is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12834)|
| 3:34:23| terrible and it's winding and it's curvy and we don't even have a snow removal list so don't even think about going on that road. So basically those are the questions you know that we have. Are they planning on finishing this within a year? Do they want their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12863)|
| 3:34:45| entrance to be right above ours on Henson Road? Or they can go up Henson Road, up the hill. We just have questions and basically nobody has contacted us from the construction company. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12885)|
| 3:35:04| Thank you. I can answer your questions or respond to any concerns. Okay, thank you. Commission? Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12904)|
| 3:35:20| Will we get to see this? I'm thinking about this in relationship to the buffers and the trees retained and that sort of thing. Will we get to see this again based upon the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12920)|
| 3:35:34| Would you like to comment on that? Yes, so Tawang Pass is approved by station use so that it will come to this board. And Seymour Canyon and Duplexes are targeted by a subcommission of six or more people across the planet and then required to come to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12934)|
| 3:35:58| So, I'm sorry, Seymour Canyon and Duplexes will not be five blocks. Any other places they will not come back? Okay, but because this is in the city we can't do conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12958)|
| 3:36:22| That is correct. What are your plans in terms of the, are you planning on demuting that entire block where you're not engaged with the hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12982)|
| 3:36:37| Well, our plans are to develop within the requirements of the zoning that's approved. So, we have not developed, we're going to develop based on what the commission allows us to do with the zoning change. As soon as they can change something from A, then we'll work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=12997)|
| 3:36:53| But regardless of how intense you develop, you don't currently have any plans to preserve some of the existing tree buffer. Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13013)|
| 3:37:05| Well, I haven't even thought anything about the development at all because other than the Seymour Canyon residential, that would be the scope at this point. Something that would be in harmony with the area and not to over-improve and not to under-improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13025)|
| 3:37:21| I would just ask and encourage you to consider the landscape that is there currently and as you develop your plans, consider leaving as much of that in the dams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13041)|
| 3:37:34| The landscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| Yes, I can't make a condition for that. So, I'm just encouraging you to consider the landscape and the trees that are there and those that can be left to keep it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13056)|
| 3:37:48| Well, I'm a tree hugger and I've done many petitions to save trees. So, I assure you, we will definitely be debunking that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13068)|
| 3:37:56| Commissioner Pottis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| Yeah, hi. I just was going to say, as soon as it is rezoned, would you be willing to meet with the neighbors of our existing woods once you do have a plan prior to coming back here for any kind of special use approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13079)|
| 3:38:16| If that's something that we would need to do, we certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| We would encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| Sure, we could certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13101)|
| 3:38:22| Okay, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| Commissioner Gates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| So, I know that the concerns that were brought up with, there's a concern related to runoff and that's going to get handled for the city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13107)|
| 3:38:40| The site is completely in hillside protection, so I do think that it would be very likely that they will go over the thresholds that will lead to them coming back here, at least for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13120)|
| 3:38:59| And also, I think that if you look at the adjacent subdivision, Embrey Wood, it is also R&3 and I think this would probably be very similar even for Westville, Tempest Townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13139)|
| 3:39:12| So, with that, I'll make a motion to approve the Northwest City Sector Plan from LDR and hillside protection to NDR and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13152)|
| 3:39:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13171)|
| 3:39:32| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Gates, seconded by Commissioner Schelso to approve the Sector Plan amendment to NDR per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13172)|
| 3:39:42| Any other lines here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13182)|

| 3:40:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13201)|
| 3:40:04| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Schelso to approve the one-year plan amendment to the NDR classification per staff recommendation along with the hillside protection designation being retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13204)|
| 3:40:20| Seeing no lines, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13220)|
| 3:40:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13222)|

| 3:40:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| I'll make a motion to rezone from NG and hillside protection to RN3 and hillside protection per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13226)|
| 3:40:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13235)|

| 3:40:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13251)|
| 3:40:52| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13252)|
| 3:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13256)|
| 3:40:59| On to item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13259)|
| 3:41:02| Applicant Homestead Land Holdings, location south side of number 5 East side of Broome Road, 2.88 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13262)|
| 3:41:11| Present plan and zone designation, Low Density Residential, RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13271)|
| 3:41:16| Proposed plan designation, MDRO, Medium Density Residential Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13276)|
| 3:41:22| Existing land use, single family residential, agriculture, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13282)|
| 3:41:28| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13288)|
| 3:41:34| First recommendation for motion one would be to approve the sector plan amendment to MDRO land use classification because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13294)|
| 3:41:45| Motion two, the recommendation is to approve the one year plan amendment to the MDRO land use classification because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13305)|
| 3:41:56| Motion three, the recommendation is to approve the RN5 district because it is consistent with the surrounding development and the intent of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13316)|
| 3:42:07| Applicant Briscoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| Yes, I'm Mr. Rackley from Rackley Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| I'm representing DAP and Homestead Land Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| So, let's see, PO Box 30456.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| I'm still pressing 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Rackley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13344)|
| 3:42:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13345)|
| 3:42:26| I'll make reservations on it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| Staff summed this up perfectly from a planning perspective that this is a great location for RN5, which will allow us some flexibility on the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13349)|
| 3:42:38| It is located on a major arterial and a major collector and with citizens living behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13358)|
| 3:42:47| We did, representatives that I've heard of, Homestead, Sutterbrook, Holbrook, Fox Prison, and Belden met with this gentleman and a few others just the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13367)|
| 3:42:57| I want to thank the commission for understanding that we don't spend a lot of time and money designing the site before we have it zoned for use that we intend to use the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13377)|
| 3:43:09| We did make a commitment that once the zoning process is complete, we'll know how, what the rules are that we can build the site for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13389)|
| 3:43:17| We'd love to meet with the community leaders and share our plans and take care of any concerns that we may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13397)|
| 3:43:26| With that, I respectfully request an approval of the subject to the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13406)|
| 3:43:31| With that, I will reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13411)|
| 3:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| Mr. Hayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| John Hayes, 6908 Stockton Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13421)|
| 3:43:47| And like the gentleman said, we did have a constructive conversation last night with the developers and the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13427)|
| 3:43:54| a couple of principals, and we had, I think, three representatives from our neighborhood association there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13434)|
| 3:44:00| And so we had a good talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| I guess our concern basically is, you know, we found out about this about 14 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13442)|
| 3:44:07| And it is, again, one of the last pieces of property within our community, West Hills Community Association, that's not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13447)|
| 3:44:15| And we understand it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| We're not opposed to, I think, you know, some downed estuaries and duplexes going in on River Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13457)|
| 3:44:23| I guess our opposition right now is we don't know what exactly is going to take place, how much wood density is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13463)|
| 3:44:32| And it's just so new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13472)|
| 3:44:33| It's 14 days old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13473)|
| 3:44:36| And we had to make the effort to contact the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13476)|
| 3:44:41| And they were good enough to meet with us again last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| But our neighbors are not educated to what's going to happen with that property in River Pike that feeds into Broom Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13484)|
| 3:44:51| which already is a connector road, and most of you folks are familiar with Broom Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13491)|
| 3:44:56| It's a pretty heavily traveled road from River Pike all the way up to Wal-Mart, the same area over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13496)|
| 3:45:03| So, you know, we're just simply asking for 30 to 60 days, something that we can meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13503)|
| 3:45:09| We're going to have two more community association meetings, one in May, one in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13509)|
| 3:45:13| And we'd like to just gather the neighborhood and say, hey, this is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13513)|
| 3:45:18| You know, it's a simple request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| And so that's why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13523)|
| 3:45:26| Well, I respect greatly his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13526)|
| 3:45:30| It also leads to the point that as much time as a postponement accomplishes nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13530)|
| 3:45:37| because even if the rezoning goes through, we still hang out on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13537)|
| 3:45:41| And now all that postponement and time that they'll meet with us with our plans, the zoning is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13541)|
| 3:45:47| That's why those intimate conversations on uses after a plan is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13547)|
| 3:45:52| which happens after the property is zoned for a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| So, again, with that, I just respectfully ask for some staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| And we have a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| And the owner of South Brook lives in West Hits in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13563)|
| 3:46:06| That's 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13566)|
| 3:46:07| So we will have outreach with them once the property, assuming it gets rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13567)|
| 3:46:14| gets through city council and we develop a plan, that's where we'll meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13574)|
| 3:46:18| and be able to show them exactly what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13578)|
| 3:46:21| We're not trying to hide anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| There's a process to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| And a postponement, rezoning, to get to know the developer and his plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13585)|
| 3:46:29| is really just a tactic for delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13589)|
| 3:46:32| Because the developer can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13592)|
| 3:46:35| The developer's plans can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| Rezoning is rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| It stands on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| And anything can be done on the property within the requirements of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13600)|
| 3:46:44| that exists on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13604)|
| 3:46:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13606)|
| 3:46:47| Mr. Abrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13609)|
| 3:46:50| Similar to the previous case, this is right on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13610)|
| 3:46:54| I drive by this weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| And I think that I'll be willing to see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13618)|
| 3:47:04| I feel like the sales line has been up there for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| As long as I can remember, it seems like on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| I think that to complete our work in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13632)|
| 3:47:16| there is a lot of higher density all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| And it makes sense to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13640)|
| 3:47:22| So with that, I'll make some motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13642)|
| 3:47:27| I'll make a motion to amend the Northwest City Sector Plan from LDR to NDR slash O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13647)|
| 3:47:36| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13656)|
| 3:47:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| We have a motion from Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Shelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13659)|
| 3:47:43| to approve the second plan amendment to MDRO, land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13663)|
| 3:47:49| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13672)|
| 3:47:53| I'd like to talk before the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13675)|
| 3:47:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13679)|
| 3:48:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13680)|
| 3:48:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13681)|
| 3:48:02| I'll make a motion to amend the One Year Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13682)|
| 3:48:05| this location from LDR to NDRO for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13685)|
| 3:48:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13691)|
| 3:48:12| We have a motion to approve the One Year Plan amendment to NDRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13692)|
| 3:48:20| for staff recommendation by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| Shelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| Commissioner Adams, would you like to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13707)|
| 3:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13708)|
| 3:48:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13709)|
| 3:48:30| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13710)|
| 3:48:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13711)|
| 3:48:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| I'll go ahead and make a motion for rezoning from RN2 to RN5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13715)|
| 3:48:41| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13723)|
| 3:48:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins, seconded by Commissioner Shelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13724)|
| 3:48:49| to approve the RN5 district because it is consistent with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13729)|
| 3:48:55| development and intent of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13735)|
| 3:48:58| And before we vote, we're going to hear from Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13738)|
| 3:49:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13742)|
| 3:49:03| I don't feel like it's that consistent with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13743)|
| 3:49:08| area because of the zones I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| However, the fact that it is on the major arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13751)|
| 3:49:15| and there's a facility right behind it, we've already got buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13755)|
| 3:49:20| So that's why I'm comfortable moving the RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| And to the applicant's point, the zoning is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| whether this applicant is in front of us or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13768)|
| 3:49:31| So that's what I was concerned about, but seeing that buffer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13771)|
| 3:49:34| I feel like it's a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13774)|
| 3:49:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13778)|
| 3:49:39| So we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13783)|
| 3:49:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13784)|
| 3:49:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13786)|
| 3:49:47| On to agenda item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13787)|
| 3:49:51| The applicant is Reverend Harold Newport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| Location, southwest side of Eden Lake Road, south of Mains Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| north of McDonald Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13798)|
| 3:50:02| Approximate size of track, 3.93 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| Present plan and zoning designation is low density residential, RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13805)|
| 3:50:11| Proposed plan designation is MDR0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13811)|
| 3:50:14| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13814)|
| 3:50:18| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13818)|
| 3:50:26| The staff recommendation is to approve the second plan amendment to MDR0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13826)|
| 3:50:30| land use because it is compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13830)|
| 3:50:34| Motion two, staff recommendation, approve one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13834)|
| 3:50:38| to MDR0 land use classification because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13838)|
| 3:50:41| compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| And motion three, staff recommendation, approve the RN5 district because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13843)|
| 3:50:48| is consistent with recommended land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| and surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13852)|
| 3:50:54| I see the applicant is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13854)|
| 3:50:56| If you'll say your name and address, Reverend Newport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13856)|
| 3:50:58| I am Harold Newport, 2334 Dandridge Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13858)|

| 3:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13868)|
| 3:51:09| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| OK, we have some folks standing up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| Would you like to proceed or defer, Reverend Newport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13873)|
| 3:51:16| We'll let the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13876)|
| 3:51:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13877)|
| 3:51:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13886)|
| 3:51:28| My name is William Crawley, 11208 Beaman Lake Road, Nottisville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13888)|
| 3:51:37| I've been living on Beaman Lake Road since 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13897)|
| 3:51:42| I'm the third oldest landowner on Beaman Lake Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13902)|
| 3:51:49| First of all, I'm not opposed to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| Here's what I'm opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| The road somewhere, some of the staff said this road is 18 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13915)|
| 3:52:02| And I've made my living working in pike fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13922)|
| 3:52:06| Now, I admit, I've missed a few measures, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13926)|
| 3:52:09| but I've never missed another two foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13929)|
| 3:52:13| I made that road from my house down to McAllen River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13933)|
| 3:52:17| The widest part of it is 16 foot from my house south to McAllen River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13937)|
| 3:52:24| In this, I'm going to say the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| going north on Beaman Lake Road where the park is at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| I've only, well, me, get on in this one curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13952)|
| 3:52:38| I guess you only get it when you look at it from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13958)|
| 3:52:44| Not only that, it's been several years back, the city of Nottisville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13964)|
| 3:52:50| my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| My driveway, I come here to work on an evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13972)|
| 3:52:55| Well, there's a big hatch out in the corner of my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13975)|
| 3:52:58| Right across from where they want to put the pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13978)|
| 3:53:01| there's a long way across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| There's a big hatch that I don't know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| Neighbors said, no, it's a city truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13986)|
| 3:53:09| We don't want to move nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| We've got to move this and get the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13992)|
| 3:53:13| I guess it's because when we trade, I come here on an evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13993)|
| 3:53:16| 8th, 5th, 6th, and the rest of the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13996)|
| 3:53:19| It's been several years, but we ain't had a ditch right there in my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=13999)|
| 3:53:23| Sunday, I had a plan for this meeting they had at the church on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14003)|
| 3:53:31| I wanted to talk, sit on the bench there, five minutes from one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14011)|
| 3:53:35| I said, sir, it took 400 minutes from two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| It's 50-something calls, but if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| I think it's in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14021)|
| 3:53:44| It's in the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| It's in my comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| And he had exactly how many of them going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14028)|
| 3:53:51| And when I said, take that chair out of the middle of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14031)|
| 3:53:54| I'm going to just get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14034)|
| 3:53:56| And he said, I'm going to sit on the bench, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| you got some footage to get a little bit out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14038)|
| 3:54:01| but I'm going to just break it, just take it out of the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14041)|
| 3:54:06| Going north, there were several of them doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14046)|
| 3:54:09| but they weren't near as many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| And the funny thing is, this road, I can't remember how many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14051)|
| 3:54:16| they were going to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14056)|
| 3:54:17| It's happening all over the town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| We've got somebody getting killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| So we're going to go somewhere, and like I mentioned the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| the dam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14067)|
| 3:54:28| You're just pouring gasoline on a burning van?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| If that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14070)|
| 3:54:32| And when somebody gets killed, and it's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| in the time that it's going to start construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14074)|
| 3:54:36| within five years, there could be somebody killed on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14076)|
| 3:54:39| So I'm going to have my mind back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14079)|
| 3:54:41| No dam at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14081)|
| 3:54:43| We're not going to prove to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| We're not going to prove you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14085)|
| 3:54:46| But I just want to let you know what the circumstances are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14086)|
| 3:54:50| I think you could be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14092)|
| 3:54:53| One other thing is, I forgot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14093)|
| 3:54:57| This is my first time we've had the forehand about to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14097)|
| 3:55:02| And I don't know if any of you guys were on the commission back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14102)|
| 3:55:05| or not, whether it was approved or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14105)|
| 3:55:08| but they got something out of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| And they were like, oh, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| But Dean Teague, who was the city council person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14114)|
| 3:55:18| and Robert was the city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| When I brought Robert up to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| we went to that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14122)|
| 3:55:23| Dean Teague asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14123)|
| 3:55:24| Little Brooke, will you be willing to help me pay for the wiring in that room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14124)|
| 3:55:29| Oh, my man, who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| They paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14133)|
| 3:55:35| One month, the next city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14135)|
| 3:55:38| When he came back, just like today, we were the last one on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| This is everybody ready to hand it all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14143)|
| 3:55:47| Somebody ready to hand it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14147)|
| 3:55:50| Now, some of what they got to do now, what they want to do again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| right there at the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14153)|
| 3:55:55| They've got the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| Brooklyn ain't got no wiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14159)|
| 3:56:03| Mr. Steven Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14163)|
| 3:56:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14166)|
| 3:56:07| My name's Steven Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| I moved to Knoxville in September of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14168)|
| 3:56:13| This used to be part of the territory when I lived in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14173)|
| 3:56:16| And how I was able to purchase my home is I'm a successful federal whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14176)|
| 3:56:22| Detected $70 million in fraud from my former employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14182)|
| 3:56:27| So it was something thanks to China that didn't need to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14187)|
| 3:56:32| And the end result of this is I stopped the Chinese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14192)|
| 3:56:36| from reading our military's email on the DISA network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14196)|
| 3:56:41| if anybody knows what that is, as well as listening to phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14201)|
| 3:56:46| My background is in telecommunications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14206)|
| 3:56:48| Anyway, I do have a couple of questions before I get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14208)|
| 3:56:53| From the time that the signs were placed on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14213)|
| 3:57:01| I'm sorry, how long is the time from the finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14221)|
| 3:57:04| that you're putting signs on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14224)|
| 3:57:11| Who would like to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14231)|
| 3:57:15| There are a certain amount of days before the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| I believe it's 12 business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Sorry, 12 non-counter days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14241)|
| 3:57:25| Well, the reason I'm asking this is that whenever this started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14245)|
| 3:57:29| I was actually in Texas taking care of some family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14249)|
| 3:57:32| And I came home and found the signs, and I went home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14252)|
| 3:57:36| and it even made a picture of a bus driving by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14256)|
| 3:57:39| If you look at the comments, it's the first time I made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14259)|
| 3:57:42| And it shows the width of the road with the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14262)|
| 3:57:45| And, you know, I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14265)|
| 3:57:48| I was homeless from 2014 to 2015 when I was a whistleblower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14268)|
| 3:57:53| If anybody knows what happens to us when we do this, it's harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14273)|
| 3:57:58| And I'm glad I didn't have to compose and defend this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14278)|
| 3:58:03| Mr. Bishop, I just want to forewarn you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| We're down to about a minute and four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14285)|
| 3:58:07| Yeah, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14287)|
| 3:58:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14288)|
| 3:58:09| But I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14289)|
| 3:58:10| I took four hours off work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14290)|
| 3:58:11| You can get a little leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14293)|
| 3:58:14| The opposition gets a total of five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14294)|
| 3:58:16| and I've extended to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14296)|
| 3:58:18| So anyway, the bottom line is that since I haven't lived here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14298)|
| 3:58:24| I've seen residents from Golden Age driving their disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14304)|
| 3:58:29| scooters up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14309)|
| 3:58:31| The street is only 16 feet wide, as my neighbor has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14311)|
| 3:58:35| Home values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| We didn't see the plan on this until Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14317)|
| 3:58:40| I'm sorry, until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14320)|
| 3:58:41| And it's going to be budding right up against the name of my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14321)|
| 3:58:44| So then you could potentially have a home value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| because it's going to be federally funded, Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14327)|
| 3:58:51| And it's just basically not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14331)|
| 3:58:54| So what I'd like to see is either a post home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| or require the building to be pushed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14336)|
| 3:58:59| and have a different ingress or egress method that I've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14339)|
| 3:59:02| made in the comments with pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14342)|
| 3:59:05| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14345)|
| 3:59:06| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14346)|
| 3:59:15| Forgive me for moving slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14355)|
| 3:59:16| I made it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14356)|
| 3:59:19| Mr. Aldermen, I just want to say that we have tried as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14359)|
| 3:59:26| to be mission conscious, to be conscious of doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14366)|
| 3:59:31| for people, especially in the golden years of their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14371)|
| 3:59:35| and to provide an adequate space for them to live and to enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14375)|
| 3:59:40| the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| We know that there is need, because we have the waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| so that all we're trying to do is to serve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14385)|
| 3:59:49| and to help the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| That's what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14391)|
| 3:59:54| I think I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14394)|
| 3:59:55| Alvin Nance, 1735 Woodhaven Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14395)|
| 3:59:59| 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| It's very important to say we're serving as a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14401)|
| 4:00:04| to build this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14404)|
| 4:00:05| We're talking about building 85 units for elderly individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14405)|
| 4:00:10| As the staff has looked at this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14410)|
| 4:00:13| there's an existing 100, I think it's 110 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| 101 units at a golden age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| Retirement Village 1 that Riverman Brooklyn built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14419)|
| 4:00:22| I think, back in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14422)|
| 4:00:25| They always had plans to build additional housing in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| when they acquired all of the land at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14428)|
| 4:00:31| We're looking at building 85 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| It will be sold for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| We're not looking at just being families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14436)|
| 4:00:39| We're talking about 73 one-bedroom units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14439)|
| 4:00:41| and 12 two-bedroom units at this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14441)|
| 4:00:45| We are going to be applying for the only housing tax credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14445)|
| 4:00:49| As the gentleman said, behind us is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14449)|
| 4:00:53| that will accept Section 8 voucher holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14453)|
| 4:00:56| But we are going to use the only housing tax credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14456)|
| 4:00:59| to actually construct the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14459)|
| 4:01:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14462)|
| 4:01:05| Question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14465)|
| 4:01:08| I have a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14468)|
| 4:01:11| Given the population that you're planning on serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14471)|
| 4:01:14| is there currently or is there a plan to have some type of van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14474)|
| 4:01:19| or group transportation to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14479)|
| 4:01:23| There's public transportation already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14483)|
| 4:01:26| The bus, the gentleman just referenced a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14486)|
| 4:01:30| the K-Train bus actually stops at Golden Age Retirement Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14490)|
| 4:01:34| So the residents actually get on the bus right there at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14494)|
| 4:01:38| So the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14498)|
| 4:01:39| The city bus, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14499)|
| 4:01:40| Okay, but nothing in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14500)|
| 4:01:42| No, we will not provide any additional, none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14504)|
| 4:01:45| Commissioner Schultz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14505)|
| 4:01:48| This is a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| Is senior living a very specific type of settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14511)|
| 4:01:56| that senior living is for, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14516)|
| 4:02:01| is allowed in an office use, commercial use, residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14521)|
| 4:02:08| It's allowed in R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14528)|
| 4:02:12| I guess what I'm trying to understand is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14532)|
| 4:02:15| I mean, I see there's R and 5 very close in the other building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14535)|
| 4:02:21| but it does seem to be a little out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14541)|
| 4:02:25| EN, you know, one property over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14545)|
| 4:02:31| So I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14551)|
| 4:02:32| is there another zone that's more appropriate for that type of use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14552)|
| 4:02:37| Because I think if someone were to come before us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14557)|
| 4:02:41| we want R and 5 for multifamily, I think, given the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14561)|
| 4:02:46| I think that might not make as much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14566)|
| 4:02:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14577)|
| 4:02:58| If you were to look at my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14578)|
| 4:02:59| I drew a picture that shows what could be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14579)|
| 4:03:06| If it's an independent living facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| then that would be the use of it as classified as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14588)|
| 4:03:12| as well as special use in R and 3, R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14592)|
| 4:03:15| as permitted use in R and 5, R and 6, R and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14595)|
| 4:03:25| I guess what Zoe was worried about is options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14605)|
| 4:03:27| whether it would happen using the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14607)|
| 4:03:35| I've only considered the request of R and 5 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14615)|
| 4:03:38| and found that it would be comparable with that R and 5 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14618)|
| 4:03:43| and that would obviously be an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14628)|
| 4:03:53| Commissioner Ives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| My question is for probably engineering as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14637)|
| 4:04:00| and maybe Mr. Haynes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14640)|
| 4:04:03| When it comes to expanding that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| do you guys have any plans of being able to help out the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14645)|
| 4:04:10| and increase the width of that piece of that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14650)|
| 4:04:15| We do not have funding to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14655)|
| 4:04:18| I know that sometimes it's around the city coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| but maybe the city would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14661)|
| 4:04:25| Well, it occurs to the city to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14665)|
| 4:04:28| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14668)|
| 4:04:33| I can't speak for the civil transportation group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14673)|
| 4:04:37| that may have plans or may not have plans for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| As far as the development services group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14680)|
| 4:04:43| unless they had a trip generation threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| it wouldn't require a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14687)|
| 4:04:50| and the traffic impact study would typically generate improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14690)|
| 4:04:55| and even those improvements are usually limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| So it's not going to trip that study, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14698)|
| 4:05:03| I'm not sure if it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14703)|
| 4:05:07| It was how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14709)|
| 4:05:12| My guess is that it would not, but it's a bigger question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14712)|
| 4:05:20| Mr. Nance, I know you guys have overseen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14720)|
| 4:05:23| some other senior living developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14723)|
| 4:05:27| and you want to comment about the level of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14727)|
| 4:05:32| at these senior living facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14732)|
| 4:05:36| Well, as we're constructing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14736)|
| 4:05:40| COVID requires you have to provide a certain number of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14740)|
| 4:05:45| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14745)|
| 4:05:47| What I will tell you is that most of our senior living facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14747)|
| 4:05:50| even though there's adequate parking being provided for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14750)|
| 4:05:54| most of those residents do not own a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14754)|
| 4:05:56| There are some that do own vehicles there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14756)|
| 4:05:59| but I would also say that probably family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| who are going to be coming and checking on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| a senior like them who will drive to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| but as far as those particular individuals, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14765)|
| 4:06:09| I would also go back and say that I do believe the cost of proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| what we're talking about building the vast majority of the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| I think, to our site will come off of McDonald Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14776)|
| 4:06:19| which is about 600 feet from McDonald Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14779)|
| 4:06:24| Sir, you can't guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14784)|
| 4:06:26| If you want to see the intersection at McDonald Road and Beeman Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14786)|
| 4:06:29| it's completely coming apart because of the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14789)|
| 4:06:36| You can't guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14796)|
| 4:06:38| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| I'm going to pick up on what Commissioner Salazar was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14800)|
| 4:06:43| which I think was about the Zone 5 versus 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14803)|
| 4:06:51| which, is there anything that this opportunity can do in 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14811)|
| 4:06:57| that it wouldn't be able to do in 3 by special right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| if it was independent living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14821)|
| 4:07:04| The plan still would be functional, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14824)|
| 4:07:09| It's not what that can ask for, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14829)|
| 4:07:14| Lisa, we haven't seen a development plan for the project yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| so some of this isn't right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14838)|
| 4:07:25| It would mainly be density, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14845)|
| 4:07:28| If there could be a multi-family here versus townhomes in R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14848)|
| 4:07:32| There are differences between what can be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14852)|
| 4:07:36| even though it's a density thing, between R and 3, 4, and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14856)|
| 4:07:39| Mainly, R and 3 only allows townhomes, which are like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14859)|
| 4:07:43| You can't stack, you can't go two stories, so R and 5 does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14863)|
| 4:07:47| It's townhomes versus home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14867)|
| 4:07:50| I guess, Ms. Borte, can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14870)|
| 4:07:55| Because the question was about independent living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| and that designation being allowed in 5 versus 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14878)|
| 4:08:03| but the difference is that 5 can be stacked, 3 cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14883)|
| 4:08:09| It can still be independent living, but it's the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14889)|
| 4:08:13| Independent living facilities are subject to the dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14893)|
| 4:08:16| design standards for a multi-family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14896)|
| 4:08:19| and the district in which they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14899)|
| 4:08:22| When a district permits dwellings above the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14902)|
| 4:08:24| where independent living facilities may also be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14904)|
| 4:08:26| to design as such, so they're subject to the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| in which they're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| In this scenario, the district in which this is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14912)|
| 4:08:38| R and 5, is what's being proposed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14918)|
| 4:08:44| What are the dimensional standards for R and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14924)|
| 4:08:47| for independent living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14927)|
| 4:08:51| Multi-family is not permissible in R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14931)|
| 4:08:54| but townhouses are still being built in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14934)|
| 4:08:58| It's 12,000 square feet for the first three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14938)|
| 4:09:01| 3,000 square feet for each additional R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14941)|
| 4:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14953)|
| 4:09:19| Mr. Poche?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14959)|
| 4:09:21| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14961)|
| 4:09:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14962)|
| 4:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14963)|
| 4:09:27| Mr. Kuehn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| Given that this property is already next to an R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14969)|
| 4:09:34| I don't agree with all the questions of what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14974)|
| 4:09:38| but I think R and 5 is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14978)|
| 4:09:42| I've looked at properties under R and 3, R and 4, and R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14982)|
| 4:09:46| and there is a distinctive difference, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14986)|
| 4:09:49| between what you can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| I'm also familiar with the programs that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14991)|
| 4:09:55| which is a little bit of a passive tax credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| which is very challenging, I think, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=14997)|
| 4:10:02| I mean, you know, it's like running a gauntlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| You've got to have everything ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15004)|
| 4:10:06| and every high-value, every T-Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15006)|
| 4:10:09| every architecture done, all your bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15009)|
| 4:10:12| finalized by contractors, and then you still have a period of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15012)|
| 4:10:20| I'm in favor of moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| I think it'd be a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15022)|
| 4:10:23| It's an immense need we have in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| you know, with lower income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15027)|
| 4:10:29| And we've talked a lot about that in general here lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15029)|
| 4:10:33| about low-income housing, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| you talk about it from a rental aspect and vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15035)|
| 4:10:38| and you talk about it from, you know, entry-level housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15038)|
| 4:10:42| and I think that's some of the conversations we've been having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| and we're laughing at both, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15045)|
| 4:10:50| That being said, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15050)|
| 4:10:52| to approve the second-line amendments to the MDRO land use specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15052)|
| 4:10:57| because it is compatible with the surrounding bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15057)|
| 4:11:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15060)|
| 4:11:02| All right, we have a motion by Commissioner Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15062)|
| 4:11:05| seconded by Commissioner Levinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15065)|

| 4:11:16| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15076)|
| 4:11:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15080)|

| 4:11:23| I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15083)|
| 4:11:27| meeting this residential office land use specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15087)|

| 4:11:37| seconded by Commissioner Levinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15097)|
| 4:11:40| okay, Commissioner Levinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15100)|
| 4:11:42| to approve the one-year plan amendment to the MDRO land use specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15102)|
| 4:11:47| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15107)|

| 4:11:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15114)|
| 4:11:55| I'd like to make a motion to approve the RA5 general residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15115)|
| 4:11:59| district because it is consistent with the recommended land use specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15119)|
| 4:12:03| and surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15125)|
| 4:12:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| We have a motion to approve RA5 district because it is consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15127)|
| 4:12:12| recommended land use specification and surrounding developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15132)|
| 4:12:15| seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15135)|
| 4:12:18| I did say Commissioner Huber made that motion, did not I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15138)|
| 4:12:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15141)|
| 4:12:22| And then I do see some likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| Commissioner Shelfsoda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15144)|
| 4:12:25| I just want to say that I think because we now know what the project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15145)|
| 4:12:32| I want it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15152)|
| 4:12:34| but I really don't quite feel that if we solve this in another type of scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15154)|
| 4:12:42| it really fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| And so that's kind of why I was trying to get to a certain difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15164)|
| 4:12:48| So it fits, it could be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15168)|
| 4:12:51| because I think if someone came in and developed it as intense as they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15171)|
| 4:12:56| as residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15176)|
| 4:12:57| it really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15177)|
| 4:12:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15178)|
| 4:12:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15179)|
| 4:13:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15180)|

| 4:13:05| unless commissioners have other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240411?start=15185)|
