| 0:01:48| We just met from one to two today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=108)|

| 0:02:35| for Southmox merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=155)|

| 0:02:50| Yes, Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| I just have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| It's in reference to zonings, I believe, billboards and signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| And I don't have the complete document, and I'll send it to you as soon as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| But I'd like to have a discussion on what my thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| and what I've discussed with MPC and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| So you want this during our discussion time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| We'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| What we have for the consent, this is the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| This first six pages, basically four through 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Items four through 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| So check that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=215)|
| 0:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| Then I would like to just mention briefly item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| It's not on to not put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| But then go ahead and have 31 and 32, both of those properties issues on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| 31 and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Then 33 is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| And then 34 on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| 34 on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Would anybody like to have some of those pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Just a quick question on 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| 22 be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Not necessarily pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| If I can get a question answered before we vote on number six on school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| electricity for the western part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Yeah, we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Let's just pull it and ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Anything else from the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Could I hear a motion to add, defer, withdraw, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=309)|

| 0:05:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Could I hear a motion to approve consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| So the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Madam Chairman, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| On page two, pulled item number six from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| It's consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| contracts with the Lenore City Utilities Board for electric services at A.L. Watts Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Blue Grass Elementary School, Bainton-Sullaway Vocational Center, Cedar Bluff Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| Cedar Bluff Middle School, Farragut High School, Farragut Intermediate School, Farragut Primary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Farragut High School, Jim Farragut High Vocational School, Carnes High School, and the West Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| Resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| On that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I just want to mention that Ombud asked for his item to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| It is education related, so it might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We can probably dispose of this, but it would be good to get Chairwoman Carson up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| So is it go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| This is just a brief question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| It's a yes or no and maybe a why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| You've got a lot of schools listed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I'm just wanting to know if all of these schools are currently being served by Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Are we adding some or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Why are we not using KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Can we get a better deal by putting more in with KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Or what is the reason, I guess, for this split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| Or is it a split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| You've got somebody behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| He's waiting on the acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Mr. Chairman, my name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I'm the superintendent of schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| These are schools that fall within the current LCUB service area, and this is a service agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| It basically says that LCUB will provide electricity and utilities to these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| and that we will pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And so it's a fairly routine agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| and basically setting up the structure of the contractual arrangement between the school system and LCUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| But these schools are currently, as I understand it, within LCUB's service area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| and they currently are provided utilities through LCUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| They are currently provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| That's what Mr. Thomas tells me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Just hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Thirty-eight is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| And I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| On page 10, item 38, discussion and report from Knott's County School Superintendent, Jim McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| and School Board Chair, Karen Carson, on the security of our children in the Knott's County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Thank you again, Dr. McIntyre, for stepping up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| And first, before we start off on this, I would like to commend the Board of Education for their selection of Ruth Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=503)|
| 0:08:32| in terms of her ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| She has a fine reputation in terms of her legal standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| And we feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Several people that I've talked to have said that she will do a fine job at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| And there will be a thorough report that will represent us well and should answer a lot of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=530)|
| 0:09:00| Also, as a prelude, just as a follow-up to last night's discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| I want to commend you on one hand but possibly ask a question on the other as regards Simplex Grinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| And you don't have to address this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| This is just preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| That was my one of my questions was just as regards that company being chosen to be involved in finding deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=558)|
| 0:09:31| in terms of security and then also being asked to remedy those deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| I thought, well, possibly that might pose somewhat of a conflict, might be in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| You might need to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Plus the fact that if that is so, it seems that given the lawsuit that is pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| there also would be some legal considerations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| But anyway, I did want to start out with first the commendation about Ms. Ellis and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=597)|
| 0:10:08| If you have a statement that you would like to make, however you want to start this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| I'd like to give you that opportunity first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| And then if you could address a couple of those things, at least for me, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I appreciate the opportunity to address this really important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| I'd like to just make a brief sort of opening remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And then we have Sheriff Jones and Deputy Chief Holliday from KPD here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| They want to just say a brief word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| And then Chairman Carson would like to say a brief word as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| just by way of setting the context and introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Really, the first thing I want to say is, and you've probably heard me say this several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| is that the safety of our children and the security of our schools is our highest priority in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I reiterate that this afternoon because that's not a platitude or a throwaway line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| It's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| As a parent, as an educator, as the leader of our school system, I take very seriously my responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to keep our children safe in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| And I know the school board does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Let me just take a moment to summarize where we are in terms of school security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| and address some of the issues that have come up along the way and some of the public reports that have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| So I think to set the context, the Public Building Authority entered into a contract with a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| with a vendor, PSCD, to provide a security alarm system and video camera systems at Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| and at Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Deficiencies in that work were highlighted by an audit that was done in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| Working with the PBA, when that audit came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| we immediately addressed the life safety issues that were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| And that's primarily it identified some places where there were cutouts to the firewalls when that work was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| Those were addressed immediately, and we did make sure that our systems at those schools were functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| But to be clear, not all of the equipment or functionality that was promised in that contract between PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| and PSCD has been delivered at Hardin Valley Academy or at Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| And that's why there's litigation ongoing about that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| But the critical issues were addressed, and we have functioning security alarm systems, video camera systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| and fire protection systems at both Hardin Valley Academy and at Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| The systems are working, and those schools are indeed secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| Since those deficiencies were highlighted in 2011, the contract with PSCD has terminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| and an inspection and review of our security alarm systems in our schools was conducted last summer by our current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| well-respected vendor, Simplex Grinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| And any concerns were addressed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Simplex Grinnell also monitors our fire protection systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| and attests that those systems are functioning properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| It sends a daily test signal every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| And our fire protection systems are also inspected on an annual basis by the contractor Gallagher & Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| In addition to that, the Knox County Fire Marshal also inspects each of our schools biannually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| and we get inspection reports from the Fire Marshal in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| On a monthly basis, our security department does an assessment of our video camera systems to ensure that they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=818)|
| 0:13:47| and addresses any issues that may arise or any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| And our current vendor for video monitoring systems is a company called Systems Integration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| We have more than 2,000 video cameras operating in our school system, and as of Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| the best information that I have is that every single one of them is functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Based on these reviews and the regular tests and inspections that occur to our systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| I'm confident that our security alarm systems, our fire protection systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| our video camera systems are working properly, they're functioning appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and they're doing what they're supposed to do to help us keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| As Chairman Norman mentioned last night at the school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| the school board has requested an inspection and review of all of our security alarm systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| video camera systems, and keyless entry systems at each of our schools by Simplex Cornell over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And I'm confident that that inspection will inform, excuse me, will affirm the functionality of our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| But, you know, I think it's important to note that just having those systems functioning is simply not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| In light of what we saw in Connecticut in December, the Sandy Hook tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| and based on feedback that I've gotten from parents, from teachers, from community members, and from stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| I've publicly called for us to have at least a foundational level of security resources at each and every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| And that would include three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| A current generation video camera system at each of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| A school access control strategy at each of our schools, which means locked doors and a camera buzzer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| or a secure entry vestibule, or a keyless entry system at each of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| And thirdly, and I think this is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| I believe that we should have a uniformed armed school resource officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| or school security officer at each and every one of our schools in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| I think these strategies are critical to our efforts to keep our children safe in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| and I therefore believe that these resources should be appropriated in the Knox County schools fiscal year 14 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| And I hope that U.S. County commissioners will agree and fund these critical security investments for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| I did want to invite you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| We're having a community meeting on school safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| We scheduled this back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| It's scheduled for March 5th at 6 p.m. at Amherst Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I'd invite you to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| And I certainly want to acknowledge and thank the extraordinary partners that we have in our effort to keep our children safe in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| The Knox County Sheriff's Office and the Knoxville Police Department are incredible partners with us in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| We're going to continue to do everything in our power to keep our children safe in the Knox County schools each and every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| and I want to thank them for their partnership in doing that work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| At this time, I'd like to introduce Sheriff Jones and Deputy Chief Gary Holloway from the Knoxville Police Department just to give some brief remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1007)|
| 0:17:05| Jimmy Jones, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| I guess we'll do this first, and then if you have any other questions, you can ask, and we'll go through it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| First of all, I think the questions that we need to answer, are our schools safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| And I say certainly our schools are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Can our schools be safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Certainly they can be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| The ways we can make them safer is having an armed officer in each school, safe vestibules, buzzer system, keypad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| those types of things in the entryways, and also we need to upgrade to digital taping equipment in each one of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| I feel that those three things that Dr. McIntyre has introduced are three ways that we can make our schools safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| As you know, I have requested 20 officers, which would give me enough to put an officer in each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| I think at some point in time you'll see Dr. McIntyre also request for some school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| It doesn't particularly matter to me if it's my officers or his officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| but I do think there should be an armed officer in each and every school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| So that, I think we need to be working toward that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| I think also that maybe we've got a little off center on talking about the security in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1101)|
| 0:18:31| Even the two schools in question, I've talked to my officers that were at those schools when this dispute happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| They never felt that the schools were not secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| There were some differences and talked about the types of cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| and how many numbers of cameras were put in the school, but they never felt unsafe and they never felt threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| They always thought the schools were secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| The contract issues were different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| My officers don't know the difference between a wire being spliced or not spliced or a Kodak camera compared to a Nikon camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| There were a lot of different questions that they were asked to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Initially when this first started, Dr. McIntyre, Chief Roush, and myself got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| and decided what we could do to better look at the function of security in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| So what we asked our officers to do was to go into the schools and look and see if they thought anything was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| if anything wasn't working, if the security wasn't adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| They reported back to us, and I'll let Chief Holliday tell you what his officers reported, but they reported back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and there were some minor security issues, some minor security issues that have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| I don't think it's prudent for us to talk about those publicly, but if we want to talk about those individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| I will certainly talk with you about what we found, but they were minor safety issues, minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| and some of the concerns that they found were already being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| So I think that we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I think our schools are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Yes, I think they can be safer, and I think we've laid out the roadmap how to make them safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| Gary Holliday, Deputy Chief of Police, Knoxville, Tennessee, 800 Howard Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| I just want to echo what the sheriff said and Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| We have worked closely with Knox County Schools since the inception of our school resource officer program back in the late 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1230)|
| 0:20:40| We have 17 officers, 18 officers assigned to county schools within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| We have an excellent relationship with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| We have an excellent relationship with the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| and we work hand-in-hand to do our best to provide a safe environment for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| As the sheriff said, we undertook a safety survey of the schools, our school resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1260)|
| 0:21:09| Some of our crime prevention folks went out and looked at the schools inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| We did not find any glaring deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| We found things that could easily be remedied, and the superintendent has already addressed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| We will continue to work hand-in-hand with the sheriff's department and with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| As the superintendent moves forward with his plans to have an officer in every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| be it a sheriff's department officer or a school security officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I can tell you that the police department will continue to work and cooperate with whatever the decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1304)|
| 0:21:53| and we will provide training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| You may not be aware, but we had a 40-hour class for the school security officers prior to school starting this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| and it was very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| It was very effective, and that's something that we are willing to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| We feel like the schools inside the city are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| We will continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| What our officers did on their security survey was actually no different than what they do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| They check the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| They talk to the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| They talk to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| They look at the safety and security of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| and that's something that they do every day and something they will continue to do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| As the sheriff said, specifics from the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| probably not something that we'd want to sit and discuss in an open forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| because you don't want people to know what any of your perceived weaknesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| But if anyone would want to talk one-on-one personally to myself, I'd be available at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| We have ---- oh, you want to make a statement, Ms. Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1383)|
| 0:23:03| I do clean up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Karen Carson, 10953 Twin Harbor, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Again, thank you, commissioners, for giving us the opportunity to come and address this topic with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| I can tell you what I'm sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Building security in our schools is working and functioning as it's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| I think there has been a lot of focus in the past two weeks on school security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| and I think it's vital that we stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and make sure that people understand that security we're talking about is predominantly the security of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| when there are no kids in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| It's burglar alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| It's motion detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Those things aren't even on when our kids are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Those are important issues, but I feel very confident that they've been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| There is no doubt that we have old and new video equipment in the vast array.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| We have some schools that raise money to put video equipment in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| We have other schools that had pieces put in in different stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| So we have the age of our video monitoring equipment goes back to video cassettes up to digital equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| So there's no doubt in my mind that there is upgrading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| and a standard of what we expect in Knox County and all of our schools to be established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| and the board is working towards doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| What I want to, though, say is we hope to address any concerns you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| and then I think it's vital that we acknowledge that our world has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| When Columbine happened, the world as we looked at it related to schools and security changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| and there were many changes instituted post-Columbine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| 9-11 created many changes in our world in how we deal with security issues go to any airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| I think Sandy Hook will cause the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| We are trying to look at how do we make sure that every child that is in every school under our care is as safe as they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1501)|
| 0:25:13| Those are the questions that I wish to see the superintendent and his staff and the police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| and the sheriff's department and the Board of Ed and the County Commission focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| I don't want to hide from anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| I just want to get any questions we have out in the open dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| and then let's focus on how do we keep our kids as safe as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I think it's just the most important question and the most pressing one today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| as we find out what really happened at Sandy Hook and then what can we institute to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| The only other thing I'll add in just, I guess, a first shot at your question, Commissioner Norman, is Simplex Grinnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1547)|
| 0:25:57| You know, the way the board has looked at this issue, Simplex Grinnell is an outside contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| There are no Knoxville, Knox County employees, school employees that will be doing those inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| If it were the only source, I might say, well, maybe we should get an outside contractor for the outside contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| But we have so many other outside components that are looking at different security issues throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| on a regular maintenance basis that I feel confident that what we're going to find is what is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| If I didn't have the ability to say to the police chief or the sheriff, tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| get your folks that are out there to do a quick inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| No notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| And they're there all the time so that they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| So that's outside eyes looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| The fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| There's a list of regular groups that come in outside and look at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| It's not one that I'll go to battle for, but going with Simplex Grinnell from the board's perspective was we already have a contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1617)|
| 0:27:06| They are an outside agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| They've had no investment in telling us that everything's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Anything that needs to be fixed, we have to pay them to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| So, you know, they've got more of an investment in finding things that are wrong to get fixed for us and for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1634)|
| 0:27:23| It's also something that we can do quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| You know, if we're really concerned that the buildings aren't secure, do we want to go through a bid process to have an outside group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| come in and we know that we want to do some schools quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| We know that we cannot do them during school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| So it has to be done in evenings and weekends and then the vast majority addressed during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| You understand my concern, though, in terms of how I expressed it was that if you ask Simplex Grinnell to find your deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1667)|
| 0:27:56| and you also ask them to remedy those deficiencies, there seems to be a bit of a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| That's your all's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| That's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| I'm just saying I thought it would have been in several things that it might have been a better idea to have a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| involved in the discovery process rather than, you know, that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| But that's your all's decision, and if it's made, it's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| If you can reconsider or if it's still possible to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| it might be wise also from the legal standpoint as far as the lawsuit going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| I don't know how that would be challenged, but lawyers find interesting ways to reinterpret things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| And that, I think, is a different issue, and the Board did talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| If, you know, again, it's what purpose are we trying to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| If we are trying to serve the purpose to find does the equipment that is in the schools is functioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| I am confident that Simplex Grinnell can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Now, if we want to go in and see did PSCD install every piece of equipment in those schools to the specifications over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1739)|
| 0:29:08| past whatever many years, and for the purpose of maybe entering in that lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and recouping some money back, that's a whole different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| I have no problem with somebody outside doing it, but I guess I would say what is the return on investment going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| My interest right now is are the buildings secure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Does the equipment function as it's meant to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| And then we're just all here for questions for whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| We've got at least four of us who want to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Mr. Smith, you're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Dr. McIntyre, a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Did you say that you've gone through and you've looked at all the systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Did I hear you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| So, last summer, Simplex Grinnell, as they took over the contract in 2011, last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| they did a review and inspection of all of the security alarm systems and components of those systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| and provided reports to us on their functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| If they found any issues that needed to be addressed, we addressed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| I'm going to take the lead what J.J. said and the other officer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| I happened to stop by one of the schools today, and I didn't bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| The administration brought it up and the school officer brought it up that they are nowhere near where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| And I don't want to say that publicly, but I'm going to you and I will get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and I'll tell you where that is so you all can sort of go where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And we've had problems before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Yeah, and I think, you know, as you heard me say earlier, I think there are some important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| First of all, I think there's a lot of really important strategies that we've put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| over the years in partnership with the KPD and the Sheriff's Office to really focus on school safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| You know, things like our threat assessment protocol, things like we do random searches for dangerous weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| things like an anonymous text tip line that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| And so, you know, we've put in place a number of important strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| but I do believe there are three really important strategies given what's happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| And I think Ms. Carson's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I think the perspective on school safety and security has changed radically in the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| because of what our country experienced in that awful tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| And I think having a current generation video system, school access control strategy at every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| and an armed officer at every school is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| And I think those are three really important strategies for us to put in place at every single school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| Well, I'll get with you and tell you the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| You're doing a survey, I think a sample survey, I think some 23 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| They specifically said put us in that mix if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| We're going to do the review and inspection that Simplex Grinnell is going to do is going to look at every single school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| We're going to do two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| We're going to do 27 schools in the next few weeks, and then we're going to do the rest of our schools again this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| And that's looking at the security alarm systems, the video camera systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and the keyless entry systems in each and every one of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| I'll just pass that on to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| And thank you for your --I'm confident you're going to get to the bottom of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Okay, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Yeah, Superintendent, I think it's important that we not only look at what Ms. Carson was speaking of, the hard security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| but we've got to really address best practice management for our whole security system within our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| I think we found some flaws, and I think that we need to make sure that it's not just focused on the hard line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| It's really focused on systems and the makeup of how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And if we're doing the best with what we can do with our money based on what other systems find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| other school systems find more practical or better case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Yeah, I won't say too much to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Commissioner Andrews is kind of where I was pointing to where I was wanting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| And that was, you know, I know we need to act quickly and swiftly, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| sometime it may, you know, prove to move out a little slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| And it's, I guess what concerns me is Commissioner Norman's issue is common mode failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| I mean, when you have a company that's good at this, that's what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| So if they're the same company that's looking at it and making a fix, maybe there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| something that slips by with our haste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| I won't say haste, but with our urgency to, you know, assure the public that we're doing all that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| So, you know, we're, thank goodness, we're behind the eight ball on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| We haven't had the events that maybe a larger city, a more crime-ridden school system would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2039)|
| 0:34:10| in terms of security and securing our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| So have we looked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I guess my question is, have we talked with some of the other school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| that may have, you know, be a little further ahead of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Again, this is a good thing, but actually a little further ahead of us in terms of their recording capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| their entry processes, and see what companies they've engaged with and are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| And have we done any of those things, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| And, Commissioner, I would say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| One, we've actually had, you know, we've had two school shootings in our schools in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| So in each of those, after each of those incidents, we really brought, the Board of Education brought together a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| of experts from here locally and around the country, including the National School Safety Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| to talk about our protocols, our procedures, our strategies that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And, you know, out of that grew things like the text tip line and the random searches for dangerous weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| And we've now put locking mechanisms on all of our classroom doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| And this is a three-year effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| It's been in the budget in each of the last three years in the capital budget to put locking mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| on each of our classroom doors so they can lock from the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| But I think, you know, certainly as we, what the Board of Education really charged me with doing last night was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| really looking at some standards and practices around the country and here locally for things like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| video monitoring systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| What's, you know, what is the state of the art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| What is a reasonable standard to set to make sure that we have those systems in all of our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| And I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| And I would also say that we benefit from the extraordinary partnership that we have with the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| and the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I haven't seen anything like it anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| We have a written memorandum of understanding about how we collaborate and how we communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| And that communication is daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| That is an exchange of information on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| They're in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| You know, their officers are in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| They're providing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| They're providing that safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And that dialogue is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| But I think certainly, you know, I'm going to reach out to Mike Herman, who's at the State Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| around safety services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I'll reach back out to the National School Safety Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| And, you know, this is a dialogue that, again, has been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Prior to this information coming up in the last few weeks, the Sheriff and Chief Rausch and I were at the Tennessee State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| School Safety Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| So it's going to be an ongoing dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| We're going to do everything that we can to make sure that our strategies and protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and procedures really are where they need to be to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| But I think those three strategies that are outlined are absolutely critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| And those are our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Let me first of all say that I do not doubt for a moment your commitment to the safety of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| and the security of our buildings or the school board or anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I think that it's top-of-mind awareness, and I just wanted you to know that I don't know of anyone that's questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| at all your commitment to the safety of our kids and to securing our buildings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I guess I want to address two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| First, and I know you probably can't say a lot about it, but the relationship of the head of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| with the awarding of the PSCD contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Whether it occurred or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| the appearance is that you have someone who influenced a decision based upon family ties and perhaps gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2265)|
| 0:37:55| Again, that may not be the case, but that is certainly an impression that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| What are we doing in the future to make sure that when we award contracts that if there is some type of relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| that it is properly noticed or properly that you know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| and also that if someone has received gifts or if they have received something, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| to me this would violate the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| But I'm just wondering, moving forward, what is being done to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| You know, I think, Commissioner, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| It's a great question, and I think it's an important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Of course, the relationship between Mr. Griffin and PSCD is under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| We've engaged Attorney Ruth Ellis to look at that on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| and we'll look for, you know, we'll certainly see where that investigation goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| and what her findings are and take appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| I would say in terms of looking at that issue, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| I actually think that some of the work that the Knox County Audit Department is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| is actually going to be instructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| We have, you know, I think some of the work that they've done is over the last few weeks and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| they've been looking at the ethics policies and practices around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| around the county and around Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| And I think tightening up around conflict of interest protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| and training I think would probably be useful, you know, for all of us across the board in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| And I think probably in all areas of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| So I think those are some things that we'll, from a policy perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| the Board of Education will want to take a look at and make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| we are very clear about our protocols and our procedures in terms of conflict of interest disclosure and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| And so I think there's going to be some information coming out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| the work that the Audit Department has been doing that will be helpful to us in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| I know that you're working on the plan for additional officers and for increased security at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| You are planning on bringing this forward as part of your budget presentation for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| Yes, sir, I am, for fiscal year 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| And I think there are likely to be components that are capital components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| You know, some of the school access control strategies are more capital type of expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| as is the video camera systems are potential capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| And then, obviously, the officers would be more on the personnel side, on the operating side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| How long do you think it would take to get these improvements implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| We could probably hire people, but they have to go through a training process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| But the capital improvements will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Have you, and you may not know, but I'm just wondering how long will it take to implement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Well, that's what we're working through now as we develop a proposal for the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| You know, I think that's really what we're looking at is what would look like, where do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| at which schools would we employ, which strategies, what would it cost, and what would be the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| So I anticipate as we begin the discussion of the capital budget, we'll have those details and work plan laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| And I look forward to having these discussions to echo what Ms. Carson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| We're in a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Like it or not, our world has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| And I think we have to adapt to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| And I, for one, am ready to make the necessary changes that we need to adapt to it because I think we're all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| The security of kids are priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| And whatever we need to do, I think we've got to take a hard look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| You mentioned a while ago that last summer that Simplex Grinnell did an assessment of all of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2501)|
| 0:41:50| How come these deficiencies were not found then when they did that assessment that we're finding now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| Commissioner, that was the summer of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| The audit that was done at Hardin Valley Academy and Powell Middle School was actually done in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Who is the security chief for school system now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| Rodney Beverly, who is deputy chief, is acting chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Was he not supposed to divest himself of his security company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| My understanding from conversations with Acting Chief Beverly is that he had a security company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| that was a private company that he did outside of that he managed outside of work hours and outside of work resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| And that that company became defunct somewhere around 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| Well, I had a friend of mine tell me yesterday his son got a W-2 from his security firm for last year's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| And I'm just wondering, you know, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| Well, if you have additional information, I'm glad to hear that from you and look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| You mentioned the 40-hour training while I go for the security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Would these be like police cadets that might move up the line or are you going out on the street and hire these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2601)|
| 0:43:30| It was actually Deputy Chief Holliday that mentioned it, so I'd love to have him come down and talk about the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| Well, you talked about your --I thought you mentioned you had a special training program for your security officers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2615)|
| 0:43:44| I think Deputy Chief Holliday talked about that, the 40 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| And, I mean, you know, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| I mean, I think he'd be better to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I can talk about it, but he's the expert on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| Commissioners, my understanding is the school security folks are armed security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2639)|
| 0:44:09| and which is different than your post-certified police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| The training is different and the requirements are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| What we did is, as our school resource officers work with these folks in the city schools on a day-to-day basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| we wanted to develop a tactical partnership with them to be sure that our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2665)|
| 0:44:35| and their folks kind of sang off the same sheet of music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| So we brought them in and we did 40 hours of tactical work, defensive tactics work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| We have a shoot house at our range, so we would put the school security officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| and our police officer in and let them work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| We were just trying to build partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| That is something that is separate from their actual initial training as school security officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| but it's something that we will continue to offer on a yearly basis just so we can help the school system be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| that they get the best trained folks that they can possibly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Well, I guess this probably would be for you and J.J. together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| J.J. says he needs 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I don't remember you mentioning a number that you might be needing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| but will these all be trained together under the same program or, J.J., are yours going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2721)|
| 0:45:32| The 20 that I ask for would be trained academy police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Yes, just like our officers on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And just to echo what Chief Holliday said, we also do active shooter training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and we do defensive tactics and we do firearms with school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| So they receive training from both the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and the Knox County Sheriff's Office, and we would continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| One other quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| For the school security officers, what weapons would they carry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| You said armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| I'm wondering the arms that they would --- tasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| I mean, just anything that they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| Rodney Beverly, acting chief of Knox County School of Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Our officers will carry 40 Glocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| And will they have tasers and this type of thing as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Do they use frangible bullets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Do they use frangible ammunition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| We use ammunition that does not go through any person as far as what we train with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2807)|
| 0:46:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, Chief Holliday, Sheriff Jones, Ms. Carson, for coming today and helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2822)|
| 0:47:11| Of course, this is no tribunal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| We're not here to make any kind of judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| There are, in these types of presentations, sometimes there is a little bit of a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| a feeling of sanitation, a little bit of what's been taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2846)|
| 0:47:35| And several of us have read possibly the Stancil Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| And there are, these are reports which delineate some very serious omissions and transgressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2860)|
| 0:47:52| in terms of how equipment is used, the type of equipment that is used, how it's employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| And so I don't want, I mean, in our, I guess, haste to try to assure the public that we're not in serious security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2881)|
| 0:48:15| in some serious security issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| There still are serious, serious issues that have been reported and documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| So, and then that, along with the fact that we have a very high-level person in the administration of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2904)|
| 0:48:35| which has made, and this may yet to be proven, has influenced contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| or bids or the execution of those contracts, that is a very serious accusation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| And I'm sure Ms. Ellis is going to, she's going to report on these in a way that will be satisfactory to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2929)|
| 0:48:59| But I do thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I had Mr. Hill, I saw your hand go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| Are you, we don't have public forum right now, so if you'd like to speak later, that'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| But we need to go back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| Plus I skipped something that I shouldn't have just a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| So in my haste to get on to the agenda, by the way, we didn't approve the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| So could I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2973)|

| 0:49:35| Opposed, ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| On page six, item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| This is a resolution approving the three-year notice of grant award in the amount of $602,846| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for promoting safer sex in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| the PSST Project Resolution 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Is Dr. Buchanan, I saw her earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Someone from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| I don't know if she can hear me or not, but just had a constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| I'll wait on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Come on up, Doc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Just had a constituent send me an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Just, you know, I'm sure reading the blurb and not going into detail, just had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3034)|
| 0:50:43| at our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| One, I assured him that these are pass-through dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| and we're not spending any county resources on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| but could you just quickly kind of give a rundown on what these funds are used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| We're talking about the PSST grant, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Marcia Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| These funds are used to administer an evidence-based program out of the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| and Human Services Department to do one-on-one counseling with young women who are seeking either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| contraception or health care and have questions about what contraception is appropriate for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| And we'll talk about a range of options for contraception, everything from abstinence to birth control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| and all the methods of birth control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| So it's one-on-one counseling in an evidence-based program that people refer into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| and the counselors see the young ladies on a one-on-one basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3106)|

| 0:51:49| Any other questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| On page eight, item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| This is a resolution approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $2,500 with Brandon Scott Walker for the surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| property located 323 Merrifield Park, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| And all I want to do is to put this back on was to give proper acknowledgement to Miss Rebecca Gibson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| in Knox County here that's been working very hard on properties and processes, transfers, all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| and has obviously developed some new ways of finding ways for us to get these properties back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| So she is apparently the brains behind this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| Possibly also, I think, Miss Benton in the trustee's office whom I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| I do know Miss Gibson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| but we wanted to at least acknowledge them for their work and their diligence in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| On page nine, item number 35, this is a resolution expressing support of Senate Bill 748,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| House Bill 420 to permit beginning with elections of school board members in 2014 county government bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| by two-thirds vote to choose to elect county board members on a partisan rather than a nonpartisan basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Before we start this, I would like to remind the body that we're going to recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| and reform at three o'clock for the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| So we can go ahead with this, but we need to keep an eye possibly on our time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| So this afternoon, yes, city council and we have a workshop or an education committee right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3242)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Mr. Chairman, I would like to put a friendly amendment to that that we also make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| We need to get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I'd like to put a friendly amendment with this that they also be term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| Is it against state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| I've checked with the law director because it's going to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| It's against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| If the state legislature does it, it's not against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| What a court has opined that the term limits in the charter do not apply to school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3288)|
| 0:54:57| but the state legislature certainly has the power to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| I guess the point of order, I mean, we're going to vote on something today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I'd like to see those words before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| I mean, there's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| That's a pretty substantial change to what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| So that's not, in my opinion, not just kind of a friendly little tag on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| I think it's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Mr. Wright, let me acknowledge Mr. Wright now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Unless Commissioner Smith was wanting to hold the floor for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Well, my only thought was when you talk about this issue and you speak about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| and what people have talked in the community is, you know, if they want to talk about partisan rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| But when you also say to go ahead and term limit it, everybody else is pretty much term limited also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| So, you know, the two seem to go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3354)|
| 0:56:03| You want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| Recognizing what you said just a second ago that we have several things in front of us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| In fact, we're just minutes, moments away from the Finance Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| And I'm in agreement with Commissioner McKenzie that this may be a significant change in the resolution that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| I would offer a substitute motion that this be passed on to full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I'd like to echo what Commissioner Wright said and support the substitute motion for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| I have talked with Representative Haynes about this term limit at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| He has told me that he and Representative Brooks could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| and probably will ask for a state attorney general's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Given the lawsuit that we went through and the notice about the judiciary in the schools, there is that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| And I appreciate our law director's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I would also like to, if they're going to get that attorney general's opinion, I'd like to have that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| So I want to echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I'd like to support sending it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| And let's take a look at it a little closer because this has a lot of ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| and I think we need to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| And we still have the term limit amendment, friendly amendment, which was acceptable to the second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3446)|
| 0:57:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| So we don't we the second has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| So we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| I'd like to make a motion, a first motion to make it pass through without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| The original resolution to pass through without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| It's in force right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| All in favor say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Draw the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| So we have a second to the original resolution and motion that it be sent without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Any other discussion to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| We're going to recess right now and reconvene as finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Is that okay if we go right ahead into the next one in terms of elected superintendents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Could I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Move to full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Now, without objection, we'll move into this finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| And could I hear a the first order of business in this meeting is to constitute the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| We have to elect officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| So we need a nomination for chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| I have a nomination of Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| I'd love to, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| I'd like to nominate Ed Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| You know to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| That's okay, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| That's maybe the best way to get him elected is that he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| We have a nomination of Mr. Shouse for chair of the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Seeing none, we could elect him by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Could I hear nominations for vice chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Sam, could you do vice chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| That would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Any other nominations for vice chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Seeing none, by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Could I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| So, Mr. McKenzie, you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| You know, for as much as it is, I don't mind legislating or chairing from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| And just by suggestion, I did ask Mr. Owenby if he would be willing to serve as secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| But that's your call, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| If Commissioner Owenby is okay with that, I guess I would appoint him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| In the absence of our chair as the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| I think we have two things on our remaining on the agenda as reported by the county law director regarding the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3653)|
| 1:01:03| of the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I'll make it as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| And I do have a summary that we can get to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| There are several duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| One statutory and the rest set out in the ordinance as to what the finance committee for Knox County is to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| The first is statutory, TCA 49-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| It sets out a duty of the county legislative body to require the county board of education through the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| to make quarterly reports of the receipts and expenditures of the public school funds, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| The needs of the county elementary and county high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And number three, the progress that the schools have made in their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| and other information as to the administration of the public schools that you as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| or since it's a commission sitting as a committee may from time to time require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| This is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| It's set out and it is your overriding duty under statute for the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| The second part of that statute says that you require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| the commission requires its finance committee to examine the accounts of the county board of education quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| or at any other time it may appear that the county board is misusing any of the public school funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| or exceeding its budget as adopted by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| And you also may have authority to appoint an auditor at the expense of the county to accomplish that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3755)|
| 1:02:45| if this committee deems it necessary and recommends it to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| That's duty number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| The other duties of the finance committee are set out in the Knox County Code, section 2-203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| It relates to emergency expenditures that should come through this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| and then be recommended if need be to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Of course, the county commission is the only body that can sit and approve any expenditure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| whether it's emergency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| So you can sit there and always convene as a finance committee to make that recommendation to yourself sitting as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3799)|
| 1:03:28| There's a procedure for appropriation of pass-through funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| We've already done one of those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| With the health department, the finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| and the full commission shall be given a report as to all the pass-through funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| which come through and make sure that they are applied when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| that they are applied to the specific purpose, just like Dr. Buchanan's pass-through funds today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| It would be your duty to ascertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| and make sure that those are expended accordingly, which I think would come from Chris Caldwell's office anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| The third thing is under Code, section 2-554.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| It provides that amendments to line items within a major category other than the budget of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| may be made by a majority vote of the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| However, that section is a little bit ambivalent because clearly under law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| and under a charter a committee has no authority in and of itself to approve a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| The commission certainly does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| So basically if this finance committee, sitting as a finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| recommends to this committee sitting as a commission to amend the budget, then certainly that power is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| I just point that out because it would seem to give the authority to the finance committee to make a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| The next item is under 2-613, which provides that any additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| deletions or other modifications to the procurement code shall be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| and approved by the finance committee prior to submitting it to the full sitting commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| And, of course, the full sitting commission, since the procurement code is by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| it's also provided for under state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| but any changes would technically come through this committee going on to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| The last item is under County Code 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| Excuse me, not the next one, the next to last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| County Code 58-39 refers to how we spend our money under the amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3949)|
| 1:05:59| And this committee must approve any change or application for a person requesting any receipts of funds from the amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| The companion ordinance falls under 58-92, which is request for appropriation from the hotel occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3967)|
| 1:06:18| These don't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| They are in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| They may be a little bit superfluous because this body, this finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| the commission is sitting as a whole on this finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| The key ones are under emergency expenditures I referenced at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| And, of course, the finance committee's duty to get quarterly reports from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=3994)|
| 1:06:44| Thank you, Mr. Slaughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| I guess one question is, is there a threshold on that emergency expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| I'm sorry, is there what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Threshold, a dollar threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| No, I don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Well, I can look it up while you're discussing it otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| But the emergency expenditure provision is provided for in the code, and it's defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| It generally follows state law and provides that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| if we have a FEMA type of flood or something, that you've got to get something done immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| And that's what the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| There's no threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| It's just whether or not this body feels that monies need to be appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| From this vantage point, I can't see a lot of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| So are there any lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Anyone want to make a comment on the law director's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| If not, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Does that mean that the Finance Committee needs to meet before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| From a procedural standpoint, if you have items on the agenda that need to be taken up by the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| does the Finance Committee need to be first and then we meet as a regular commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| I'm just wondering about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I think procedurally you're correct, Commissioner, that that's the way it would have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| And then I guess the other thing that I heard a lot of it say is that this next item, this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| it's actually a report by the school board delivered by the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Well, it says, what it says specifically is that the county director of schools shall make the report in the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4104)|
| 1:08:33| And then the second part is for this committee to examine the accounts of the Board of Education quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| It doesn't say who would present that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| The first one is that the county director of schools makes a quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| So, Dr. McIntyre, I'm going to move to the next agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| and have a financial report by our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4133)|
| 1:09:05| Thank you, Chairman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| You have being handed out to you our sort of proposed structure on what a quarterly financial report would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| from Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| And what I'd like to do is take a few minutes just to walk you through what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| and where we're at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Basically, this is an update for fiscal year 2013, the current fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| as of the quarter ending December 31, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| And there is essentially two components to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| One is a look at revenues and the other is a look at expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| And to look at those dynamics as of the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| And so I'll walk you through it and highlight a couple of dynamics that may be of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| And then also, you know, I would love to get your feedback on if this is the type of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| that would be useful to you on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So I would start with page two of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| It's labeled page two at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| And that is a comparative statement of revenues as of December 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| And I think what you'll see here is the way we've structured this is a look at revenues as of December 31, 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| and comparing it to a look at revenues as of December 31, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| So you get a year-over-year perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| When we look at revenues for Knox County Schools, there are three areas that are really make up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| bulk of the revenues that we see for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| The first, of course, is property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| The second is local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| And the third would be the basic education program, or BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| which is state aid to support public education in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| What you'll see is that in terms of property taxes, we have seen collections as of the end of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| of approximately $59.1 million against a budget of $113.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4268)|
| 1:11:17| We're representing about 52 percent of collected of the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| I'll turn your attention to the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| You see there that we have seen collections of $83.5 million on a budget of $167 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4286)|
| 1:11:38| And that's approximately collections of 50 percent of our basic education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| So those are two areas where you're seeing roughly half of the budgeted amounts have been collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Six months into the fiscal year, you're seeing roughly half, and I think that's a good place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| I'll call your attention to the local option sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| where we see $34.9 million collected against a budget of $106 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| And what you see there is that shows collections in relationship to budget of approximately 33 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| So about a third of our sales tax has been collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| And I certainly defer to Mr. Caldwell on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| but my understanding is that our collections of sales tax are sort of reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| and posted roughly two months, you know, behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| So as of December 31st, we would have posted, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| probably through October or thereabouts in terms of the collections of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| So as we look at this, and I'll talk about projected revenues in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| As we look at this, you know, one of the most important months for sales tax collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| obviously, is in December when there's lots of holiday spending and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| And so this, as of December 31st, this look does not actually capture that sales tax yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| We'll probably see that in actually the next few days or weeks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| We'll really reflect that level of revenues coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| At the bottom, there's sort of a summary of estimated revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| And what you see is that the revenue estimate for fiscal year 13 is $402.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4392)|
| 1:13:22| I would add that if you see the line just above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| if you see a little bit down the bottom of that page, you see a summary of those dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| And you'll see that $4.3 million comes from fund balance for fiscal year 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| So what you see is if you add the $402.2 million and the $4.3 million from fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4415)|
| 1:13:44| you'll get roughly $406 million, which is our fiscal year 13 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| And you'll see that on the expenditure side in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| Overall, at this point in time, we, in terms of total revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| we see collections of $185.5 million against a revenue budget of $402.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| That represents roughly 46 percent of collections versus budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| And, again, that's right in line with about where we are in the school year, in the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| and also where we are in terms of where we were this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| So, you know, in terms of revenues, it looks like we're moving in a good direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| On the next page, Page 3, you'll see our projections of revenues for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| And we use several different methodologies to project revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| And you'll see that we have a weighted average trend, a prior year trend projection, a 12-year average trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| which brings in historical data, a conservative or minimum trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| And that actually looks at sort of a worst-case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| What if, you know, some of the worst months in collections that we've seen over the last few years were the standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| That gives us sort of a worst-case scenario type of trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| And then a composite trend, which takes the information from each of those methodologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and integrates it together into a single trend line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| What you see on this sheet is that based on those several different projection methodologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| we started off the year, the fiscal year, with projections that were looking at a potential deficit in terms of revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4522)|
| 1:15:31| versus our budget, that the collections at that point were projected to be under what we had budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| But in the last few months, that projection, those projections have become more positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| We've seen that trend improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| And so right now what you're seeing is that four out of the five methodologies that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| including the composite trend, are showing a potential surplus in revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| meaning that at the end of the year we would have collected revenues that exceed the budget in terms of what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| budgeted for revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| The only trend that does not show that is the conservative minimum trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| And so we're comfortable that that's moving in a very positive direction and that we're likely to end the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| with collections that are of revenues that are either on budget or exceed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| So that's some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| And we hope that that trend continues over the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| I do think that the next month will really tell the tale in a lot of ways around revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| looking at what the December sales tax collections were versus last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| and also looking at property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| As you know, this is a big month for property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| And so I think the next time we meet quarterly on this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| we'll have a much better picture of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| of where we expect to end the fiscal year in terms of these trends for revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4609)|
| 1:16:58| And, again, the composite trend shows just a slight, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| shows an estimate of just a slight positive outcome in terms of revenues of about $324,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4623)|
| 1:17:14| So $324,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| So that's, again, we think that's a positive development over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| As I turn to expenditures on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| this outlines our major categories of expenditures and where we are in terms of, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| looking at where we were a year ago on December 31, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| where we were in fiscal year 13 as of December 31, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| and what percentage of our dollars have been spent or encumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| I think that's important to note that there are some encumbrances in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| which means the dollars have been obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| They haven't necessarily been paid out yet, but they have been obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| So it's important to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| And as we look down the line, you see that, you know, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| we are where you might expect us to be in terms of spending over this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| You see that we do have a couple of dynamics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| We are, again, you have to be looking at the timing in terms of both our fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| and our school year and recognize that we're, as of this point in time, as of December 31, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| we would have been, you know, six months into the fiscal year, but four months into the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| And so you see some trends that reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| So a lot of the spending levels are somewhere between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| between 30 or 40 and 50 percent spent, and that's about where you'd expect us to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| On some of the personnel line items, you see that we might be on the lower end, around a third spent or 40 percent spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| And, again, that's probably pretty well in line with where we should be because when we look at teacher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| teacher salaries are basically earned over school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| They're earned from when school starts through the end of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| but they're paid typically over the summer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| So payrolls for July and for June and July are actually charged back to fiscal year 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| even though some of that spending occurs in fiscal year 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| So when you look at it from a payroll perspective, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| we're really about four months out of 12 months into the fiscal year in terms of that dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| So it's important to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| I think there's a couple of items that may be useful just to give some additional information about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| I assume you'll probably ask about them if I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| So I think the first one is where it says General Administration Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| and it says the budget is roughly $6.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| That's not the stipends for the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| That would be a little bit high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| But there are a variety of different spending categories that fall within the budget for the Board of Education Cost Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4805)|
| 1:20:15| And those would include things like contracted services for our Student Activities Fund audit, workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4815)|
| 1:20:23| That's probably a pretty significant area of spending within that budget line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| General liability claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| A big one in that, well, there's two others, space costs for the AGA building and Knox Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| But a big one in that category of Board of Education would be the trustees' commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| So that comes out of that line item as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| So I think that gives you a better sense of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| In terms of the Office of the Superintendent, that includes my office and the Office of the Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| It includes our Family and Community Engagement Unit as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| folks who are working to actively engage parents and our families and communities in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| It also includes postage, actually, for the school district is in that line item as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| So that's a little bit of a breakdown on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| You might ask what Office of the Principal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| And I think that's, you know, it's under this header of General Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| That may be a bit of a misnomer because that's really the Office of the Principal obviously resides in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| And so that is the salaries of our principals, our assistant principals, our school secretaries and bookkeepers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| and then all of our things like photocopy services, telecommunications, and things of that nature in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| So, again, that's an area where you see a variety of different types of expenditures sort of lumped into one particular category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4901)|
| 1:21:50| And as you go down, I also would highlight that if you look at under fund balance designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| you see that we have approximately $20 million designated from fund balance for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4915)|
| 1:22:04| You'll see that that is in terms of encumbrances and obligations, it's 94 percent encumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| And that's not to say all those dollars have been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| For example, when we're looking at things like a major addition renovation at Pond Gap and in Shannondale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| those dollars have been encumbered by moving them from fund balance into the school construction fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| where they'll be spent for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| And if you look down the bottom, you can see a breakdown of what those fund balance designations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| And those have been obviously discussed publicly, approved by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| and affirmed by this body at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| A good chunk of that are the facility upgrades, textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| The E-rate line item is an investment in actually in technology infrastructure that leverages federal resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4968)|
| 1:22:58| And oftentimes we are reimbursed by the federal government at a rate of 60 percent or higher for those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| So for every, you know, 40 cents we spend, the federal government will kick in another 60 cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| on doing those types of infrastructure upgrades for technology at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| So it's a really good investment and it's a necessary one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| but it's a great way to leverage some available federal dollars in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| You see science lab upgrades and the like within the fund balance designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| That's the financial report, and I'm glad to entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| And Ron McPherson, our finance director, and Bob Thomas, our assistant superintendent for administration, are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| They can dig into the details with you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| But I also, you know, recognize that perhaps part of the obligation is to really talk about where we are as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| and where we want to go and what we're looking forward to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| And certainly I know many of you were at the State of the Schools Address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| So, you know, I don't want to give you the whole 51-minute speech again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| but I do want to just highlight some quick thoughts about where we are and where we'd like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5045)|
| 1:24:12| The first is that when you look at the important changes that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| and reforms that have been put in place and really all of the strategies that we have employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| in terms of meeting our goal of excellence for all children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| what you're beginning to see really is that focus on high-quality instruction and supporting our human capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| and focusing on the needs of our students is really beginning to yield some educational dividends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| some of those important investments that we have made with your support over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| And so by virtually every quantifiable indicator of student learning and success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| we're seeing strong progress being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| Our TCAP scores are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Our TVAS scores, which is student academic growth, are very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| Our high school graduation rate edged over 90% for the class of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| It's at 90.3%, which I think is remarkable and important, a really important improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| And at the same time, we saw an improvement in our ACT scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| We've gone from 20.4 to 20.6 in terms of our overall composite ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| So we're making strong academic progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| and I think that that's reflected in the student outcomes that we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| And I think that's a testament to the Board of Education having defined a very clear strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| and our executing against that and making all of our educational resources aligned to our educational mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| And, of course, I think that's a testament to the support that we've had from the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| and allowing that to happen through the appropriations that you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| As I think about where we go for the future in terms of additional investments and where we need to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| I do think there are four areas that I'd like to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| and talk about in terms of the fiscal year 14 budget and where we need to go for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| The first is the Board of Education approved and the County Commission, thankfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| and we're grateful for it, appropriated an additional $7 million over natural revenue growth this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| And I think there were some really important investments in that $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| There's a focus on early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| There were interventions and enrichment for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| There was a teacher support component that I think was really important around professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| and more lead teachers and instructional coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| and then some additional resources for magnet and community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| And I think those are really important investments that I think they're a big part of why we're seeing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| of the strong academic progress that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| And I think that's incredibly important for us to maintain those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| and maybe even enhance some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| So that would be the first area would be really to focus on some of those instructional investments that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| in the classroom with those $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| The second area would be around educator compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| And we certainly have had that conversation with the County Commission over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| You know, last year spoke a lot about the fact that our average teacher salary is 37th in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| in terms of when you look at compare us to other school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| That's not where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| And, in fact, it has really a deleterious effect on our ability to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| Even here in our region, we see some of our very best teachers will go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| take a job at Oak Ridge or Maryville or Ocoa and right away with, you know, an extra 10-minute drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| they'll make an extra $8,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| And I think that's, you know, that's an area where we really do need to make some progress in becoming competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| and making sure that our educator salaries are competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I think we made some progress this year with the dawn of our strategic compensation initiative, which is APEX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| And, as you know, from federal grant sources, we paid out about $3.6 million to teachers this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| teachers and school leaders this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| It's about 2,100 educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| About 59 percent of our teacher force met the really high standards that we defined for that performance pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| And I'd like to be able to sustain that and maybe even enhance that strategic compensation component of teacher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| But I also think we need to make some progress on our base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| And I think that would be important for us to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| So that's the second area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| So it would be educator compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| The third area we talked a lot about earlier is school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| And I talked about the three areas where I think we have to make some investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| and make sure that we have current generation video systems, a school access control strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and an officer at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| And I've talked a lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| The final area is the fourth area would be instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| And, again, that was a topic of conversation last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| I thought that was we had a very robust and healthy conversation, I think, about our budget last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| And technology was a component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| And I think the approach that we're going to take this year is to really start small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| You know, last year we kind of proposed a pretty comprehensive technology strategy for all of our schools right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| And I think that this year the approach is going to be a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| What we're going to do is start small, think about implementing a one-to-one initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| in instructional technology, and that's one device per one student or one teacher in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| And to implement that one-to-one instructional technology strategy in about 10 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| And in order to identify those 10 schools, we're actually beginning an internal competition for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| We've sent out a sort of an application to our schools for them to send back to us to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5381)|
| 1:29:49| if I were going to be given a level of technology infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| and hardware and training and support, what would that look like and how would I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| And to identify the schools where they have the capacity and the passion and enthusiasm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| and excitement and ability to implement instructional technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| in a way that's really going to have an impact on student learning and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| So we're in the process of doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| We just had a webinar to provide technical assistance to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| We had over 50 schools that participated in that webinar to get more information about this application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| And then we'll identify 10 schools really across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| I anticipate it will be elementary, middle schools, and high schools, and geographically across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| And make that part of our budget proposal to fund a comprehensive one-to-one instructional technology initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5433)|
| 1:30:42| in each of those 10 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| And again, start small, demonstrate some success so folks can see in their community a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| where that technology is making a difference in student learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| and build some capacity and learn some lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| and hopefully also create some demand for that level of instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| So those are the four areas, the instructional investments that we've made, educator compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| school safety and security, and instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| And I believe that those important investments will help us meet the ambitious goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| that our school board has set through our strategic plan excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| Thank you, Chairman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| I'm glad to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Again, from Ms. Vanden's point, I can see about half of the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Are there any lights on, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Dr. McIntyre, you said that our teachers rank 37th in the state in compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5492)|
| 1:31:42| Does that just reflect classroom and principals, or does that include administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| That's classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Yeah, classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| That's classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Yeah, and that's last year's data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| I haven't got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| That's actually the best information on that actually comes from the Tennessee Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| That's where that ranking comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I haven't seen this year's yet, but last year it was 37th in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| What about the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Where does it rank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| You know, I don't have those figures handy, but like you all have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| we've been looking at doing a sort of a salary survey as well to see where we rank in other areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| So I believe that we'll have that information prepared for the budget development process in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Okay, one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| The ten schools, when you're talking about the technology, will it just be middle and high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| or is it going to be elementary, middle and high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| We'd like to do for the ten schools, we'd like to have a sort of a diverse representative population of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| So it would include elementary and middle and high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Are there any other questions for Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| Just wanted you to say a couple more things about the technology school competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| When schools were alerted to this, how long ago was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| They were alerted to the internal competition a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And it's, you know, they're very clear that it's pending funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| They're very clear that it's pending, you know, approval of the budget by the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| and appropriation by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| But I think the idea is for us to be prepared to say here's where we would move forward if those funds were appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5605)|
| 1:33:34| So if funding did take place and your schools, did you distinguish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| were you wanting to have so many elementary schools involved, so many middle, so many high in terms of the selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| or was it just based on the staff and how apparently best suited their foundation is for the technology that you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| Yeah, I think it's the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| I think it's we wanted to take a look at which, you know, what the applications look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| It's basically a narrative application and it's talking about how best to personalize learning for all of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| with the support of instructional technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| And so we're excited to hear about what the schools will develop in terms of their proposals and their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| I would expect that we would have both elementary, middle, and high schools in the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| And I would also expect, because I think it's important for us to have a geographic balance as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| to make sure that we have schools from across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| Because I think we want to be able to demonstrate that this type of instructional technology initiative can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| in all kinds of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| And so I would anticipate a real good representative sample of schools across the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| including elementary, middle, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Being an old teacher, of course, I've always got that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| and I always will have that perspective of being in a classroom and wondering what's going to come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| in terms of my expectations from administrative levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| And so in anticipation of that, what kinds of things, say my school is selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| and I am modestly prepared for a technology input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| then what kinds of accommodations does the administration take for all levels of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| and where they are in terms of technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| I think that when we think about the technology, the first thing people think of is the device, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| The actual hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| And I think that's actually, when we think about instructional technology, it's actually not about the technology at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| It's about what our teachers and our kids can do with the technology in terms of instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| and in terms of learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| So when we think about it, we have to think about it in terms of the infrastructure, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| The hardware is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| But I think perhaps the most important part of it is the professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| and training that goes for our teachers to be able to support this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| and then also support in terms of if a device breaks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| or the network goes down that we have folks to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| And so part of the sort of conceptual framework that we've been thinking about is using some really outstanding teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| who are great at technology and kind of bring together technology and content knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| and pedagogy in the work that they will do with their colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| And so there's an acronym TPAC, technology and content knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| and pedagogy that will really provide that level of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Now, so that type of professional development is going to be critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| But I'll also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Our competition sets a very clear expectation around this being not an initiative that just comes from the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| and they write a couple pages and say this is what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| but that's a collaborative effort on the part of the school community, including the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| And, in fact, there's a part of the application is a teacher signature page that says if we get this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5809)|
| 1:36:57| you know, if we get these resources, I'm going to integrate them into my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| I'm going to do my best to learn how to use these tools best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| I'm going to participate in the professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I'm going to be a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| So that's going to be part of how we choose which schools are going to be a part of this competition is by seeing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| level of teacher buy-in we get as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| And just along those lines, and I appreciate that type of approach, especially with consideration of the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| But I do want to remind you that the extraordinary pressures and stresses that they're under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| it's not the type of thing that you can say, hey, we're going to start this at 415 after a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5854)|
| 1:37:42| And so I hope that there are accommodations for those teachers, both in terms of pay or time or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| that it's not just another item that's going to be added to their plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| And I'm sure you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Part of the conceptualization is to do actually some pretty significant professional development over the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| when there's an opportunity to do that and to pay our teachers for that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| It's a lot to chew on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Very nice report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| I just have a couple of questions and just information, and it can be sent to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| It doesn't have to be if you don't have it off the top of your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| How many teachers are employed currently, I mean, that we have on payroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| We have in the neighborhood of about 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| We can get you certainly the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| It can be broken down to what, not necessarily each school, but like if they're in special ed or whatever in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5917)|
| 1:38:47| just for my own information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| And just back on your meeting that you're going to have on March 5th at Amherst, I didn't catch the time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| And I guess we'll be seeing you, if not before, but definitely next quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, Chairman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Is there any other business to come before this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| It looked like Commissioner Brown was going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| I'm just going to ask for a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I'll pass it back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| No, you know what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| I'll grant that ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Okay, commissioners, our next item is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| Could I hear a motion to approve our line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Those transfers are completed, will be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| Item number 37 is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| This is on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| This is an ordinance to amend Article 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| Appendix A of the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| to prohibit the conversion of billboards and other advertising signs to electronic advertising signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| or electronic message center signs in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| As amended, this is Ordinance 103 on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| I'll make a motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| We have a motion to move without recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| Dr. Briggs, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| You want to go ahead, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| The information that I passed out, and if Mr. Donaldson could come down when he gets an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| The information I passed out was prepared by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| Daniel Sanders prepared this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| We had a meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Just to be quite frank, I left the last commission meeting and didn't feel very comfortable with where our votes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6061)|
| 1:41:08| signs and billboards put us in regards to as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| And so I had discussion with Bud Armstrong and then Daniel joined our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| And so what I was hoping to do, the reason that we came, this is a framework that I'm going to ask to be added to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| agenda on Monday to where the commission asks MPC, us dropping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| withdrawing those two ordinances last month, kind of put them in a position that I think if Mark will let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| how he explained it to me as being uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| So if you'll, Mark, if you don't care to discuss that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| Yeah, at the conclusion of last month's meeting, you left instructions for the MPC to consider the approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6115)|
| 1:42:06| billboards as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| And after sleeping on that, I can only characterize that as throwing the planning commission under the bus as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6130)|
| 1:42:20| decisions regarding future billboards and their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| The criteria that we would have to come up with to make decisions regarding the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6147)|
| 1:42:38| and size of new billboards would be so much like regulation that it would be best done as regulation rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6158)|
| 1:42:47| discretionary role that the planning commission is placed in under the uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6167)|
| 1:42:57| They're given fairly wide latitude within the zoning ordinance and as such are then subject to much criticism from both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6177)|
| 1:43:10| sides quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| And I don't know that sign regulation is something that ought to be done as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| It would be much better to have clear cut and dried regulations which can be applicable across the board uniformly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6202)|
| 1:43:31| and clearly understood by any applicant when they get the desire to develop a sign so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| discretion is taken out of that decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6223)|
| 1:43:51| So I guess what I'd like to do is Monday Daniel will have this in a form where we can have a resolution form, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| to where we can ask MPC to use this framework to come back with a compromise that I think some of us wanted to put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6239)|
| 1:44:10| table or didn't know how to go about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| This will begin the process of eliminating some signs and start the discussion on ratios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| and whether or not we need different or more stringent regulations on as far as distance and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| So my hope is that when it comes back up Monday you'll consider this resolution to send back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| to make it to where they feel more comfortable with both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| You know, I guess, you know, we have an ordinance that we're going to be doing a second reading on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| And if that passes, how does this fit in with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Well, if it passes banning electronic billboards, we could readdress it in the new --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| It could be readdressed in the new thing, which my hope would be it would be addressed in the new ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| But I don't know what the recourse is if we let it sit or table it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| or I don't know what the preferred avenue the law department would like to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| But, again, I think if we want to decrease the amount of signs, we didn't take that measure last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| We just -- because right now it's open season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| They can get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| They can build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| And so we didn't eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| We didn't reduce our signs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| We got the public thinking we voted to eliminate billboards, and we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| We just eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Well, I mean, I think if they thought we were eliminating all billboards, I think that was a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| big misunderstanding because that would be a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Well, the desire was to eliminate through attrition is what the desire was, I think, of the ordinances that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6342)|
| 1:45:50| And so-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Well, maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I think the only ordinance that passed was the one banning the conversion of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| I'm talking about the other two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I mean, they're off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| But now we can increase our number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| So nobody has won in this discussion because scenic Knoxville wants to eliminate them through attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6363)|
| 1:46:12| Well, I mean, I don't know what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, they probably would like to take them all down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| But I'm talking about what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| And just to make it clear, what we voted on was digital billboards, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Now, I think Commissioner McKenzie sent it back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| What we wanted was just to withdraw the other two and not, you know, just withdraw them, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| They are withdrawn, but what we did-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| No, no, they weren't withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| They were sent to the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Then so we didn't put anybody in a good position to make-we didn't-NPC is uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6396)|
| 1:46:43| Well, I mean, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| But, I mean, I think that what we need to do on Monday, we need to vote do we want to have digital billboards or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| And if we vote against having digital billboards, then we can work with whatever, you know, whatever's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| Because I think that's really what people were complaining about the most are the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| And if you're talking about-and I'm not sure what's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| This is an 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| You know, we've had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| It's really been going on for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| And here we are, you know, a week before we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| And to put something else in here, is this about taking standard billboards and converting them to digitals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Well, this is about the whole process to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| What we did to NPC was we gave them no guidelines other than just to send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| And so this is a framework for working those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| I think that's absolutely fine as long as we go ahead and have our vote on the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| Because I think the overwhelming response from the people here is that we don't want digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| The problem across the country is where we've done these-you take down three and you put up one or this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| It's that there's lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| It's never clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| The ordinances are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| They're rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| And it gets to be just a legal morass as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| And people have been very unhappy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| It deals with property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| It deals with property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| If you're the guy that has a billboard on your property and you're going to take that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| you're taking away that man's livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| To do that, to the benefit of somebody who owns a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Right now, there's really only one company that can afford to put up digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| And that puts them at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| It puts the small property owner at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| It puts the small businessman at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| I mean, we're really forming a monopoly here, and it's not a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| And that's-I mean, part of it is looking at property owners and small businessmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| I think what we're doing is defending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| And that's why, you know, I'm opposed to any complex formula that gives an advantage to one out-of-state company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6515)|
| 1:48:45| To the disadvantage of Knox County property owners and to the disadvantage of small businessmen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6525)|
| 1:48:55| Okay, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| I agree with everything that's been said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| I guess the issue is what hasn't been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| You know, I don't want to be a soothsayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| If Monday's ordinance passes on second reading, I think we're going to have to tweak this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| I do think we kind of-well, I, the rest of us, so I'll put it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| I do think we put some things out there for MPC without a lot of guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| And I do appreciate Law Department and Commissioner Anders addressing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| trying to give a skeleton for us to, you know, hang things on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| But, you know, again, this is late coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| But as I read through here, we're introducing electronic advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| So if Monday we put that away, I would be fine giving MPC this framework for them to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6589)|
| 1:49:57| but it shouldn't include digital because, again, I don't want to-who knows what's going to happen Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6597)|
| 1:50:04| But if it does pass, and then we pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| You know, if we pass this resolution before then the ordinance passes, by the way it comes on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| we're going to get wrapped around the axle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| So I guess to the Law Department, if we could just-if we could sanitize this to just dealing with how we're going to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| with billboards, those other two things that we deferred, if it just deal with those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| and not the digital billboards and get a nomenclature so I don't-you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| we see electronic advertising sign, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Does that mean measure center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Does it mean digital billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| If we could kind of clean that up to where we know exactly what we're going to vote on in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| And I'm all for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| I do think, again, I propose and we pass that we, you know, send these things on to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| And I do think we need to give a lot more guidance than just do a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| So I thank you for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I just think we need to, you know, again, clean it up and make it applicable to the two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| that are going to be left out there when we're done, those other two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| I yield the floor to Law Department, Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| First, there's a third option for what's going to be before you on second reading next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6689)|
| 1:51:37| That would be to defer that matter and let that ordinance remain pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| until MPC returns a recommendation on the potential that you pass a resolution putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| another application before MPC based on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| And if you'll the second thing, if you look at the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| the intent there is to address regulation of billboards broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| and adopt a plan per MPC recommendation that would reduce the total number of billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6724)|
| 1:52:12| Now, the way that that does that, I'm not going to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| I gave out all my copies and I don't have a copy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| But I think it's the fourth thing down the list in the framework, the fourth thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| There's three subparts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| And it deals with permitting new billboards, permitting relocations of existing billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| and then permitting electronic advertising signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| And we've defined electronic advertising signs to be advertising signs that use electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| or mechanical method or means to change the copy on the display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| If MPC makes a broad recommendation, drafts a broad ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| and we'll help them do that, that addresses these three things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| the ordinance can be amended once it gets to you to strip out any one of those three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| or the way I explained it a minute ago to one of the commissioners is to turn the knob one way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6787)|
| 1:53:14| on ratios and locations and any of the sort of things in the body of that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6794)|
| 1:53:24| while allowing the whole ordinance to do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| which is permit new billboards or relocations or electronic billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6806)|
| 1:53:33| or any one of those things in the alternative in order to reduce the total number of billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| And, you know, I reiterate the concerns about taking property away from private business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6818)|
| 1:53:49| or small billboard operators, that's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6829)|
| 1:53:57| Our grandfather statute in Tennessee is one of the strongest grandfather statutes in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| Once you have a billboard on your property in Knox County or in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| you are guaranteed the right to continue that use indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| until somebody pays you compensation on the market to discontinue that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6852)|
| 1:54:21| So if you were to adopt an incentive program like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| a billboard company that wanted to have a new billboard, relocate a billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| or have a new electronic billboard would have to go on to the market and basically buy someone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| And if that person would not voluntarily enter into that transaction, it wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6881)|
| 1:54:50| So if you have a billboard out there in Knox County and you're a small guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| and that's your only income, nobody can force you to give that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| They have to come to you and purchase it under any sort of plan that would incentivize the reduction of the total number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6900)|
| 1:55:08| Daniel, in terms of what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| there were some questions that were brought up at the last public forum by Ms. Feld about Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6910)|
| 1:55:19| And I asked you about Asheville and their difficulty in regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| Did you have some news relative to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| I did pull Asheville's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| This is the second time I've pulled Asheville's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| And the first time was when I did the legal memorandum to the board about swap programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| Asheville's ordinance hasn't been updated since August of 2000 or August 28, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| Now, there have been news reports that they have adopted new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| And I have placed a call to the city of Asheville and their sign department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| but I haven't been able to make contact with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| And any ordinance that they may have passed since then, it's not available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| So until MuniCode updates it, I don't have access to it unless somebody from Asheville emails it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| But as it stands right now, the information available online permits electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| I know personally that there are electronic billboards in the city of Asheville because I've seen them with my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| And if they have acted to regulate electronic billboards, they've done it since August of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6979)|
| 1:56:30| And it's just not updated on MuniCode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| But the implication is that their attempts at regulating electronic billboards have been unsuccessful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=6994)|
| 1:56:43| or their legislative body is about to reconsider based on those difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| And at least that's what was alluded to by Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Do we know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| I'd like to say I've placed a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| I received a return call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| And I've left another voicemail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| The lady who is the administrator of their sign department, we just haven't been able to connect on the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7024)|
| 1:57:13| Mr. Donaldson, I've had discussions about the same SWOT programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| And apparently in some places they've been able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| They've been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| I think, Mark, you cited Minnesota or some places up north where apparently they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7044)|
| 1:57:32| And are you anticipating, if this is the route the body chooses to go and send it back for recommendations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7052)|
| 1:57:43| programs like that, is that the kind of model that you all would be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| Can you give us something about where we'd be, where we're headed from a regulatory side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7069)|
| 1:57:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| We have reviewed ordinances from around the country, the Minneapolis area, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7078)|
| 1:58:05| a number of communities have SWOT programs, Florida, many communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| And I know of at least one county that has a SWOT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| So we take a look at as much information as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| But keep in mind that, you know, we've kind of characterized this as cap and trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| Well, a crucial part of that is the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| And that cap is created by the prohibition on new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| So then once you establish that cap, then you create an incentive program to reduce that number by allowing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7114)|
| 1:58:44| to do certain things by exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| And one of those could be the relocation of an existing billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| And another could be the conversion of an existing billboard to electronic advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| I have to think of things very simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| So let me ask some very simple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| If we adopt Mr. Anders at our next meeting, this would go to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7150)|
| 1:59:18| and they would need to fill in the blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| For example, when it says that there shall be appropriate annual fees to offset the inspection of the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7160)|
| 1:59:26| they will define what those fees are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| When it says that they are being required to provide advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| or public service announcements free of charge to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| I don't really know what Knox County would advertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| but I'm assuming what we mean here is that they would do things for charities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| So, but that would be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| In other words, all of these things would be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Help me understand the process if we were to say yes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| To go back one step, if you recall the legal memorandum that we gave a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7196)|
| 2:00:04| there are a number of cities and different areas in there that have swap programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7204)|
| 2:00:13| Those ordinances contain similar items to the ones that are in the framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| And then with regard to the timeline on the front page, the front page there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| if you were to adopt the resolution next week, that would be the first thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| application for zoning amendment to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| And then MPC would spend some time with the help of the law director's office to draft a broad ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7233)|
| 2:00:41| And then specifically, if you were to go to the framework and you mentioned public service announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7241)|
| 2:00:48| well, a lot of these model ordinances have provision in there where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| a certain amount of time is set aside for, you know, amber alerts and things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7255)|
| 2:01:03| sorts of public service announcements that Knox County, you all, the county commission would deem appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| And then when MPC drafts that, it would come back before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| And an item like that, I would describe it as commission can turn the knob one way or another on an item like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7275)|
| 2:01:24| whether it be the exchange ratio or the limitations on illumination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7284)|
| 2:01:32| the number of slots that are set aside for public service announcements, the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| All those things, I mean, the fee, you could turn it down to zero if you wanted to once it came to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| Or you could turn it up slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| But as long as those things are addressed in the recommendation that MPC makes, they'll be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| They'll be in there for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| They'll be in there for public comment, consideration on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| And then you can amend it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| And then if it goes to second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| just want to make sure that those things are addressed so that you have an opportunity to know that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| And so MPC, you all will be responsible for giving us recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| And then it would come to us and we would take a look at it if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| So as far as the ordinance that's on the table now, we --- it's an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| I mean, if we say yes to the second reading, then where does this come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7342)|
| 2:02:30| I'm just trying to fully understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| Or if we say no to the second reading, we can take this up and this would be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7351)|
| 2:02:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Not next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Next week it would be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| And it would be a resolution to put an application before MPC to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| And then it would come back as an ordinance and we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| And as I suggested a minute ago, there's a third way on the ordinances before you on next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| which deals with the conversion and you might want to amend it to more explicitly ban electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| There's a third way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| It's to defer that until this, if you decide to adopt it, the MPC returns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| So it could sit on the agenda and be a pending ordinance until MPC returns its recommendation on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7394)|
| 2:03:24| Then we could incorporate some of these things into this ordinance that we're kind of putting on the table until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7404)|
| 2:03:33| This proposal is much broader than just, say, no digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7413)|
| 2:03:42| So I would view this proposal as replacing what's before you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7422)|
| 2:03:53| So I guess procedurally then the easiest thing for us to do if we like this, and I'm not saying I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| I'm saying if we like this would be to turn down the ordinance that's before us, pass a resolution on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| send it to MPC, as opposed to passing the ordinance and having them come in and bringing this to incorporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7447)|
| 2:04:15| You see why I'm confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| That's why I'm kind of looking for give me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| I'm trying to suggest that there is a third way where you don't have to reject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| or accept finally adopt what's before you on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| You could just defer it until MPC returns a recommendation on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| So this pending ordinance that's before you right now dealing with conversions of electronic billboards could sort of ride on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7478)|
| 2:04:49| Give MPC a time to return their recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| So you could consider them both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| If you reject this proposal, then you could go back to the other one and consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| And it would be on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| It will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| You know, as I read into this, I think what Sanders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| You can control the knob, but what I'm reading here is, yeah, we can turn the knob down to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| but we can also turn it up to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| Reading this, I mean, it says that commission, we can accept, amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| or reject without returning back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| So as I read this, this basically says we don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| We keep business status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| And if it comes before us, we'll vote as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| And I, too, have heard a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| We've all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| The whole notion of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| I think, again, who knows what's going to happen Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| But, you know, that piece, I'm not seeing evidence that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7555)|
| 2:06:03| we're wanting to move in a direction to add digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| This framework basically destroys that ordinance and says, MPC, y'all can do what you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7567)|
| 2:06:15| and bring it before us, but we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| And we can turn that knob that he speaks of up to 100, and they can all get approved, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| again, not talking about today, 2013, but maybe 2020, 2030, things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| I think this ordinance speaks to the desires of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| And so this, again, I'm fine with giving MPC something to hang some meat on and to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7596)|
| 2:06:45| But I don't know if this framework does what I heard last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| Again, the difference a month will make, and that will all go with our vote on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| But I think co-mingling this, I agree that this is a third option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| And this option is, let's do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| That's what this resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| Let's let MPC play, but we get to do what we could do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| But this doesn't change a thing with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| It basically gets rid of the moratorium and says, all right, now, let's play ball again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| It says that MPC would do some things, but we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| I'm going to look at the law director and ask him to explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| You got rid of the moratorium last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| The moratorium is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| No, I think what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| I think what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Dr. Briggs, I do think we talked a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| The moratorium is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| But because we have pending legislation, it's effectively in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| There can't be any additional applications until we're through with this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| So can I ask a point of order question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Do we have pending legislation on anything but digital billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| We have a 30-day window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| I mean, 60-day, the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| We're supposed to come back and deal with the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| So that hook kept additional permits from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| So, again, the third way is to do away with those three, which will, in all practical purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| stop the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Then this takes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| This resolution takes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| This is basically doing the same thing that we've always done with the step by NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| that we can reject at face value and it doesn't go back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| So I'm just saying this is what we're talking about with this framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| So, again, Monday will come and we'll discuss that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Yeah, go, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| I don't want to give any misunderstandings or make any misrepresentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| That sentence in there, accept, amend, or reject, that's, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7749)|
| 2:09:17| that gives commission a lot of flexibility when something comes back to you guys from NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7757)|
| 2:09:25| Now, because this regulates electronic message centers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| you could turn that knob all the way down to zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| and then you would have an ordinance that reduces the total number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| any time a billboard is relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| It's a traditional billboard or a new traditional billboard permits issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| And don't worry about electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| What we're trying to do here is to create sort of a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| because if you ban electronic message centers or electronic billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| then the people that are pro-electronic billboards don't get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7808)|
| 2:10:17| But the people who are anti-billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| and want to reduce the number of billboards in the county don't get what they want either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| So if you do the swap program, it's sort of dead center on what everybody wants, it seems like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7824)|
| 2:10:34| So that, you know, there are new billboards that are possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| or relocations that are possible or even electronic billboards that are possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| in exchange for what this contingency over here wants is we want to reduce the total number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| There's no real good way to do that but by this sort of exchange program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| Because attrition that's or amortization, that's just not available due to our grandfather clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| or grandfather statute in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| That would take a state amendment to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| Yeah, just to get back on this is that what's on the table right now has nothing to do with reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| the total number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| It's a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| Do we want to have digital billboards in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| And to me, it's a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| I mean, some of this is just bureaucratic befuddlement that forms, you know, a legal morass that we read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| and, you know, maybe there's this, maybe it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| It involves enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| It involves all these complicated things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| It's not done very well right now because these things aren't, you know, aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| I mean, we have regulations out there right now we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| We've had people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| We've had these, the people that own the billboard companies have been down here pleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| They said, do something so we know what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Don't put the moratorium off another six months because it will take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| They said, just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| And we've heard from three or four or 500, I don't know how many it is, people who said, these are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| I'll tell you, there's plenty of people who've said things to us that aren't writing letters to us that we, let's just decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| Do we want to have digital billboards in the county or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| I mean, it's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| It's a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| And then, when people come down here, it's as simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Read my lips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| No digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Not about reducing them or trading them or doing this or doing that or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| It's just as simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| We can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| If we decide we want digital billboards, let's have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| If we don't want digital billboards, let's just say it real clearly, no digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| And then we can deal with the rest of the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| You know, we threw this in MPC's lap, and we put you in a bad position, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| But I think it gets even more complicated when we start these, you know, these swap things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| They've had these in other parts of the country, and there's been problems with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| And, you know, I think we ought to money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| Let's go ahead and do what the billboard people have asked us to do, which is say vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| And, you know, if we decide that we want billboards, electronic digital billboards, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| Let's just decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| And then that settles it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| It's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| Mr. Dawson, did you have something else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| I had one more question just for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| I mean, as this exists right now, the ordinance that we passed on first reading, the use on review is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8009)|
| 2:13:36| I mean, I'm getting really befuddled myself about this whole argument as it extends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8016)|
| 2:13:43| Is there a use on review provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| There's nothing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| I mean, it's just gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| No digital billboards, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| Well, where is the --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| What's the problem with MPC as you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| Where are we causing you all trouble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| The direction from the commission last month upon postponing the ordinance to ban all new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8041)|
| 2:14:10| and the ordinance to create regulations for electronic message centers was for MPC to consider making those uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8050)|
| 2:14:20| permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| That's where the heartburn is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| We'll talk about it another time if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| Any other discussion on billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Let's have at least another hour or so on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8074)|
| 2:14:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| So we've got no recommendation to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Item number 39 on page 10, discussion of a joint meeting with Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| Knoxville City Council regarding the proposed safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| Go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| Safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| It's your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Well, last month's meeting you were to get with Nick and try to set up a meeting between the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8106)|
| 2:15:14| and the council so we could discuss this further and try to get it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| And I would just like to see where we are on it and if that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| A call was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| No meeting has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| It's kind of I don't know where the ball is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| It's probably someplace between here and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| But I did make the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| If we hang out long enough, we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8134)|
| 2:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| So would you try to push it over there a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Any other comments about safety center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I was going to ask, Mr. Chairman, do you have an agenda for your luncheon on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| I'm going to have to ask Joe Lee, what do we have on agenda for ethics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8167)|

| 2:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Because I was going to ask if we could have either Senator Massey or Mr. Dunn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| or Representative Haynes, since these are their resolutions before the legislature with regards to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| and the school superintendent, perhaps they could come to your luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| I know they're going to Nashville, but perhaps they could come by and I'd like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| I think we could make time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| That would be no problem with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Does anybody have any issues with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| I think that would be helpful for us to see their thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| and also see about these questions that we have since, you know, they are carrying the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| Could you make a contact on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| So we'll include them, Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Hey, come hungry on Monday, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| Chandler's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| But it is February, Black History Month, so we will have soul food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| It won't be Chandler's, but it will be every bit as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| Update of the ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| We're not through with discussion items, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| We're in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| Is this the ethics ad hoc committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| Yes, ethics ad hoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| This is you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| I didn't know which ad hoc we were about to hawk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| We met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| We've had a we've met again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| And I think that what we're going to come back and recommend, we're going to have one last meeting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| before the before this meeting next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| What we're looking at to try to satisfy some of the concerns that people had is we will try to make this an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| all-citizen committee rather than having direct representatives of the sheriff's office and me as the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8277)|
| 2:18:05| We would have nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| They could serve one four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| The citizen members would be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| We looked at different ways of doing this, and we can decide how we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| I really would like to check with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| We could have three of these could be appointed by the mayor, three by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| two by the ethics committee, and one by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| Now, these are all citizen appointments, or we could take one of those from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8309)|
| 2:18:35| If it mattered to the sheriff, take one of those from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| Then you'd have two from the sheriff, two from the mayor's office, three from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| and two appointed by the ethics committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| And they would be all citizen members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| We would have three ex officio non-voting members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| which would be a representative of the county commission, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| and the mayor's office who could explain to the citizen's group just how they would have the right to explain how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8336)|
| 2:19:05| government works or have input in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| They just couldn't vote if issues came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| We want to stagger this so we don't have everyone turning over on the ethics committee at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| And then the final thing we would like to do is to get back to the charge that we had from the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| that dealt with what ethics committees should be looking at in its conflicts of interest and gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8363)|
| 2:19:30| And most ethics committees, whether it's with TVA or whether it's with the U.S. House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| really do deal with those two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| It really had gotten, I think, out of hand of what we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| And if we get back to looking at those, and we potentially could have a lot of issues that come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| These aren't criminal issues, but it's just like what happened in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| If you have someone who's choosing the security system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| is it proper for him to be going to NASCAR races and hunting trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| and have two relatives that works for the company to choose that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| or should that person recuse himself from the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| We had something with one of the four mayors where we had a citizen that was doing business with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| and they paid for a trip to Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| Was that proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| And those are things that are even more recently with the ambulance contract where there was a question about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| there was a conflict of interest to someone on the panel when that was chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| That would be a particularly an instance of an ethics issue that the committee could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| We don't need to be looking at insider trading on land property because the ethics commission does not have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8435)|
| 2:20:43| They can't put people under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| They shouldn't be doing criminal investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| They shouldn't be retrying cases that's already been tried in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| That's the job of the attorney general, the TBI, the FBI, and the law enforcement agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| the sheriff's office and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| And just limit it to things that ethics committees normally look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| whether it's in businesses or whether it's in government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| And ultimately what we'll do is we'll come up with that and bring that back to the county commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| for final approval or to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Thank you, Dr. Briggs, for saying some of the things that I wanted to express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| I was in town early to attend the meeting, and I got tied up, and I got here about in time for the adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8492)|
| 2:21:40| You said a moment ago ethics committees, and that was plural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8500)|
| 2:21:47| In Knox County, the administration has ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8507)|
| 2:21:53| The school board has an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| The sheriff's department has it and does a lot of training on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| We commission have a subcommittee, the audit committee, which is at one point of contact to an anonymous phone line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8522)|
| 2:22:12| to report waste, fraud, and abuse issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8532)|
| 2:22:20| The singular focus of what we're talking about right at the moment, the ethics committee, as given by mandate of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8540)|
| 2:22:31| we will, in order for me to support something coming before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| we'll have to return to whatever that mandate of the state is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| If we're looking at something that's illegal, that's not their function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| As I remember, and whenever we went through this three or four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| it was about elected officials receiving gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| And we've let it go this way and that way and another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| All of these other different directions are covered by someone else's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| So, Mr. Law Director, whenever this finally does come to us from the ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8586)|
| 2:23:14| addressing the language of whatever the Tennessee Code paragraph is that we're addressing with our single focus ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8594)|
| 2:23:28| that's what I'll be supporting if that's the way the resolution comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8608)|
| 2:23:37| I'm really glad to see the makeup of the committee being just regular citizens, especially trained citizens, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8617)|
| 2:23:46| And the focus of the committee, though, will have to remain with what the state has mandated that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8626)|
| 2:23:54| I think there's two issues that the state told us is conflicts of interest and gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| Of elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| No, it doesn't have to be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| The fellow, I mean, in my opinion, the fellow that took me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| No, well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| No, because if you have someone down here that's, you know, like the guy that was in charge of security with the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8646)|
| 2:24:14| I mean, he wasn't elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| But that's under the authority of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| That's under the authority of the Board of Education, not Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| You know, I'd have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| I'm not sure it was gifts to elected officials, but we'd have to look and see what the charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| And the other thing is I was getting a comment here besides, and I'll just use the name, Hugh Holt does purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8668)|
| 2:24:37| That's a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| If he does something wrong, that's a responsibility of the administration to ferry it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| And it's broken the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| Well, it doesn't necessarily mean they've done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| There's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| The only thing that should come to the Ethics Committee is where there's a question like if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| let's say we're going over to lobby over in Nashville and somebody's taking a van over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| Can we ride with them over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Can we car share with them or is that not permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| I'm going to roll over right now and say the law director should bring to us what the Tennessee Code has directed us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| and that's what I'll support and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| And I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| And I thought that's where we were on that same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| Might I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Commissioner, what Dr. Briggs has said is exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| He's trying to narrow it down to what the state statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| States and our Code of Ethics, which we adopted, which was the one that CTAS provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8736)|
| 2:25:44| exempts the Knox County Board of Education, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| However, they are under the same mandate from the state that we don't have under this ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8749)|
| 2:25:56| And Dr. Briggs has made a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| And the law director's office is going to fashion some wording to put in there to amend our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8759)|
| 2:26:06| But he's right on track to narrow it down to specifically what's under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| And that's what we intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| And that's exactly what I support along with Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| And thank you for representing us on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| One more item and we're out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| Discussion of tax relief for South Knoxville merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Dr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| Come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Dr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| As you all have seen in the media a week or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| the mayor has petitioned Nashville for some tax relief for the merchants affected by the extended closure of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8803)|
| 2:26:54| Personally, I've talked to merchants who borrowed money based on the fact that they were going to be able to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8814)|
| 2:27:01| on June 30th of this year and they got enough, hopefully, to get them over the hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| Now they're going to have to go back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| It's devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| And we're not just talking in that one little short few blocks out to Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| I'm talking about going all the way out to some of the bigger places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8837)|
| 2:27:22| It's been done before in Nashville when they had the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| They had something in Chattanooga that they did the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| And I talked to our law director and prematurely asked him to draw a resolution for us to send to the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8849)|
| 2:27:42| supporting the mayor's mirroring his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| And he is also checking with CTAS to see if there's any way that this is governed by the state law, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8866)|
| 2:27:56| any way that we could give them some local property tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| So I would like to have this on the agenda for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| And I think Bud probably already has it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| Are we all working on it, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| So, in a sense, mirror what the mayor had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| Plus we're talking also about the advisability and the availability of being able to do something with our local taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8897)|
| 2:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| And this will be as an ad on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| Any other comments about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| Shop south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| Are you saying that both items are going to be the state relief and the local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8921)|
| 2:28:48| Because I'd be willing to bet we probably need to have a conversation with the school board about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8928)|
| 2:28:54| No, I'm talking about school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| The school board is not in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| No, I guess what I'm saying is are you on Monday, on Monday's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| are you talking about local property tax relief or are we just talking about supporting the mayor and his efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8942)|
| 2:29:09| Well, this resolution would just be to support the resolution that he sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8949)|
| 2:29:16| but we're also checking with the state to see if it's possible that we can do something with local tax relief also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8956)|
| 2:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| But that's not a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| It's a separate thing from the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| Anybody have any other business for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Seeing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130219?start=8980)|
