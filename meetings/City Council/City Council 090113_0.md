| 0:02:14| by the end of February will be finished, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| So things are moving on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=137)|

| 0:04:53| in changing the landscape that we know today in our county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| We only think that it's befitting that all the ordeals and things that these men and women went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| that we pay some honor to them because they truly have left a footprint that will be left here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=308)|

| 0:05:32| to Lost Sheep Ministries, who we think do some tremendous work here in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=332)|

| 0:07:12| Council, how about we postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| To get some questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| And I've slept a few times since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| I'm trying to remember exactly what questions we wanted answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| But since we postponed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I think it would be good to cover that ground rather than just moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Mr. Anderson, do you want to comment real quickly on the summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| I sent a letter to all the city council explaining why the additional costs for maintenance of the Lower Second Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=454)|
| 0:07:44| It should be in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| It's a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| If it wasn't in your packet, it should have been sent directly to you, emailed directly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| It's a list of what they're going to do on the Lower Second Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| It just simply explains that we have to provide security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| We have to clean the parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| We have to prune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| We have to cut the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| And we waited a year so that we could figure out the exact costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| And what we're doing, the budget reflects what they spent last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| and we're monitoring it on a biweekly basis with PBA, and they've agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| The public service department has people from horticulture overseeing to make sure that they're holding it to the same standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| and same quality as the rest of the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| And that's why it seems a little bit expensive, but all we have to go on is what they spent last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=516)|

| 0:08:39| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=520)|

| 0:08:52| commonly referred to as the former site of the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=532)|

| 0:08:58| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| I'm just curious about the lawsuit that was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| I don't remember hearing a whole lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I'll let Debbie take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| I'd be happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| The lawsuit was actually resolved in the city's favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| The order became final at the end of December, and so there will be no further appeal of that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| And essentially the court blessed all the terms of the development agreement that you see before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| as not being in violation of the ordinance that was being challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| What position did the city take in this lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| I mean, there were 12,000-plus people that voted that they didn't want to spend any money on a convention center hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| or any of the accessories that went along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| So I'm just curious as to what position did the city take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| That this development agreement does not include any expenditure of city funds for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| It is a tax abatement and empowerment zone bonds, which are not backed by the city's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=600)|
| 0:10:13| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I had a brief conversation this afternoon with Dr. Lyons, which I'm always appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| One thing that I think was, I don't think anybody at the city said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| but it nevertheless appeared in Hayes' article in the paper this morning, the gist of that this is legally in the clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| And as I told Dr. Lyons, of all people, to have money to throw lawyers at something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| it would be the same person who filed the original lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| I have no doubt about, you know, the developer or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| I'm still having to work through the situation, you know, whether or not the lay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| I think that more than likely the language in the ordinance, which Mr. Haney had passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| probably does not address this present situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| But I'm still having to, you know, work through some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| I know this is, there are going to be other subsequent votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| This might not, you know, move this forward tonight, but I still want to feel comfortable about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| You know, alluding a little bit to what Councilman Hall just said, you know, there was a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| But, you know, I still express, you know, little concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| I would just add to that the issue of the tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| That language was specifically included in that ordinance, and it allows tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| And that's what this development agreement calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| I realize that that ballot measure was also written to allow tax funds or funds to be spent on presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| than existing hotels, you know, trying to thwart one and help yourself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| So, you know, there's a little bit of irony here where they might fall on their own sword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=726)|
| 0:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Councilman Frost, you alluded to further votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| What are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| The easy bond designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Each of those votes are on severally right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| And the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| I think it's a good project overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| I talked with Mr. Kazana, and I appreciate them in a difficult financial climate trying to move a substantial project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=759)|
| 0:12:49| like this forward, which is going to be a tremendous challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| In fact, it's probably going to take a while before the market recovers to really be able to move a project like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| forward and get it under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| But I would hope that we, as it gets into final design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and I know very little design has been done so far, that we look at our downtown design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| and do everything we can to make it a good urban design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| and not sort of just a freestanding project that isolates itself from the rest of the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| And I know that that's where you're trying to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| So, again, I think there's an opportunity as we work through this to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| And I think the timing will allow that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Of course, you may, Mr. Kazana, I don't know if you have any comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| You're at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I will be here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| But I appreciate your all support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Nick, if you could just, since you did speak, give us your name and address, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Nicholas Kazana, 5108 Buckhead Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=836)|

| 0:14:04| I heard eight ayes and Mr. Hall, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=846)|

| 0:15:39| I'm going to make a motion to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| I'll explain my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Go ahead, Councilman Hucklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I'm going to talk to Mr. King this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Mr. King, you may or may not have any new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Do you have any new information since we last talked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| I was able to talk to John Hunter with TDOT just shortly before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| and he did tell me that the project is scheduled for bids late fall or early winter of 2009 or early 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=966)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| So it's not part of the shovel ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| It's not attempting to go for the federal economic stimulus infrastructure monies that are proposed now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=984)|
| 0:16:33| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Because that was one of the questions that we discussed when I talked to Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| Council, two meetings ago on December 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| this council passed a Resolution 11E requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and encouraging appropriate officials of the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| to conduct a context-sensitive solutions mitigation planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| for the Henley Street Bridge reconstruction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| And that was passed unanimously by this council, as you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| and sent on to the commissioner, Commissioner Nicely, and I believe to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| And as of yet, as far as I know, there has been no communication back from TDOT on that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| And so I think it might be appropriate before, especially since we're not under the gun on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| this contract with TDOT on the Henley Street Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| it might be appropriate before we approve the contract to see if we can get some communication back from them on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1053)|
| 0:17:42| So I would encourage council to vote to postpone this, not for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| but for two weeks so we can see where we're at with TDOT on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Councilman Holquist, I think I can support a two-week postponement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| but I would hate to see us delay to the point where if there is an entity looking for a shovel-ready project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| and this delay on our part makes us not ready and, you know, we miss an opportunity, I think that would be unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| Well, I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| I think that by all the lists and according to Mr. Hunter, this has not been submitted for one of the shovel-ready projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| And I would guess that at this late date, if it's not been submitted or put on any of the lists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| that it's very unlikely that it would get on one of those lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| If that were to change, of course, we can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| What specific outcomes are you looking for from TDOT in terms of that contextual study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| Well, the context-sensitive solutions part would address impacts in the adjacent areas north and south of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1118)|
| 0:18:47| And also there are some concerns about whether or not TDOT has adequately addressed bridge design components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| such as the pedestrian portions of the bridge adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Certainly there's been some expression of the desire on the part of people in the city government community to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| But there's been no clear evidence as far as I know, and I'm not privy to all the design information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| but based on the information I have, there's no evidence that TDOT has really responded in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| And also the impacts to the south of the bridge and to the north of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| because there are concerns about if they widen and add additional traffic lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| are they going to have to widen the highways north and south of the bridge, which could be very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| On the south side, because of south waterfront development, future hospital construction, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| On the north side, because Henley Street is constrained and it would be very difficult to widen Henley Street on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| So that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| The other part is the mitigation during construction itself, which is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| How is TDOT going to address the need to mitigate traffic impacts by closure of such an important facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| And we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| We've heard nothing from them yet as far as I know in terms of how they intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| So that's the reason the resolution was introduced in mid-December, and the council passed that resolution unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. King, once this construction agreement is approved with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| how much local input or local control do we have in terms of the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And you and I spoke this afternoon about bicycle lanes and pedestrian lanes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| Well, we have opportunity for input into the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Obviously, it's TDOT structure to own and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| I can't guarantee you what kind of hearing we'll get on those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| One of my biggest concerns, Councilman Hokus has already mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| is the being able to deter traffic and to utilize the South Knoxville Boulevard Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| the James White Parkway at the intersection of Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And I've already talked with Mr. Hunter and Mr. Corum about some temporary improvements that we think would facilitate those movements during the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1270)|
| 0:21:20| Okay. Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Let's see. Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Mayor Haslund, on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Ms. Roddy has already addressed the fact that I'm real concerned about postponements that we may lose our place in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1286)|
| 0:21:37| And with funds as tight as they are going to be, I don't think we want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| And I just want to comment on a little experience that I have had over the seven years I've sat on this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| and it began immediately with the construction of the interstate out west and the closure of a bridge and rebuilding of that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1311)|
| 0:22:00| which led into a neighborhood and there was a lot of concern and interest, I should say, about how that would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| And could not have asked for more cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| You know, the way you approach something like that, not with the assumption that there are going to be all kinds of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1332)|
| 0:22:21| and there aren't going to be avenues for communication, but with the understanding that TDOT is very anxious to work with neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1341)|
| 0:22:30| to work with areas in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Honestly, we were driving down the interstate through the construction this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| and my husband and I both commented to each other almost in a little duet about how amazing TDOT has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1358)|
| 0:22:47| about how their preliminary work, as Mr. King mentioned, has addressed so many of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| And we just haven't had the concerns that Knoxville was very concerned about before the construction all began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| We have had an absolutely perfect relationship, I believe, with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Mr. Quorum and Mr. Hunter both have just been available at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I am confident they will be with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And I'm confident that we need to be ready when they are ready to make their bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| because a couple of bridge projects out my way have had to be delayed because there's too much other construction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| Now they've had to be rebid, and the escalating cost is a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| So I just would have to say, as Ms. Riley did, I'm fine with a two-week postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| but I think that means that we're going to come back and be ready to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| Otherwise, I will not vote for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| So I think whatever needs to happen to make you feel more comfortable needs to happen within two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| or I can't support a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| I share in the comments of Councilmember Pelo and Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| I have, with regards to putting this off, and we may actually be not benefiting ourselves here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I don't know if Mr. King can answer this or maybe Councilmember Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| And I feel comfortable addressing this issue because part of this is in my district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| If we do not hear from TDOT in two weeks, you know, what is our recourse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| And is this resolution somehow going to force or require TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| We're just requesting that they respond to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| If they choose not to, what posture does that leave us in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| And then number two, with regards to the issue of context sensitivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| and some of the very valid points that Councilmember Holquist brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| who is to be the contact person with TDOT regarding these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| If they decide to talk to us between now and the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| is that going to be the administration and Steve King or someone at the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| or is that going to be Councilmember Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| I don't remember if the resolution we passed addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| But can I get an answer to both of those two questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Well, Mr. King may want to weigh in on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| First of all, I'd say that you have to remember that TDOT is a very large organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| And while I agree that Mr. Hunter and Mr. Quorum, who I both know very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| are wonderful individuals and they're great to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| this project is apparently an in-house design project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| While there is design staff at the regional office that Mr. Quorum oversees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| the design will not be done in the regional office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| It will be done in Nashville because it's a structural project, a bridge project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and they have a different group that addresses those designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and does those designs when they're done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| As far as the context-sensitive solutions process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| that's something that has developed in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| TDOT has embraced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| The Federal Highway Administration has really sort of laid out the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| and created the structure for that process, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| And so it's a nationally recognized approach to making sure that these major highway construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| and infrastructure projects integrate with the other needs in the community as is reasonably possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| It's a well-known process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| It doesn't mean they do it on every process, but if there's a request from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| they're much more likely to respond to that and to agree to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| And I would hope that between now and the meeting two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| we can have some communication with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| and get a better idea of what their position is on doing a CSS process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| and or addressing the mitigation issues that are at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| The second part of my question was, who is TDOT to contact with regards to these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| Is that something that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I would guess that would be Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Well, I will be coordinating with TDOT as I do on other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| But on this particular request from council, Mr. Hunter told me they did receive it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| and the request came from the recorder's office, and he said they will respond back to the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| So you will get some written correspondence on your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| See, that's where I'm kind of going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| So we get written correspondence back to the recorder's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| and I guess that's mailed out to council members and sent to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Where do we go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| I still see that in two weeks from now, if we don't get a response, I guess we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| But if we do get a response, it may necessitate a continuous postponement of this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| as we try to figure out who's going to be addressing these issues or speaking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So we can't resolve that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| but I anticipate that if we do get a response from TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| we're going to be talking about another possible extension or continuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| which I'm getting a little uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Tonight, I think for two weeks, it may be reasonable since you tell me they've told you that they've received it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| and that they plan on responding, but I don't know if the response is going to answer all of Councilman Holquist's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| which some are valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and I think maybe we could address in another manner or another way as this process goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| and I think we still have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| So it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| but for this one more postponement, I will support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| but I will be very hesitant to do it again if we're in this same posture two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| I think Councilman Woodhull had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I'll go after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Well, I just want to say that I'm hearing that TDOT already includes context-sensitive elements in their process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| so even if we don't hear from them, they will include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| I'm not certain that that's true on a big design project in a formal sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| So if we don't hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| that doesn't mean that they're not going to engage in these elements in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| I wouldn't assume that they will or won't if we don't hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| Do you expect to hear within two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| I would be hopeful that we'll have some communication with TDOT in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Ms. Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Well, you know, I just am confident that this is the manner in which they approach their projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1793)|
| 0:30:05| And I think it was far prior to any federal regulations or guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| We had a number of public meetings which TDOT set up with the contractors, with the design people from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1813)|
| 0:30:25| with every aspect of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| And they were as anxious to get input from the area residents and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1828)|
| 0:30:37| as the area residents and businesses were to communicate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| And it could not have been a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Now, that was very early on in this administration in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| And I cannot imagine that they would approach a project like replacing that bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| and the approaches without a tremendous amount of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| And for that reason, I don't know that they will quickly be ready to have a meeting and respond to our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| I just think that they will recognize council's interest in being a part of that informative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| So, you know, enough said, but I really think we're just straining over a gnat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Well, I guess it depends on your perspective as to whether we're straining over a gnat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| This is the most important access to the southern part of the city, this one bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| Most of the volume of traffic crosses this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| It has a tremendous impact on the community I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| And I hardly think that it's a gnat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| I think it's extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| The closure of this bridge, you know, the project is estimated right now to last between 18 and 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| Closing a bridge for two years will have a huge impact on the businesses, the residents, commuters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| everyone that uses that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Businesses are in danger of going out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So I'm trying to stand up for the constituents that I represent and the community I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| because they face impacts that are going to be very, very difficult to mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| And someone can minimize that if they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| But I will not do that for my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| It wasn't that I was minimizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| It was that I was trying to reassure you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=1957)|

| 0:34:33| I'm seeing heads nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| We have a lot that are kind of some for, some against, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I'm going to ask maybe Mr. Greave and Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| They signed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| They noted that they're some for, some against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And because of the nature of this and all the different things on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| if you'll allow me to do that, we'll work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| and we'll try to make certain everybody gets a chance to make their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| How many people did sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| We have one, two, three, four, five signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Mr. Greave, why don't you come first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Duane Greave, number 8 Emory Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| I'm here as President representing Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Rather than repeat the background information that we've already presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| in regard to EMCs and the history of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| I'd like to begin by emphasizing to Council our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| which is to preserve and enhance the scenic resources of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| We are most proud of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| We want people to come here to live and to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and we're working toward the goal of helping Knoxville avoid what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| in so many communities across the U.S., and that's visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Before I state our position on the proposed revision to the ordinances on EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| I want to have the record show how much we appreciate the cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and the work that Gary Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and his staff have done in regard to not only answering our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| but following up on seeing that existing EMCs meet the existing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| He and his staff have called on us, kept us informed of their work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| and given us information on a sign-by-sign basis as to whether the signs fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| under the present ordinance or were grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| I hope that each of you have noticed how signs are no longer flashing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| scrolling, and screaming at us as we go down our roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| So again, thank you, Anita and Gary, for all the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Now, Scenic Knoxville's position on the proposed EMC ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| We appreciate also MPC staff's work and feel we are headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| There are, however, several areas we'd like to see clarified and further researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| First and foremost, our stand is no new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| Take the lead as the Council of 2001 did in regard to billboard sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| and ban any new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| No more visual pollution and proliferation of signs in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| Second, as to the existing EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| enact the proposed regulations with the exceptions to the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Do not exempt city-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Why have regulations that you enforce but do not follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| As to messages and amber alerts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| all this can be done within the proposed ordinances on the city-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| The brightness standards, how will they be enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Does it make sense to have the owner self-enforce their own signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Will this self-monitoring really work, and how will it be controlled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Those are questions that we have in regard to brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And then the next issue that we're greatly concerned about is Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Do not allow Turkey Creek to have a sign of 420 square feet for an EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| being proposed adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Is this not a billboard wrapped in EMC wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Go to Chattanooga and see the sign at Hamilton Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| It's along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Do not need this size of a sign as an introduction to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| or as a potential safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Questions that arise about this particular sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| how will the messages be displayed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| How many messages will be shown on a 20-by-20-foot sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Is it one message, two, ten, thirty, or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| How will they have those messages shown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| Will this sign follow the proposed regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| If this is allowed as part of a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| the proposed amendment by MPC staff says it allows no more than 33 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| up to a maximum of 100 square feet as an EMC that is integrated into the development sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| And that's what should be considered, no more than 100 square feet if one is to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| If you allow an EMC of this size, the size that they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| will this have any effect on the definition of digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| and open up potential legal situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Let's ban any new EMCs and put into action regulations on the existing EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| I do want to say that I do think that digital billboards and EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| are only a part of the overriding issue that we need to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| which is all signage in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Wayfinding is important, and we need to look at all the areas of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and begin to look at what has happened with the proliferation and the clutter of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| We have areas of our city that are difficult to find businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| due to the massive amount of signs along the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Also, amortization needs to be studied as a way to alleviate excessive signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| Banning EMCs is a beginning and the right step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Let's continue to work together in the spirit of cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| and remove any potential visual clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| remove the potential proliferation of any more digital signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| and continue to work towards a green community by enhancing our natural, scenic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| I'll be happy to answer any questions now or later as to scenic Knoxville's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Again, Council and Mayor, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2467)|
| 0:41:15| Mayor Haslam, members of Council, I wanted to address one item that's being presented to you by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| I'm sorry, if you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Gene Burr, 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| I wanted to address one item that's being presented to you as an option by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| and it's one that is often clouded by misunderstandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| because there are some major obstacles in the use of amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| Amortization of nonconforming EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| which if the presentation that's before you is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2515)|
| 0:42:04| amortization of nonconforming EMCs, which is included in option D of MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| is described as prorating a debt over time, as in making installment payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| It's a very useful procedure for local governments to exercise in the public interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| to remove nonconforming signs or structures without making cash compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| while allowing property owners reasonable benefit from their investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| There are constraints, as you are most likely aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and these are often the source of misunderstandings, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| In 1965, the advertising industry persuaded Congress to deny the use of amortization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| and removal of nonconforming billboards along federal-aid highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| It is ironical that this prohibition is part of the Highway Beautification Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| Subsequently, the Tennessee legislature incorporated into TCA 137208| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| a provision that signs being treated as businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| on properties that are rezoned where regulations under new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| would otherwise necessitate removal due to noncompliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| cannot be removed through amortization, but owners must be compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| The fact remains that the intent of adoption of new standards of land-use regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| is to bring properties into compliance with new regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and eventually eliminate nonconforming uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| With amortization, an owner of a nonconforming use is allowed to recoup his or her investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| while the noncompliance is eliminated without payment of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| The amortization period is determined through use of IRS depreciation schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| and other considerations to meet the test of reasonableness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| It is a practical tool for local government to use to achieve community objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| in a manner that is effective and economical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I wanted to offer that for your consideration as you consider the bigger picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| of how we deal with visual pollution and how we eventually eliminate those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| that no longer meet the community standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| I'll certainly be delighted to answer any questions, Mr. Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Mr. Jim DeRopp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| Mayor Haslam, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| The issue...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Sorry, Mr. DeRopp, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Jim DeRopp, 4126 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| The issue is electronic message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| I know Council has been concerned and there's been a lot of conversation about digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| but here we're speaking of a different cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| This cat is the one that exists on business premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| It's not an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| It's an on-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Those of you who, in the West Knoxville area, have seen an example of this at the shrimp dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Others of you have seen the example at CVS and Walgreens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| and we can speak of other examples throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But I would ask Council to give serious consideration to the ban of electronic message centers or message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2764)|
| 0:46:18| They present a new technology in advertising, a technology of brightness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| a technology that says, look at me and look at nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| The unfortunate thing about this technology, it is dominating to the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| You will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| You cannot drive up Kingston Pike and past the shrimp dock and not see their sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| It's scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Unfortunately, it's grandfathered in, so it has to scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| I don't personally see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| I like those boys down there, but I don't go down there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| The problem is that you get one started, the other one has to have one too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| because it's new and it dominates and it's effective to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| And the point is when everybody has one, no one ever sees one anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| It's a shameful thing, but it's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And when we want to say, well, where do we stand on community standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| What do we do about all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| We say, well, why don't we just eliminate electronic message boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| and then we won't have to deal with the ratcheting up of technology in advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| And that's what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| There's no end to it, really, unless you draw a line and say, okay, you know, we got CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| Walgreens does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| CVS started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Walgreens comes behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| The next thing you know, this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| The next thing you know, you think you had a signboard jungle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Now you really have a signboard jungle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So where do we draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I hope the council will consider a ban on these electronic message boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| before they truly get out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| I mean, they talk about the brightness issue and how do we monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| And you know how you manage a monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| They're in nits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Nits is the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Nits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Nits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Well, here a nit, there a nit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Next thing you know, you've got a nitwit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| So I say let's just ban these things and get done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| And I think the city will be better off for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| I know it will be much more pleasant to drive our streets without the competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| Mr. Mayor, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| Robert Bedwell and I are here on behalf of approval of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2941)|
| 0:49:10| as recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| I'm going to hand out something we gave to you back several months ago when the issue first came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2954)|
| 0:49:28| I am speaking on behalf of Turkey Creek here, the amendment that has been referred to already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| But this amendment is not limited to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| Turkey Creek, over a decade before scenic Knoxville was founded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| was a leader in reducing and controlling signage in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| When the Turkey Creek development started in 1995, we removed billboards along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| surrendered permits, we limited signage at Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| and worked with the Metropolitan Planning Commission and the city of Knoxville to develop a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3006)|
| 0:50:15| whereby we would have basically limited signage, uniform signage, for a major corporate commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| To that end, we developed the ordinance with the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| The ordinance allowing a master signage plan is not limited to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| I don't know whether any other developments have adopted it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| but I am working on two that will be submitting master signage plans to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| One, a small commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Another one, a rather large mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| But it is a tool to reduce signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Turkey Creek is allowed three off-premise signs under the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| The one I have shown you is basically what exists on Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| This is our only sign for over a mile of interstate frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| We have monument signs at the east end on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| We would be allowed one more at the west end or the Campbell Station Road entrance into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3079)|
| 0:51:28| Part of that is in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| That has not been utilized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| What we are asking, what we ask MPC and what MPC approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| was to allow up to a 420-square-foot EMC on one sign in a 100-acre-plus commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3099)|
| 0:51:53| that is subject to a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Right now that applies to Turkey Creek, but let's look at some other scenarios in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| Let's say the Bearden Village could get together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| we, as merchants, agree we're going to remove part of our signage in return for a master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3127)|
| 0:52:17| that reduces our signage, makes it more conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| We could have a sign like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| Same with Fountain City, Broadway, the Broadway merchants in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| It could also apply to Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Those are the three areas that immediately come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| This would be an incentive to reduce sign clutter in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| That's why we think this is important, why we think this is a very good amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| This would be the only EMC on the Turkey Creek premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| They are prohibited by the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| They are not permitted by the master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| but we feel that we should have this to give us the latest in sign technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| on our one sign that fronts on Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| And that's the only sign we have for over a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Had Turkey Creek allowed its tenants to take advantage of the sign ordinances that existed in the late 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3200)|
| 0:53:32| had it not entered into and developed a master sign plan, it would not look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| The developers said, we want this development to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| We want it to continue to look good as it continues to build out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| and we think this is a necessary part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| By the way, we applied for this sign before this discussion came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| We were working on this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| We submitted a plan to Mr. Brenneman and the city sign inspector, and we're working through issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3240)|
| 0:54:10| Suddenly, the moratorium came up, and we stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| And this has been going on for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Turkey Creek seeks to continue to lead the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| in actually doing something about reduction of signage and doing good signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| and we think this is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| I think there's a question, Mr. Seymour, from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| This is very clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Did you call this an off-premise sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Under a master signage plan it is because we have Wal-Mart, Target, and who else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| That is permitted only under a master signage plan where you have tracks that have been sold off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| but it is a unified commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| But it's not an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| It's not an off-premise sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| It's permitted under the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| It is a master sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| A master development directory sign for the Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| I guess Mr. Bidwell is going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Mr. Donaldson, I think I'm going to ask you that question later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| You can go ahead and ask it now if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| I'm not going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| It's up to you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| The type of sign that Mr. Seymour is referring to is called a development directory sign within the sign code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| and that's a particular type of sign that's allowed only within a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| And is it an off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It functions somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| It's within the geography of the master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| but it can advertise businesses that are located on separate lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| As long as they're in the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Mr. Bidwell, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Robert Bidwell, 1321 Harvey Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| And further on that, we developed the master signage plan with MPC just to work out issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3367)|
| 0:56:22| In answer to Mr. Greaves' questions, only one message would be allowed at a time on the sign, just like any other EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3382)|
| 0:56:36| On the interstate, the letters have to be larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| That's part of the restrictions anyway, but in order for them to even be readable, they have to be large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3399)|
| 0:56:49| We are agreeing to follow all of the proposed requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| Those are not issues that we're up here to fight over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| And there's been one point brought to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| We really, instead of asking for 420 feet, we should have asked for 400 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and we would gladly accept an amendment to that to bring it back inside the existing maximum dimensions under the current C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3434)|
| 0:57:29| But we feel that this is not a Turkey Creek issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| Turkey Creek is the first user to request this incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| We think it helps the small tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| We think those are the ones that financially are in the most trouble right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| We're not going to give them pile-on signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| We didn't give them pile-on signs to start with, but we do want to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| We think this is a viable alternative for them to get their message out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| We also think that other groups of property owners could use the same incentive to clean up existing signage along the major thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3484)|
| 0:58:16| and we think there needs to be an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Otherwise, we do not believe anybody will clean up signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| No, you go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Mr. Bedwell, I have a question, or at least one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Does Turkey Creek, as a development, I know they have restrictions and covenants, et cetera, within the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| Do they allow EMCs anywhere within the Turkey Creek development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| They're specifically prohibited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| They are not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I cannot tell you legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Not allowed, prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I can't tell you legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| I think that's roughly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Our signage committee has not allowed, signage review board has not allowed any EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Do you have any idea why that might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| Because we did not want a proliferation of small EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| What was the rationale for not allowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| The same reason we didn't allow every individual tenant to have a pylon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| We are trying to be good stewards, and we're trying to have a project that has a limited amount of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| And internally lit signs, like letters that say Walgreens or whatever the business may be, on the business walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| those are allowed within certain parameters, whether it's city code or per the covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| and restrictions placed on by the Turkey Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Those are allowed, but EMCs are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| So that implies that EMCs are a type of sign that would be considered excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3604)|
| 1:00:13| or objectionable within that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| 100 square foot signs, yes, would be objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| But EMCs of any size are not allowed within Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| We have not permitted any EMCs to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| Assuming by not permitting them, I would assume that that means that they would be considered problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| or objectionable by that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Mr. Beda, how will Turkey Creek development partners determine the usage by the individual businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| or the placement on this master sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Will you be charging rent for time to have that exposure on that sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I wanted to ask a couple of questions about this legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| This might bleed into the digital billboard legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| and I wanted just to kind of talk about the on-premise versus off-premise and that definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| and what is the difference, and just so that people hear this or understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| my understanding is only the businesses within the master sign plan are allowed to advertise on this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3696)|
| 1:01:49| on this development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| We got, when we were developing Turkey Creek, we got in the middle of the off-premise sign debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3712)|
| 1:02:02| And in order to have a master sign, we had to come up with the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| And that allows the pole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Councilwoman Pelo met, she and I met probably within two weeks of her gaining office the first term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3734)|
| 1:02:26| and she pinned me down to the signs that we wanted in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And we then spent an extensive amount of time seven years ago with the signs that we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3750)|
| 1:02:40| Again, this was one of the signs that we've wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| We've been consistent the whole way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Part of that plan is to not allow the off-premise signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| and the on-premise sign and all the users on this sign have to be within the bounds of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3772)|
| 1:03:02| They cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| We would be in violation of city ordinances if we had anybody outside of Turkey Creek on that signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| They would be cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I have two quick questions, and then one sort of a process observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| For Mr. Donaldson, on the Turkey Creek exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| what we're actually voting on would be, in effect, allowing Turkey Creek to apply to have a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| and there would still be a whole review process on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| So this is setting up allowing master signage plans to think about having a sign like this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| This would enable a group of property owners to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| and submit a master sign plan application to the planning commission for its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| And then the second question I'm feeling really stupid about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| specifically what was adopted by MPC was actually what Mr. Seymour suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| And where is that in our packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Because I actually don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| It's labeled as Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| A says 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I don't think A is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| On page 3 of the AIS, under the recommendation, it's as modified to permit a 420-square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3859)|
| 1:04:31| So would it be what's in on page 1 of Exhibit A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| and just changing that 100 square feet to 420 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| And I have a process thing for how we do the discussion after all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Why don't we come back to it if it's processed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I think Mr. Bedwell, I think the ñ does anybody else have a question for Mr. Bedwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| For now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| We can let him sit down and he can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Was that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Now might be a good time for ñ but you haven't thought about how to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| No, I was just going to Councilman Frost because his light has been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Well, I was just going to ask sort of ñ there are a lot of different questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| And to move things along, whether we could sort of agree to talk about them, you know, a subject at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| Sometimes we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Well, sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| It feels like it's always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| I think given this, and there's so many variables here, I think there's some wisdom there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| But I still want to come to Councilman Frost and others who have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Well, I was going to, you know, talk about the Turkey Creek requested exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| I mean, first I want to applaud Turkey Creek for having the foresight not to allow these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| And have it ñ and ban them in their covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| They do, on the surface, have a good argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I sat down this afternoon with Mr. Seymour about the 100-acre threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| and how this can be aspirational for different parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| However, the issue I see with that is it would probably be next to impossible to assemble 100 contiguous acres of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3957)|
| 1:06:09| whether it's along Chapman Highway, Broadway, Magnolia, or Kingston Pike, to do something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| But I'd like to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I mean, really, if you think about how many parcels would have to be assembled to do something like that, it's a considerable task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| And if folks can get close or not so close, well, then they'll start coming asking for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| For, well, we've got fill-in-the-blank acres assembled, not 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| We're close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| And, you know, you can apply for a variance no matter the merits of the idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| And there's the possibility that, you know, Turkey Creek has one, somebody else is going to get one, and more and more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4009)|
| 1:06:58| So that's my concern with doing this in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| It's been good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| I've seen the one at Hamilton Place in the Chattanooga area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| And I think, you know, honestly, that Turkey Creek's pretty good right now, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| Others certainly can feel free to disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| But I'm concerned about starting this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| What's enough acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| There's only one place in town right now that can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| And people with less than that can legitimately cry foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| And here we go again with variances in this same debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| So I regret I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| This is a follow-up for Mr. Donaldson from Mr. Becker's last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| And that is, again, on this issue of a unified development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I don't see clearly in the amendment that's been presented to us whether or not a unified development needs to be under one ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| or one management entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| And I guess in consideration of Mr. Frost's comments, who else in the city could possibly qualify for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| I mean, the example was given of the Bearden tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Is there 100 acres in Bearden, first of all, that's contiguous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| And second of all, is it possible for a coalition like that to qualify under this language as it is written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Elsewhere within the section dealing with master sign plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| it says that a master signage plan application and a consent form signed by all the property owners for the unified development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4116)|
| 1:08:44| is what's required to kick it off to make applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| So a group of owners can come together and consent to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| And have you identified a unified development corridor that would qualify underneath this language outside of Turkey Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| We haven't looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Mr. Donaldson, you're saying that existing properties, commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| no matter how long they've been developed, strung out along a corridor, not necessarily even contiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| could come together in a coalition and apply for a master sign designation, master signage plan designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4158)|
| 1:09:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| And in doing so, would they lose any rights on their individual businesses for signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4173)|
| 1:09:43| If they agree to the conditions of the plan, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| So Mr. Seymour's scenario of businesses coming together along Broadway or along Magnolia or in Bearden to create a master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4190)|
| 1:10:12| I think what he's suggesting is that they might ask for a 400 or 400 plus square foot EMC for the entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| But whatever their request was for that master signage plan, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| And it would have to come to MPC and then council to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| And if they came and said, we want to have a big EMC, but we don't want to reduce any of our existing signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4234)|
| 1:10:43| or would they have the right because, well, billboards are considered businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| and the signs are a part of existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| They're not billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| They're not off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| But the signage on their existing businesses is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Would they have the legal right to refuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| But then I'm trying to figure out what rights they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| If they agree to the signage plan, have they given up all their other rights to their signage if it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| I agree that I'll do away with my existing signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| If that provision was part of the master sign plan, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| It would have to be documented within the plan what signs were permitted, what signs may be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4283)|
| 1:11:33| But once approved, the master sign plan would control those signs that would be allowed within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| So each property owner that signed on to the master signage plan would have given up whatever existing rights they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4301)|
| 1:11:50| and they would become subservient to that master signage plan for that property in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| That would be possible, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| In theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Not that it's very likely, but in theory that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Mayor, my question was along with Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| How could we isolate some of these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Do you want to propose something, Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I thought we were talking about Turkey Creek, but I can actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Well, if we want to talk about Turkey Creek, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Well, let me, for the process of this, Mr. Swanson, it's not clear to me if we adopt option A, unamended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4344)|
| 1:12:33| it's not clear to me whether we're including the Turkey Creek option as we're calling it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| Can you tell me, do we have to amend it to put in 420 feet or should we amend it to take it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| I think I would probably defer to Mr. Donaldson with regard to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| because he understands what's in there a little better probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| The recommendation that came from the planning commission is slightly different than the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| that was provided by staff in that they amended the staff recommendation to include the 420 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| for master sign plan areas that have more than 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| So it already includes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Now, you might want to amend that because I think they volunteered to amend that down to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| But it's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| And if what you wanted to do, what they have requested tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| then you would simply move to amend that down to the 420 down to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| It's already part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| So F actually, we should all scratch out 100 there and write in 420 is what's F on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| In effect, that's what's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Is there anything else in that that was changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Did the 20 square foot or the area of one third change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| That whole paragraph would have to be changed to reflect the language of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4430)|
| 1:13:58| So the 20 square foot would be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| The 100 feet would be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And where is that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| It's in the planning commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| It would be both in the AIS and the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4450)|
| 1:14:20| But where's the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| There is not specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| The specific language would have to be crafted out of the planning commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| because there are two references to areas, the 20 square feet and the 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| and a reference to the 33 percent maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| which given that the maximum sign area on a development directory sign within 500 feet of the interstate is 400 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4481)|
| 1:14:54| you would then be granting 100 percent of that sign area as EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| if you go along with the recommendation by the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Mr. Seymour, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| Mr. Swanson, since we actually don't have language now doing what MPC said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4513)|
| 1:15:26| anybody can jump in and finish that sentence if they have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| I'm just going to turn my light off and I don't know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| All right, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| You know, I think before we start quibbling about the language of the master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| I guess I'd like to throw out my discomfort with the whole concept of this master signage plan exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| While I appreciate Turkey Creek Development Partners' sensitivity to sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| and I applaud their development of a master sign plan when they made this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| you're wanting to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| I agree, but I don't know what to do to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| I don't know how to make a motion to do what you're trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Let her finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| I guess while I appreciate everything that Turkey Creek Partners has done in terms of eliminating sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| and developing a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| I really have an issue with supporting this master signage plan amendment to the EMC language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| because it appears in every way, every angle I have looked at it, to only benefit one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| And I just don't think that I don't see how this council can pass something that only benefits one entity within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| no matter how deserving they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And I certainly recognize the advantages that the Turkey Creek Development has brought to the city of Knoxville in more ways than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| The sheer size of this sign to me evokes the digital billboards that this council has already banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4624)|
| 1:17:15| And I don't see how in good conscience we can continue to support a ban on digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| and yet allow this, albeit built into a monument structure, which is essentially a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| So I'm not making a motion, but I guess I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| I don't feel like I can support an option that includes this master signage plan option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| because it just feels to me like it too specifically is crafted to benefit one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4658)|
| 1:17:48| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Well, I guess in a way I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| And I guess my question is what my tendency would be to say, well, then I'd move to delete X, but there isn't an X there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| I'm not quite sure what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Well, I think what you would do under those circumstances, Mr. Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| is you would move to adopt the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommendation deleting the master signage plan portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4680)|
| 1:18:11| Would that do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Actually, Anita has crafted language that will work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| So we could do this on the floor if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| I'd be glad to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| And I think this nails it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| To reflect the Planning Commission recommendation, Article V, Section 10A30 would read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| a development directory sign approved as part of a master signage plan may incorporate one electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| as an integral part of a business ground or monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| and shall have a minimum matrix area of 20 square feet and a maximum matrix area of 400 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| on unified developments of 100 acres or larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Such signs shall be identified on and constructed in accordance with an approved master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| But what they're suggesting is they don't want that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| They want the rest of it without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| I think what I'm talking about is Exhibit A, Option A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| which is listed as staff recommendation with the deletion of bullet point number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| which is allowing the master signage plan piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| Now, that doesn't get us into Options B and following, which all involve banning new EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| which I would like to have a discussion on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| But since we were just on the master sign plan issue, I guess I could make a motion to amend Option A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4783)|
| 1:19:52| and then we would have Option A amended, and then we could go forward with the discussion of Option A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| in relationship to the other options that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Do you want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| I will make that motion to amend Exhibit A, Option A, bullet point number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| Well, we do have one little problem that we don't have an original motion to amend yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| There's nothing on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| Then I guess I'm not ready to make a motion because I'm not sure I want to be the maker of the motion to adopt Option A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| I'm going to go to Vice Mayor Brown since he hasn't spoken yet, and then I'll go to Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| This has been a good conversation, a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| And while I understand some of the concerns expressed by some of my fellow council members about the state of affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4840)|
| 1:20:50| as it exists today with regards to the applicability of the master signage plan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| I am a little concerned that we are not thinking with regards to that issue in a forward way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4858)|
| 1:21:06| and that while today this may not be or may seem today to be something that applies only to Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| as a council we're also charged with trying to do planning and putting recommendations together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| that would hopefully be enforceable in the future and also have applicability in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| No one knows what would happen in the future with regards to the applicability of this particular issue on a larger track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| Right now we can't visualize or grasp a piece of property or land where this hundred square feet of contiguous property is together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4891)|
| 1:21:41| to bring up this issue, but it may occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| And when it does occur, where do we go then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| Are we going to try and be progressive today and plan towards that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| Well, I understand that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| I'm wondering if we're kind of limiting ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Now, I was sitting here thinking about, you know, if you go upstairs to the city council vaults, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| and you look back at some of the old records that are written in quill and some of the things that were passed then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| when the city of Knoxville was in East Knoxville, you know, those folks back then would have limited themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4929)|
| 1:22:18| in some of the things they would be doing if they hadn't thought progressively, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| And so I wonder if we are in our haste to try and say we're not trying to favor one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| if we're not limiting ourselves with what could be a good piece of legislation that could be very beneficial in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4947)|
| 1:22:36| And I wonder if that's the posture we would be putting ourselves in by our concern that this may, at least today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| seem like it's benefiting, you know, one particular entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| We have had examples, and I was sitting here trying to think of a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| that over the period of time I've been here governing where we have enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| or taken an action because a specific issue popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| That's the first time, Mr. Firsttime, this issue has popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| It's the first time it has arisen and we addressed it for that specific purpose, knowing that this may occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| And if it does, now we have an answer on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And I wonder if we should not maybe broaden our thinking to realize that in governing, sometimes you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| The very first good idea is a response to usually a singular issue that pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| And it's a response to that issue in the hopes that in the future, if it pops up, we now have a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| And so I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| You know, when I look at what I think our goals are here, and we've had probably five or six discussions jointly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| and as Mr. Greaves says, it's to preserve and enhance our views and our scenery, natural beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| and to remove visual pollution and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| When I look at this, I think that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I think they took it upon themselves to remedy themselves of 150 freestanding signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| I think that's how many you could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Somewhere in that neighborhood, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| And so they eliminated 150 freestanding signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| They took down, I think you said, six billboards in the process of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| And to me, this is a case where we're going to reduce a lot of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| It sets a good precedence for future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| If this is 100 and plus acres and that's too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| well, maybe we ought to discuss lowering that down to 50 plus acres or 25 plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| And you mentioned Bearden or Fountain City or Chapman Highway and some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| Well, if you could collectively get some of those communities to take down all their signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| and reduce all that eye pollution and put up something similar to this, I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| And I think they've taken it upon themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Imagine what that would look like if you didn't have something like this in the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| And I'm not a supporter of any kind of signs, digital billboards, EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| I mean, I look forward to discussion on banning EMCs with the exception of these large parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5114)|
| 1:25:23| And I think this is appropriate for we're talking about in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| We're not talking about the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| We're not talking about the countryside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| We're talking about in the city, on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| I don't think this would be appropriate in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| But if you look at where this is, I think it's well suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| I think this is a good example of good signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| And I think that I don't agree with everything in this, but I think this is something that we ought to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| And it's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| And I think that others will follow and that we should have some discussion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| But I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I think these developers have intended, have done this in good faith, and I want to honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| I have to thank Councilman Brown and Vice Mayor Brown and Councilman Bailey for their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| You know, seven, I guess it was eight years ago now, right after I was elected, I think it might have been before I took office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5179)|
| 1:26:29| I saw this fellow sitting at a table and I knew that he seemed to know me and I couldn't figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| And so I told my husband, you go on back to the office, I'll be there in a few minutes, go see what this guy's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| And I'm just going to tell you, it's very personal with me because suddenly I was going to represent this very large area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5202)|
| 1:26:51| which had great promise for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| But also at the same time, I was looking at how are we going to do this in a way which my fellow councilmen can agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5213)|
| 1:27:06| And I was so very, very concerned about the visual pollution that I could seize to me from all this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5226)|
| 1:27:15| And so I went over and said, hi, I'm Barbara Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| And I remember him saying, I know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| And I thought, oh, I don't know how this is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| And we had a nice little conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And I said, gosh, you and I need to get to know each other because we want to be friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| Well, the incredible end of the story is that are we ever friends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| And have these gentlemen who had the vision for this development, they have been such good stewards of a very large tract of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5259)|
| 1:27:50| which the city had really seen a lot of, speaking of vision, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| the city had had the vision to do the infrastructure which could help this become developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| And it has really been a tribute to Knoxville, a tribute to them, and something that many people come from other areas to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5282)|
| 1:28:10| Now, did they need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| And when we began to talk about it, did I realize it was going to cost them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| Maybe some of their tenants, because some of these large box tenants have requirements of certain signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5300)|
| 1:28:28| And if that can't be accomplished, they will decide to go elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| But fortunately, this is a group of people who were able to convince their tenants that this would be a good decision for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5312)|
| 1:28:41| And, you know, I see opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| Every time I go to MPC, it seems out east there's a lot of property that has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| It will be someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| And I think this is just a standard that has been set for anyone who looks at a large area and wishes to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5335)|
| 1:29:05| And I'm excited to think that this council might be the standard bearers for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5345)|
| 1:29:14| And I truly appreciate what they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| I appreciate the fact that some of their tenants are very anxious who are not adjacent to interstate, need to have some visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5357)|
| 1:29:29| And they're working through some very difficult economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| I don't even know that that's really an issue, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| because we are trying to adopt standards which assist keeping Knoxville beautiful and the scenic Knoxville program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| And I think in doing so, that instead of punishing in some way a developer of a large tract of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| instead we need to applaud them and we need to uphold their standards that other developers will look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| And, you know, I can see, of course, I remember Fountain City when it was just a wonderful little village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| And when it didn't have so much solution, I can remember when the pylons came down on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| And that was so exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| I mean, actually, their tenants had to agree to give up their signage and what do you call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5421)|
| 1:30:29| piggyback their signage onto one pylon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| So, you know, many of our businesses in West Knoxville have assisted the Turkey Creek Partners in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5432)|
| 1:30:41| I believe there will be other areas of the city that are going to look for this kind of look in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5441)|
| 1:30:51| So thank you, Vice Mayor Brown, for the comments you made and Mr. Bailey also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| And I want to support this because I want to show the gratitude to the vision that this group of developers have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5457)|
| 1:31:08| in trying to assist us in making Knoxville a more beautiful place to live and a great place to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Councilman Pelo, I respect what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| and you know I have an enormous amount of respect for the work that you've done on behalf of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| You were right in many ways when other people were wrong, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| I would say, though, that they limited the sign pollution in the EMCs because it looks better, not so they could have this new sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5493)|
| 1:31:45| That was a choice they made because it makes for a much more cohesive, intelligent, better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| So this idea that they did this so that they could have this digital billboard, I don't think that's really in their thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5513)|
| 1:32:05| They did it because it makes more sense and people find it more pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| They did, but they also had some agreements with some of their tenants that they would work toward an opportunity for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| In a sense, it is off-premise because it's off-premise for those particular locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| I appreciate the comments from Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| I'm not so much persuaded by the equity issue as much as it is that we've decided not to have any more digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| And this, to me, seems that we are allowing a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| I'm much more persuaded by option C and D, and I look forward for us getting to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5559)|
| 1:32:49| Okay, I'm going to go to Councilman Holquist, and I'll come back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| I think I agree with Councilman Woodhull, and I appreciate everyone's comments, including Councilman Pillow's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| but I think I agree with Councilman Woodhull pretty much in what I just heard him say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| Again, this sign, as they show it on the graphic that they've given us copies of here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5587)|
| 1:33:14| is a large district-wide master plan sign that is supposed to identify the entire district or development in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5594)|
| 1:33:26| one that fronts the interstate, and then, of course, I guess there's one at each entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| That's a legitimate concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| The problem is when you get into the EMC part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| And as Mr. Bedwell said, that space is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| That changeable message area is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| And so really what you're doing there is allowing individual businesses to advertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| to market their own businesses or products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| And so it just becomes essentially a billboard to be used by the individual businesses selling their wares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| and selling their goods, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And I think it's very, very different from identifying a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| and establishing a sense of overall sense of place and area, and you're now entering Turkey Creek, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| To me, there's a bright line of definition that divides the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| And so while I have no problem with the concept of district signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| and signs that identify a master plan or a master sign plan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| I do have a tremendous problem with the digital billboard and, again, our digital large EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| and I think it does put us in danger crossing that line for digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Councilman Becker, I'll come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| I'm actually going to try to make a motion, which I don't think we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| There's nothing on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Let me first off ask Mr. Swanson and Mr. Donaldson a process question about option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| And this is one that says ban new EMCs while requiring existing EMCs to meet operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| and locational characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| My assumption is that the operational characteristics that are in A are also in D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| because this includes the operational characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Let me go ahead then and make a motion to adopt the ordinance first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| No, we don't have a motion on the ordinance yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| So a motion to adopt the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| If nobody seconds it, we can all go home real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| There's a second from Ms. Zarate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| I'd like to move to amend the ordinance to substitute option D for option A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5741)|
| 1:35:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| And that probably is a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Is somebody leaning on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Are you leaning on your button?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Anyway, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| I guess the next step, to keep it on the Turkey Creek discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| let me make a motion to amend whatever is in there now, which I'm not sure about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and put in the language that is on our page, option A on page 1F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5770)|
| 1:36:19| Mr. Becker, let me suggest to you that it would be perhaps cleaner, easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| and perhaps more legal if we just do the amendments one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| So maybe the best thing to do is consider amendment one being to adopt D rather than A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| and then move from there to amend further as amendment number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| Would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Because there's a lot I don't like about D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| and I don't know if I want to vote on D yet before we get D straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| But you've got to have something you're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| You can vote to amend it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| I think what you're saying is get the motion on the floor, then move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| It is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| The ordinance is on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| but your motion to amend number one would be to substitute D for A, essentially, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| And we adopt that and then move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Adopt that and then move to amendment number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| Because then you're not going back to the motion as amended yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| so that takes care of your, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| You haven't voted on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| You're just amending it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Right now there's a motion on the floor and then a motion to amend, which would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| And I guess what we're doing then is we're deciding we're going to talk about D as opposed to, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| So there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| And then you also seconded the motion to amend D for A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| So right now the discussion is on the motion to the floor, which is to amend D for A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5870)|
| 1:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| I'm going to go to Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| I have a question on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| The way I read option D, it does not contain any language allowing the Turkey Creek proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I would, again, defer to Mr. Donaldson to make sure that that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| because he is more familiar with each of these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| So one could vote in favor of Exhibit D and Turkey Creek is still not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5904)|
| 1:38:35| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| I'm just making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| I'm sorry, there's no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Then the motion on the floor is to amend with D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Any other discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Is there any merit in maybe Mrs. Mitchell reading, just for folks that may be following this at home or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| to read into the record what option D is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Have that in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Option D is to ban new EMC acceptable changeable price signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| while requiring existing EMC to meet amended operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| and locational characteristics and consideration of amortization of all existing EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5956)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Okay, now back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| I'm getting to it like I was at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| about to be out here on this aisle and not understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| So if I'm clear here with regards to D, which I've got some questions about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| and I don't know that can be resolved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| And, you know, we've got a whole cost component there to D that I don't know if Ms. Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| and those folks have thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| But when you're talking about coming up with an inventory and staffing to come up with an inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| and do all that, that's a whole other issue that we need not discuss today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| I kind of wanted to, is it easier, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| and you probably understand this stuff a little better than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| what you're trying to do to try to take the components of D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| and bring them forward into A instead of trying to take D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| and take some of those components from A back to D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| I sense that you were trying to get there's something in both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| And I might be able to follow that along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| but I don't know which is better to start with D and build up on D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| or to start with A and pare it down to where, you know, you get to D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| For example, you know, obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| this doesn't deal with the government on signs and exemptions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| And I think there's some valid reasons for those exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| I understand that Scenic Knox doesn't think we should do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| and somehow that, you know, exempts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| But government gets those kinds of considerations for all sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| not because we're government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| because what we have to do in providing services to the public kind of puts us in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| that sometimes we need to put ourselves in a little different position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| So I just posed that out there to see if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Part of the reason, Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| I wanted to talk about D is because D seems the most to include most of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| And actually I would have thought that the Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| and the government on signs, what are on Exhibit A, page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Now, I would have thought that they're in D, but they might not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| So D seemed the one that had everything in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| So we talk about D to talk about everything and then start paring down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| That seemed easier to move forward on than starting at A and adding stuff to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| So that's why I chose D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| And now we hear that it may not include D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| Well, we're going to add some stuff, I think, and then we're going to take stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| I would like to address Mr. Vice Mayor's concern about the amateurization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| which I think is what you mentioned recently and the cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| And, Mr. Swanson, if I understand this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Option D reads that we would ask MPC to consider developing an amortization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6129)|
| 1:42:17| And down at the bottom of page, it says page three, but it's the cover sheet for Option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| It has some items that should be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| I would presume that if that amortization program comes back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| and we decide that it's unaffordable, then at that point we could ditch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| I mean, this is not binding in terms of that amortization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| I think that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| There is no fully completed amortization plan in this particular option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| It's only a develop and implement a plan, and you have to go through a process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| And that process is not included in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Option D includes that as a request for further study, but we're not bound by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| I think that's good to make that valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| I appreciate that, because the perception maybe would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| if this is passed going away from here, that that is going to be put into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| because I remember one speaker specifically speaking to that issue very passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| So I'm glad we have it on the record, and I appreciate you bringing that out, Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| So we're very clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| because then you look at D, and D may not be everything that everyone thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Right now we have an amended motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| There's a motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| A motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| That's a good correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Seeing no other lights, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| All those in favor of amending the motion, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Let me just do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| I heard Hall, Pelow, and Brown as nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Did I miss anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| And for the record, Bailey was absent at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| So we had five ayes and three nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| I have a motion going on to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| And we keep calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| I guess this is a master sign plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| Mr. Swanson and Mr. Donaldson have opined that there's no language in D on master sign plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| So let me suggest for purposes of discussion, because I think there actually is some value in encouraging master sign plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6275)|
| 1:44:45| There's some value to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| There's some language on option A, page 1F there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| And I don't know if this works, but to get the discussion going, I would like to amend option D to include this language under F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6292)|
| 1:45:03| which is the, you know, for discussion of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| And maybe we could put off Turkey Creek until we actually talk about the ban, because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6310)|
| 1:45:18| Didn't we say, pardon me, that the language in F on option A is incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| Well, but it's not in option A, but it's on our paper that says option A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| So if it's incorrect, I would make a motion on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| I guess, actually, for process-wise, we probably shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| We've been talking about Turkey Creek, and maybe we ought to start talking about the ban first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| because if we're banning things, it doesn't matter what size master sign plans get, because it's banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| So they don't get any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| I guess I'm going to make a kind of a challenging motion, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6358)|
| 1:46:09| I like the idea of some kind of a ban on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6369)|
| 1:46:20| I actually don't like allowing changeable price signs, because I think there's some significant challenges with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| But I also think we've got to be more strategic about our ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| And I'll start this discussion just by saying my sense, and other people can add what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| But at some level, we have a very diverse city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| and Emory Road is very different from the South Waterfront, from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| from what Magnolia or Cumberland or Central Avenue might become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| And I don't know that we can live with a one-size-fits-all on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| And it's sort of why I like some of the stuff that's talked about in master sign plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| and I understand we actually have got some very strong sign requirements in South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| And I don't know quite how we get to this, but at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| I would love to be able to say that some things are allowed in some places and not in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| I'd like to have a complete ban on electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| including changeable price signs on Magnolia Avenue and Central and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| But I don't know that that makes sense for Emory Road or Straw Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| And I'm not sure how to do this with Kingston Pike or Broadway as it goes through Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| It seems much more complicated to say a one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| So I don't have a motion coming out of this yet, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| I have a thought of what I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| And, yes, Mr. Swanson, your job will be to make this into a motion at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| So you're right to wrinkle your head, and you're right to also know that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| you're not getting the game until halftime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| But I'll toss that out as far as a ban goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| and I don't know what other people are thinking on bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| And if somebody has a motion, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pelo next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Well, I kind of have a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| When I start thinking about signage, there's one person I generally call first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| and that's Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| And I don't think she has had an opportunity to make any comments in a recent meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| I think we excluded some folks that could have been very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| Ms. Cash, is there a comment you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| Is this a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| I just want to call your attention to the provisions of the Master Sign Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| if you get back to considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| And Councilmember Frost talked about asking for variances earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| if you approve the Master Sign Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| The Master Sign Plan specifically prohibits people from asking for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| That was put in there when it was originally written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| That is, the existing Article 5, Section 10A, 29I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| says the Master Sign Plan is a privilege rather than a right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| and you are prohibited from seeking variances for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| If you proceed with adopting the Option D as it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| and I know that Councilwoman Pelo and Councilwoman Roddy are well aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| You ladies remember a number of years ago when we did the original amendment to these EMC regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| The thing that started that was the gentleman selling these EMCs out of the back of his trunk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| and they were so small that that's what started this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| And if you look at these changeable price sign proposals, there is no minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| And the maximum is 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| So I just wanted to call that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| I think Councilman Holquist is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| I think that's right now, if I can remember what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6604)|
| 1:50:13| Well, it better come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Hopefully it will come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| And very valid points from Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Back to the Master Signage Plan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| I guess because there's so many issues here, we're going to tend to just jump around like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| I'm not trying to not have the discussion about what do we ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| But back to the Master Signage Plan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| earlier some of the concerns were expressed that it seems to apply only to a specific development here in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6637)|
| 1:50:44| because of the 100-acre issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I wonder if among my council members in the Master Signage Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| which I, too, agree that has great benefits not only for the existing development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| but potential development in other areas of this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| is would it be something for consideration that that 100-acre threshold maybe be lowered to a 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6659)|
| 1:51:08| or 50 acres or more, which still would cover, I guess, this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| but would allow us to get into some of those possibilities in the future that Councilman Becker was speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| when you're dealing with other parts of this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| where you may be able to put together some particular development projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| and get some folks to voluntarily come in and help reduce signs by dealing with the sign that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| So those folks who just had heartburn about this seems to maybe be just singling out one specific development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| I wonder if that's their major concern or is it a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| and would that still be the concern if we lowered that from 100 acres or more down to another level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| which would actually expand fairly quickly the potential of other developments falling under the Master Signage Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6706)|
| 1:51:55| and, therefore, maybe bringing that benefit of having less signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| and more of a one-sign situation like we've got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| And for those folks who have had concerns about it, I'd kind of like to want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| Not to put anybody on the spot, but I'm just wondering if that is something that's a viable consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| because I do think that a Master Signage Plan, from what I understand about it thus far and from what I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| could be very beneficial not only out there at Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| but in some of the other areas of the city as they're being developed or may be developed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Councilman Huckless, do you have it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| It had to come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| Going back to what Mr. Becker said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| about South Waterfront examples of maybe having different standards for different parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| I think we need to set a clear, bright-line, baseline standard, and I think that's what Option D does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6765)|
| 1:52:54| As far as districts, special zoning districts with a comprehensive code like South Waterfront's form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| which we will hopefully have soon on Cumberland Avenue and the near part of North Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6782)|
| 1:53:10| that's a comprehensive code that includes signage and design guidelines and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| And I think when we get down to specific districts like that that have a comprehensive code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6794)|
| 1:53:21| I think then we can address variations on the theme, so to speak, that allow some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6801)|
| 1:53:30| Now, I personally would like to see a very clear ban or language that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| these EMCs are banned everywhere, period, so that that's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| and so when we get into these other codes we don't try to work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| And I don't know how that would work legally, but I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| I think you alluded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I think you understand that, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Yeah, I think I'm following up a little bit on what Mr. Holquist said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| and that is if Option D is passed as our preference that bans new EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| then I'm not quite sure how you keep the issue of a master sign plan alive underneath that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| But if we find a way to do that and we start talking about lowering the threshold to be a part of that kind of exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6852)|
| 1:54:22| I guess I would need more research from MPC to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| because what I don't see in our current language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| our current language takes into account all of the planning and the master sign coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| that one entity, Turkey Creek, has done in their development to say that, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| the Bearden merchants could get together and form a coalition under a smaller amount of acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| say 50 acres, or the Magnolia Avenue merchants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| and then the sign would still have to be adjacent to the interstate the way this is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| But what's not in there is what they would give up under a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| I mean, I think we're all sort of envisioning, okay, Magnolia Avenue gets together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| or Fountain City gets together and takes down a bunch of signs in exchange for this advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| but that language isn't in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| And to me, that requires going back and hammering out some details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| And I don't feel that we have at this point a possibility for a 100-acre coalition to fall underneath this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6923)|
| 1:55:33| other than the Turkey Creek partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Now, I heard Vice Mayor Brown say that maybe that wasn't thinking progressively enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| But, you know, if lowering it to 75 or 50 acres provides that possibility, great, I'm willing to entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| If this does not benefit one entity and one entity alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| but then it's got to be rethought in terms of what is involved in a master sign plan agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| If you get this benefit for becoming a coalition, then what do those members of that coalition agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6956)|
| 1:56:04| And that's not hammered out here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| I'm going to just pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| You're hesitant to come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Well, no, I'm just trying to make certain we're being fair here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| I guess I actually have some language here to talk about in moving towards my vision of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| And, Mr. Swanson, if you want to listen closely, on option D, number one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| where it says no EMC except for a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| What I'd almost like to say on that is just say no EMC, where does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| Shall be permitted in any location after the effective date of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| except those in an H1 or a D1 overlay, a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| or any special zoning district that allows EMCs with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Now, tell me that's a great idea, just to make me happy for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7023)|
| 1:57:12| I guess really what I need to do with that proposed language would be to ask Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7032)|
| 1:57:22| whether in his view that that is substantially different than anything that was considered by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| or whether it comes within the general penumbra of things that were considered by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| and, therefore, we can do without sending it back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| What's your thought on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| We certainly had discussion regarding the use of H1 and D1 as exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| We had discussion about the master sign plan as an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| Probably the only thing other than that hadn't been discussed would be the other zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| and there is language in the code that allows a specific zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| to more or less trump the supplemental regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| May be able to do that without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Then in light of that response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| then I would say that if you want to offer that as amendment number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| then that's something that you could possibly do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| although I'm not a court reporter and have not taken it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| And so I'm going to need that language and I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| Go ahead, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| It's actually in the packet, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| If you look at page two of agenda item number six from MPC, it's the 1E1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7126)|
| 1:58:55| 1E1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Excluding item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| It's items B, C, and D is what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| I'm not seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Is that not what you said, Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| An EMC may be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| That would actually be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| I mean, I always like my language as I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| I think you said no new EMCs except for B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| And E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Well, and then the thing this other districts allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| I mean, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Ms. Cash, I don't see where the language is that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Could you give me that reference again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| If you look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Well, I don't know where I got this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| If you look in the ‑‑ it starts out recommended amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| Every page kind of says that at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| We think it may be the second page of option A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| And there's 1E1ABCB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| I've got that language now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| And 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Now, did you add something other than what is there other than B, C, and D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| I think, I mean, my ‑‑ I don't read, again, what I vaguely wrote down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| No EMC shall be permitted at any location after the effective date of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| except those in an H1 or D1 overlay, a master sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| or any special zoning district that allows EMCs with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| So it's only that last one that's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| So we need the particular language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| We have under that language B, C, and D are the first three things that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| But the last thing that you said I don't think is covered there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| so give me that specific language one more time, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| Or any special zone district that allows EMCs with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| Do we have any of those yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Hmm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Do we have any of those yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| Well, no, because we allow EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| This would ‑‑ I mean, we've got ‑‑ we've sort of got two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| If we want some sort of surgical ban, we can ban them everywhere and allow them to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| Or we can do sort of what we're doing now, which is allow them everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| and have them excluded, which is what we've done in South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| I kind of agree with Mr. Holquist in saying that the idea of the baseline being none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| and then you allow special places where they are allowed is a smarter way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| Like H1, D1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| But what I was asking is you're covering B, C, and D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| and then your fourth thing was or any other special district that allows them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| That's sort of a coverall for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| We don't have any other that are not mentioned specifically here that allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| It is the coverall for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| It is, in effect, saying that while we're banning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| we're open to the idea that special districts can decide they do want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| But we make a special district of Oakwood-Lincoln Park and they want EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| and then they're allowed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| Yeah, and that's ‑‑ it's a funky ‑‑ well, it's funky because we don't quite know what the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| but we know how we do special zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| We know how we do overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| I think what it implies is we'll figure out exactly how that process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| but we're open to having a process that would allow an area, be it Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| be it Straw Plains Pike, Emory Road, to say, yeah, we want these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| Or EMCs except in specifiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| Yeah, that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| Councilman ‑‑ oh, sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Could I ask one question about this language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Because it says an EMC may be permitted as a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7383)|
| 2:03:11| within an area covered by a master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| but it doesn't have the details of what the requirements are for that EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7394)|
| 2:03:21| Are you adopting those from somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| You mean the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| The size of the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| The brightness and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| That's what a directory sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| My motion didn't actually say directory sign, and I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Yes, I think we would at some point have to say, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| If we're saying signs are allowed in H1 and D1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| we know how those work because those are existing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| I think ‑‑ I don't understand master sign plans quite well enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| and I'll trust Mr. Donaldson that the language there works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| that there's already a process set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| and it might be they're allowed only as a whatever it is you just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| But, yes, we'd have to adopt some standards on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| I think the standards are already ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| We have two options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| We have the staff recommendation to add paragraph F to Article V, Section 10A30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7450)|
| 2:04:19| which laid out the maximum 100 square feet and 33% of the sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7459)|
| 2:04:26| And then we have the Planning Commission recommendation to amend that to 420 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| So you could choose either of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| For your information also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| the master sign plan regulations are very specific as to what can go on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| So they can only, even if you approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| they can only display the name of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| and the name of the business on that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| And, Council Member Hulk, with the development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| there's already a definition for that in the master sign plan criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| Vice Mayor Brown, I think it might be your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| Yeah, okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Was there a second on Mr. Becker's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| So we can go ahead with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Because I think he's getting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Because I know I spend a lot of time talking about the master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| and he's now expanding to some of the other areas I was going to be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| and a little concerned about by dealing with some of these districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| and adding them into this exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Because I did have questions now that we were dealing with D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| and to try to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Like, for example, and tell me if I'm right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| or tell me how would we define the Tennessee Theater sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| That's H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| No, I understand the district where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| But tell me, Mr. Dawson or Ms. Cash, what is that sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| That would be an example of running lights on a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| Is it an EMC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| Yes, it is an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| It's an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| And what we have out in front of the convention center is an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| What we have down at the Civic Coliseum is an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| So without the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| And the Bisho's new sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| And the Bisho's new sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| And the Riviera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| And the Riviera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| And tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| And tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| And if we don't find some way to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| those individuals under D are going to be required to meet amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| operational and locational characteristics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| Would that be true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| So I think that's why I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| I think Councilman Becker, it's actually a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and it's getting me to some of the concerns I had because that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| other big ball of wax I was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| not only from the government pieces that are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| but I remember when this council, and it's kind of interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| I don't think Councilmember Roddy was on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| but I remember when we dealt with the Tennessee theater sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| we rushed in here and did that band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| And then we turned right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Were you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| And we rushed in and did that band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| And in that meeting we had to go out of that boat so that we could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| that as an exception for a special situation and only entity that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| going to apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| And then we went back and did our band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| So that's another thing I get concerned about when we don't kind of think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| a little bit outside the box with what we're doing now and everybody is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| contributing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| So I like the amendment and I think it's getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| This is kind of like, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| what they say you don't want to see them make the meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| Sausage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| This isn't pretty, making this sausage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| But I got a feeling we're going to have something that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| palatable at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| So I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| And I think we're covering some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Good job, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| And everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Mr. Donaldson, can you point me to something that defines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| or sets a minimum area that can be governed by a master signage plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7689)|
| 2:08:18| For example, if I owned half an acre on Broadway in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| can I have my own master signage plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| I believe you have the right to apply for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7709)|
| 2:08:37| but it is a privilege and it's not guaranteed for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| But there needs to be some criteria in place in order to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| or not it's objective standards rather than subjective standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7726)|
| 2:08:55| There's a provision in the code that sets the minimum area at 25,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| feet and requires at least three or more businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| so roughly a little more than half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| So, for example, a strip mall on fill-in-the-blank pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7750)|
| 2:09:17| or highway within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| If this proposal goes in, they can create their own master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| Then we will start having lots of EMCs is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| I don't think we need to make sure what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7773)|
| 2:09:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Do master sign plans come to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| Do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Is there sort of a review process like it would be on a C6 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| They're reviewed under the use-on-review procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| so the planning commission has the approval authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| and then there is an appeal available to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| It would come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| An appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| It feels a little risky to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| I'm inclined to say we sort of had a challenge figuring out what language we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| were working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| and what I'd love to have for second reading is sort of what we've done today all put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| together on one piece of paper and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| actually see because I have a feeling there might be some additional challenges to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| That feels like a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| We might come out of this and we might even decide before we adopt it we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| look more closely at some of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| and I think that before second reading we've got to do some good thinking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| But I'd like to give people the opportunity to figure out ways to get these in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| appropriate locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| the amendment that we are considering that Mr. Becker put forward and Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| Mayor Brown seconded amends option D with what language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| Could you read those exceptions to the ban on EMCs, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| Except that one EMC may be permitted as a development directory sign within an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| area covered by a master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| or an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by an H1 overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| or an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| should be a D1 overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| or any special zone district that allows EMCs with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7890)|
| 2:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| That's what I thought we were considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| I cannot support this amendment with the inclusion of item number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| which is the master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| because I just think it's not fully baked yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| I think these issues of lowering the acreage to allow more entities within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| city to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| the issues of whether or not what's the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| as Councilman Frost said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| to apply for a master signage plan is not really well defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| and the issue of what does a master signage plan district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| or coalition have to give up in exchange for this privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| All of those questions to me are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I'm willing to consider master signage as a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| but I need it to be fully fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| So I guess I could make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| or I could just vote against that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| and then we could re-amend depending on where that went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| But I can't support it as it is with item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| I agree with Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| You know, to a degree, I have to say I kind of agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| There are a lot of things about a master signage plan that would worry me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| There's some language, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| in any zoning district that could allow them that kind of frightens me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| because I'm not sure how all that could work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| I'd like to ask, at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| I'm very confused because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| we're getting Charles to read something to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| and, you know, it's sort of add this in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| and there's a bunch of other language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| I'd almost like to ask us to move forward some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| and get a look at all this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| and get some more information together because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| I don't know that much about master signage plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| and how they operate to be able to answer a lot of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| We could take it out and put it in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| If you want to make that amendment and see where it goes, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| We are on some fuzzy ground on what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| Just withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| You could simply change your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| along with the consent of your second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| to delete that particular language if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| But we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| We haven't voted on this amendment yet, so you can't amend it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| But you can just offer a different motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| than the one you originally started to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| as long as your second agrees to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| I could, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Or you may not if you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| Mr. Donaldson, some of the concerns that Councilmember Roddy brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8066)|
| 2:14:33| and I understand her concern and do share that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| especially the example that Councilman Frost put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| Attorney Frost put up doing some good lawyering over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| If this is passed on first reading between now and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| are there answers already existing either in drafts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| or considerations to get us here to address some of the concerns she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| with regards to minimum and maximum levels and what some of this means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| Some of the questions she asked, I wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| did we not already have answers to those prior to bringing A before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| If we already had those answers before to some of the questions she just brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| and then all we're looking at doing is trying to define out the minimum and maximums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| then maybe we can take those same answers and just apply them to the new dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8118)|
| 2:15:27| I think the answer lies within the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| The use and review process would flesh out those sorts of details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| and by having an approval by the Planning Commission that documents all of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8135)|
| 2:15:44| that will be allowed within the district, you will see in a plan what will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8144)|
| 2:15:51| It is at the discretion of the Planning Commission to allow sign package A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8151)|
| 2:15:58| versus sign package B, and it's up to the applicant to make the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| or to compel them to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| And the benchmark would be what's allowable under the current code without a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8167)|
| 2:16:17| And I apologize, my question may not have been a very well-crafted question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| to help you with giving an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| Council Member Roddy pointed out some very valid points and some pointed points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| and she said these are questions that are not answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| I guess my question to you is, between now and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| can we have some answers for her to be considered at second reading to see if she feels a little better about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8197)|
| 2:16:45| and if we all feel a little better about it, including Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| That's the question that I have, and where some of the questions that she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| where the answer is already considered at MPC through the deliberations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| so therefore we don't have to go all the way back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| And I don't know if she needs to repeat her question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| Well, one of them was will they be giving up in order to achieve what they are permitted under the sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8223)|
| 2:17:11| That isn't codified, but by going through the process and documenting those signs that are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8231)|
| 2:17:21| and comparing that to what's allowed under the current code, we have a handle on what they're giving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| I think with that question it's implicit that what you're giving up is your right to put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| pile-on sign in front of your building if you have that right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Or some other existing sign, so that can kind of be, I think, fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| But she has some other questions, and I'm sorry I can't spit them all back to you, but some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8259)|
| 2:17:46| I'm just wondering if between first and second reading can we get some level of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| so we can then consider on second reading whether or not we feel very comfortable with her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8272)|
| 2:18:00| It's possible that every master sign plan has a unique set of circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| that may have a unique set of allowed signs, which then would correspond to a unique set of signs given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8285)|
| 2:18:16| Literally everything is possible currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| I think Ms. Roddy, Councilman Frost, I understand your concerns about the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| Part of why I want to keep that in is I'm trying to have a good discussion here about all the options that have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| And at some level, if we take this out now, we don't get the opportunity to talk about the Turkey Creek option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8317)|
| 2:18:45| And I would hate to not have a discussion about that on first reading tonight because we've talked a lot about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| and it seems like maybe that's something we want to do, something we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| So I'd almost say I'd like to keep that in for now, pass this, talk about the Turkey Creek, see where that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8334)|
| 2:19:02| and potentially later tonight we might even want to take this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| But I'd like to put it in because it allows us a framework to have the discussions about the issues that have been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| In answer to that, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| what if we take option D and instead of putting the Turkey Creek, the master sign thing in as one of the four exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8355)|
| 2:19:28| add it to the consideration clause where we are asking that MPC consider amortization of all existing EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| and consider full development of a master sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| Because I think, again, there are so many questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| Another one would be if you have an assemblage of acreage, say we lower it to 50 acres, do they have to be contiguous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| Or can 50 acres worth in Bearden all agree without touching one another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| And what happens if one member of the coalition, their property sells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| They're in it, but then they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| Then do they get their sign back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| As Mr. Donaldson said, we have no codification of what you give up in terms of master planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| which I think is what we're trying to encourage, good development and better looking signage in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| And so the whole idea of a master sign thing is it's a carrot for development to do a better job of coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8419)|
| 2:20:27| And those incentives have to be laid out in a real specific manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| And particularly in case of a coalition member dropping out or the property being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| and I don't think any of this was considered fully by MPC before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| I mean, to me, that piece needs to go back under this consideration clause along with the amortization thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| and have that piece come back to us at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| I guess some of what you said, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8453)|
| 2:21:00| that wouldn't allow us to have the discussion about the Turkey Creek exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| And I don't know that I want, because if we take it out, then that whole thing is just sort of hanging out there as a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| And it feels like we need to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| And, frankly, I don't think we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| But I'd like to give somebody a clear answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| I mean, Mr. Bidwell has been good enough to come and has been talking about this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8482)|
| 2:21:28| My, I could be wrong about this, my sense is this council is going to say no to that 420-foot exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| And I don't want, if we're going to say no, I'd like to get him an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| So there's some of this that just, you know, we can't talk about everything at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| We have to have some kind of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| And that Roberts fellow, in no relation to me, decided how we do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| And I think this is the only way we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| So if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| My concern about the master signage, and you heard the minimum square footage of 25,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| For those of you who have been to my house, my lot, not my house, my lot is about 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8519)|
| 2:22:07| So just think of two and a half lots in my neighborhood that under this would allow to be, to have an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8527)|
| 2:22:19| That's, I mean, that's my real concern with even leaving this in to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8539)|
| 2:22:29| I'm not going to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| If somebody wants to amend it out, we can have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| I'm not going to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| Right now, then, that's what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| It does have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8564)|
| 2:22:45| Mr. Swanson, I just want to make sure, I want to make certain that I'm, I don't want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| Right now, what are we, what's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| What's before us is Mr. Becker's amendment number two, which adopts option D, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8573)|
| 2:23:06| On option D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| Except for those things that I just read a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| You want me to read them again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| Read them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| One EMC may be permitted as a development directory sign within an area covered by a master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8598)|
| 2:23:26| or an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by an H1 overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8606)|
| 2:23:32| or an EMC may be permitted in those areas covered by a D1 overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| or an EMC may be permitted in any special zone district that allows EMCs with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8619)|
| 2:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| That's what's on the floor before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| Anybody else want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Obviously, we can either, those of us that aren't comfortable with part one of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| we can either vote for it and then come back and amend it, or we can vote it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| and then put another amendment on the table for consideration that includes all the other components except for that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8650)|
| 2:24:21| having to do with the master signage plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| I guess my inclination is to vote it down and then amend again, excluding the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8665)|
| 2:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| We probably, well, let's do a roll call vote, I think, after all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8686)|

| 2:24:49| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| I heard five ayes and four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Did I have, did I, did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| So the message passes on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| Well, actually, you should amend, I'm sorry, excuse me, excuse me, I'm getting ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| Wishful thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| Miles to go before we sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| I want to make a motion to amend to exclude the first item having to do with Master Signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8722)|
| 2:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| There's, is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Second by Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| Discussion on this motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Parliamentarily, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| If we vote this down and then we have the discussion about Turkey Creek, the Turkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| Creek amendment, and we want to come back later in the meeting and do this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| again, are we prohibited from doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| If you vote, if you vote it down and then have the discussion about the Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Can we bring this motion up again later in the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| The motion to amend, like Councilman Holquist was talking about, if it, if it's defeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8766)|
| 2:26:12| and we have more discussion and then it is made again, we can bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| That's his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| Or, if, if the motion to delete item one about the Master Signage Plan passes but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8779)|
| 2:26:29| Council decides to bring it back as a consideration along with the amortization, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8789)|
| 2:26:35| possible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| That could be amendment number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| There's a motion to amend on the floor and there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| And I'm, I'm hoping that maybe Councilmember Roddy will jump in and help me out here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| her concerns as I once again try to talk to Mr. Donaldson about answers over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| And she's brought up some, some salient points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| And Councilmember Frost brought up, you know, his example about he may be putting the EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8823)|
| 2:27:09| in his yard once he turns around and buys a lot next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| And those are valid concerns because I don't think anybody's desire here is to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| And that's just, you know, a tribute to Councilmember Frost's great knowledge of our zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| being a good lawyer that he was able to pick that, find that hole very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| But over these next two weeks, some of the questions or concerns or gaps that need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| be filled, can that be done over the next two weeks with some answers from your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| or Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| You've got, you have a great handle on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| I've been impressed with what you've said and how you've been very quickly to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| out some other concerns here about D that we've kind of glossed over and no one still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| has gone back and talked about your example about the smaller signs and what folk can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8874)|
| 2:27:58| do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| And we're kind of looking at this bigger picture here and we still have that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| So I guess my question is over the next two weeks, can our technical folk give us a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| feel for some of these concerns and questions that have been brought forth by Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| And I think some of us share those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| We can plug those holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| We'll feel maybe a lot better about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| So I'm back once again to you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| You gave me a great, you know, answer that basically said that it will work itself out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| you know, in the process down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| But I think what I hear is that folk may want a better, more solid, concrete positioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8909)|
| 2:28:35| if they're going to even consider this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| Currently, there is little guidance within the code as far as the tradeoffs that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8921)|
| 2:28:49| be expected to gain approval of a Master Sign Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8929)|
| 2:28:56| There is a specified minimum area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| You could direct us to increase that or you could provide an alternative threshold just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8942)|
| 2:29:09| within the specific amendment that you're making on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8949)|
| 2:29:14| So there are multiple ways to address virtually every one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8954)|
| 2:29:22| The current code is fairly flexible because it requires that in order to gain approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8962)|
| 2:29:30| you have to be very specific about what you're going to do and lay everything out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8970)|
| 2:29:38| including all of the parameters that are used to determine maximum sign areas under normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8978)|
| 2:29:48| considerations so that we can then compare them to what's being approved in the sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| So does all that say that, yes, over the next two weeks you can put something in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| Or is that saying no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| We certainly can put together a list of issues and how they currently are addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| but if you were to ask us to provide for guidelines within the Master Sign language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| no, that's a significant exercise that won't be done in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| Do you have anything you'd like to add to that, Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| Well, I don't believe Councilman Becker's motion included the 100-acre size that was included in option A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9023)|
| 2:30:34| But if you have 100 acres, then it's not going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| If that's the minimum size that council approves to allow an EMC as part of a Master Sign plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9037)|
| 2:30:44| then it's not going to matter what the minimum size of a piece of property is that allows a Master Sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| a Master Sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| There are currently within the zoning ordinance regulations for the Master Sign plan that talks about you do have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9055)|
| 2:31:02| show the signs, the total signage that you would be allowed if you did not seek approval for a Master Sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9062)|
| 2:31:11| So you are showing what you would be allowed, and then here's your tradeoff of what you're going to provide instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9071)|
| 2:31:18| But if you include the language relative to a minimum size eligible for an EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9078)|
| 2:31:25| then, as I said, the minimum size to qualify for just a regular Master Sign plan without an EMC is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9085)|
| 2:31:35| And where's that 100 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| You said it's in A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| It's in option A that was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| It's in the recommendation that was made by the planning commission, which was to allow the 420 square feet for areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9102)|
| 2:31:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| I just wanted to know, where did the 100 plus acres come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| Mr. Seymour proposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| I thought that was Winnie the Pooh, 100-acre wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| We were trying to have an acceptable mass that would make a difference in parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9124)|
| 2:32:15| You could pick 80 acres if you wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| but we wanted a substantial mass that when you drove into that area you knew it was different than the rest of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9137)|
| 2:32:28| And that would encourage, then, other chunks of the same road to get better signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9148)|
| 2:32:36| And that language, Councilman Bailey, can be found in the second and third page from the back of that packet in the MPC minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9156)|
| 2:32:49| It starts at the bottom of that page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| It's in bold, and it goes to the top of page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| Joe, I'm going to come back to you if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| Okay, I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| Just to clarify, as the maker of the current motion, the motion to amend that's on the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9182)|
| 2:33:10| my intent in that motion is to go back to what Councilman Roddy suggested earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| is to ask, make that a part of the request to MPC included in this language that essentially says develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9195)|
| 2:33:24| and implement an EMC amortization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| She said she talked about lumping that together, and so that was my intent to clarify that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9206)|
| 2:33:32| If the maker or the seconder is okay with that, that was really my intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| is to not just exclude it totally but to ask MPC, as Councilman Roddy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| to include that in their considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| Okay, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| This is either for Mr. Seymour or Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| How many total acres comprise Turkey Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| It's over 300, 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| Yeah, in the city of Knoxville, part of it's in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| The city of Knoxville would be about 75 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| So over 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9257)|
| 2:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9258)|
| 2:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9259)|
| 2:34:20| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| I wanted to address Mr. Becker's concern that we were prolonging the discussion of a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9261)|
| 2:34:28| when there was not actual support for it among some members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| And I will reiterate my concern that it feels like a digital billboard, which we've already banned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9273)|
| 2:34:41| and it feels like an exemption for a certain entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| The only reason why I started talking about keeping this alive by referring it back to MPC with the consideration language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9286)|
| 2:34:55| was if there was a way we could massage this to make it available to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| And now that does not cancel my concern that it still feels like a digital billboard in terms of its massive size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| but it addresses 50 percent of my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| which is that this feels like an exemption or a consideration for one management area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9310)|
| 2:35:17| And I just can't do that unless I can realistically feel like this would be available to another group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| And that's where I said to Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| there are so many unanswered questions to me as to how you put together a master signage development area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| outside of what's already assembled at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| We are ready to vote on the third amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| We'll go back and do a roll call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Hold on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Let's repeat what this third amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| Mr. Hawkins, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| He grabbed his mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| I love when he grabs his mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| Go ahead, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| He's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| The third amendment is to delete the language that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| One EMC may be permitted as a development directory sign within an area covered by a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9362)|
| 2:36:11| And to include that in the language or include it in the request to MPC to develop an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9371)|
| 2:36:20| Is that a part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| That's what I said a minute ago about a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| That is added to this already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| Let's say that again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| We're not just deleting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| We're lumping it in with the request to MPC to consider and develop an amortization plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9395)|
| 2:36:44| We're also asking them to look at the master signage plan concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| Is that the way you stated earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| But that's not the motion that you ñ I don't believe that's the motion that was made in Mr. Frost's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| Well, that's why I said that for clarification a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| And I asked him if he's okay with that as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| If not, I'm not going to press it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| Is that or is that not a friendly amendment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| Are you okay with that, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| Would you rather keep it clean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| Just go with the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| We're going to go to roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| You want me to do it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| I'm going to delete the language that says one EMC may be permitted as a development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9441)|
| 2:37:28| within an area covered by a master signage plan, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9454)|
| 2:37:35| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9460)|
| 2:37:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| We're going to go to roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9472)|
| 2:37:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| I heard five nos and four yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| So that amendment fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| I'm not going to make another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| Right now then we're going to go back to the motion as doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9486)|
| 2:38:12| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| Joe, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| I think we do need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| And we need to do two things with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| And I've actually I think I've got some language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| And I don't know if this needs to be two motions or one, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| One, we need to put an acreage thing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| I think that is probably something for at least now we need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| I'm actually not going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| That's somebody else's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| What I want to do is amend, add the language that is in option A, page 1F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| which would be sort of below this section, and I'll just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| A development directory sign approved as part of a master signage plan may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| incorporate one electronic message center as an integrated part of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| business ground or monument sign and shall have a minimum matrix area of 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| square feet and a maximum matrix area of one-third of the total sign area or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| 100 square feet, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Such signs shall be identified on and constructed in accordance with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| approved master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9560)|
| 2:39:27| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9570)|
| 2:39:31| Before you have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| Does anybody want to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9573)|
| 2:39:34| A little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| Going once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| Don't get rid of it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| Well, somebody's going to need to second it before we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| I may be just completely brain dead, but I don't think that addresses what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| the Turkey Creek partners are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| They're asking for something that's 420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9595)|
| 2:39:56| And this is much smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9597)|
| 2:39:58| So you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| Yes, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| That was the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| So this amendment allows for a master sign plan that is up to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| This is the MPC staff recommendation for how a master sign plan should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| This is not the Turkey Creek amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| But your amendment does not address the size of the parcel that is utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| a master sign plan agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| You're getting into the 25,000 square feet, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| I'm trying to answer the Turkey Creek question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| Turkey Creek doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| I did not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| You rascal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Stay on topic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| Now you say stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| I'm trying to keep him from making fun of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| Yes, that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| No, I don't want the 420 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| My sense is MPC staff said within a master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| an MPC actually did not put that 100-acre requirement in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| And it's potentially a loophole and potentially we weren't going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| But it feels like it's an answer to their question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| It's an answer to Mr. Bidwell's request, and the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| And I would like to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| So that's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| And I'm probably really stupid for even bringing it up because I didn't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| Can I withdraw my second now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| Yes, you can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| Is that serious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| Anybody else like to second Mr. Becker's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| Seeing that, the motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| Now we're back to the motion as doubly amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| Mr. Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| I'd like to amend the motion to add language that's on page three of our handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| under recommendation from the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| which states the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommends approval of the proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9711)|
| 2:41:56| that's modified to permit a, and instead of for 2,400 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9716)|
| 2:42:01| it's a measure for developments of 100 acres or more with a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9721)|
| 2:42:09| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| I think we should, those acres I want to lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| but I don't want to just arbitrarily do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| We've talked a lot about this 100-acre issue, so I'll leave that as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| Could you repeat that, please, for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| I think I understand it, Vice Mayor, but I'd just like for you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| That would say 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9754)|
| 2:42:35| 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090113?start=9756)|
