| 0:01:10| Thank you. Nine out of 11. We do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=70.0)|
| 0:01:13| If everyone will stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=73.0)|
| 0:01:16| Director Boock, if you'd lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=76.0)|
| 0:01:24| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=84.0)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=106.0)|
| 0:01:48| Why we are here today. The purpose of this meeting is to hear proof and arguments regarding what sanctions, if any, are to be placed on the beer license of the beer holder of the business known as El Tequila Bar and Grill, located at 7002 Maynardville Pike, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=108.0)|
| 0:02:12| Under Section 4-8H of the Knox County Beer Ordinance, the beer board may revoke, suspend, or impose a civil penalty that for any violation of or provision of the chapter, or whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that premises of any person, firm, or corporation holding a permit under the beer board permit are being maintained by the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=132.0)|
| 0:02:41| and operated in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=161.0)|
| 0:02:50| And in just a moment, I'll turn this meeting over to Director Booth, but to make sure everyone has the handouts, in addition to the agenda that was given to us, everyone should have a packet, the first page being Sheriff's, Knox County Sheriff's Department, and then the second one begins Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=170.0)|
| 0:03:13| And this is actually the history of everything the beer board has done since we first met them for the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=193.0)|
| 0:03:21| So if everyone has those papers, Director Booth, I'll turn this over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=201.0)|
| 0:03:27| Everyone who is going to testify before this beer board, please stand, raise your right hand to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=207.0)|
| 0:03:33| You and each of you swear to give testimony today before this beer board will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=213.0)|
| 0:03:43| Okay, you may be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=223.0)|
| 0:03:46| I'm going to describe for you the way this hearing is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=226.0)|
| 0:03:49| It's going to be somewhat like a courtroom hearing, although this is not a court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:55| It's a due process hearing to which the business owner is given all rights under due process to have his case heard, as well as the beer board in Knox County is equally entitled to put forth its case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=235.0)|
| 0:04:09| So here is the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=249.0)|
| 0:04:11| We've already had a statement of the case from the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=251.0)|
| 0:04:14| She said what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=254.0)|
| 0:04:17| We'll start off with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=257.0)|
| 0:04:19| Lieutenant Walker will get up and testify as to the record of violations and complaints against the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=259.0)|
| 0:04:27| He already has submitted to the board, and it's off record now, and also a copy to the attorney for El Tequila the documents, the citations, and his summary, which he's going to testify to by voice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=267.0)|
| 0:04:44| After he has done that, any one of the members of this board can ask Lieutenant Walker any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=284.0)|
| 0:04:51| You, the board, are serving as a quasi-judicial function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=291.0)|
| 0:04:55| You make the decision, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=295.0)|
| 0:04:57| I don't advise you on what to say or do or not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=297.0)|
| 0:05:00| You're the judge and the jury, so you get to ask the questions of everybody who's going to be a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=300.0)|
| 0:05:06| After that, the attorney for El Tequila is going to have his shot at Lieutenant Walker, and he can ask Lieutenant Walker whatever questions he wants on cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=306.0)|
| 0:05:16| Then, like in a courtroom, if there's follow-up questions from this board to Lieutenant Walker, they call it rebuttal, serve rebuttal, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=316.0)|
| 0:05:25| We'll go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=325.0)|
| 0:05:26| We will give the business every opportunity to be heard and have their attorney argue whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=326.0)|
| 0:05:32| After that, after the case has been concluded on behalf of Knox County, then the business can call its witnesses, whoever they want, however they want, and start questioning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=332.0)|
| 0:05:43| Once he has questioned, that's Scott, has questioned any of his witnesses, then this board will have the opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses, just like in a courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=343.0)|
| 0:05:55| When all of that has been done, then this beer board will decide, once all the proof is in, can argue, debate, make motion, whatever, and do whatever this beer board thinks is in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=355.0)|
| 0:06:10| So that's the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=370.0)|
| 0:06:12| So we'll start off with Lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=372.0)|
| 0:06:15| If you could take the podium and stand, state your name and your position with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=375.0)|
| 0:06:21| Tom Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=381.0)|
| 0:06:22| I'm a lieutenant with the Knox County Sheriff's Office Environmental Crimes Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=382.0)|
| 0:06:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:26| And have you, through the time period in your report, been in front of the beer board with regard to complaints and allegations and violations by El Tequila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=386.0)|
| 0:06:37| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=397.0)|
| 0:06:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=398.0)|
| 0:06:39| If you would proceed then with what's in the record, and we have given that same record and what you're going to testify from to counsel for El Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=399.0)|
| 0:06:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=408.0)|
| 0:06:50| It was first reported on November 1st of 2022 at approximately 1145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=410.0)|
| 0:06:56| That's 2345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=416.0)|
| 0:06:58| I wrote military time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=418.0)|
| 0:06:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=419.0)|
| 0:07:01| A report, and it gives a report number, documented a large fight where several officers had to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=421.0)|
| 0:07:07| And it basically took most of the night shift to respond to that large riot that they had in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=427.0)|
| 0:07:18| I don't want to just do this at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=438.0)|
| 0:07:22| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=442.0)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you to my employees for recording this as a continuing objection, albeit I have other faith in the Lord and lieutenant Walker's ability to read reports and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=443.0)|
| 0:07:35| I didn't get it on here early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=455.0)|
| 0:07:38| So I just want to put this objection on the record in that this is serving as a quasi-judicial complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=458.0)|
| 0:07:44| That being said, you're making decisions relative to substantive rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=464.0)|
| 0:07:50| And the buzzword that was used there was due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=470.0)|
| 0:07:53| And due process at law requires certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=473.0)|
| 0:07:58| That being said, thus, when we have testimony at this point in time, albeit I again have faith in lieutenant Walker's ability to summarize reports and take this as no disparagement for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=478.0)|
| 0:08:09| He was not the investigating officer relative to these reports and that they would be best served by having the individual officers that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=489.0)|
| 0:08:17| Otherwise, just like in a criminal case or in any type of case in which there is a substantive right deprived, it deprives effectively El Tequilo Council of the ability to confront and or cross-examine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=497.0)|
| 0:08:31| We have certain requirements under the law, and I'll direct a view from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=511.0)|
| 0:08:35| Correct me if I'm wrong relative to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:38| That's why reports, generally reports of law, they're not missing because you cannot basically cross-examine a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=518.0)|
| 0:08:47| And so under that set of circumstances, if we're going to conduct this as a due process hearing, then obviously I would object to the testimony as far as summary form of lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=527.0)|
| 0:08:58| I'm not going to pop up and down each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=538.0)|
| 0:09:00| I would just like it to be recognized as a continuing objection, again, not directed at him personally, but his summary with regards to what are alleged to be complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=540.0)|
| 0:09:13| Your continuing objection is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=553.0)|
| 0:09:15| I would point out that as in most administrative hearings, whether it be here or even the state, the strict rules of hearsay and that are not necessarily followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=555.0)|
| 0:09:25| So your objection is noted as a continuing objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=565.0)|
| 0:09:29| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=569.0)|
| 0:09:30| And likewise, too, when we address this as a quasi-judicial hearing or a quasi-due process hearing relative to it, I'm not sure if you're aware that your own rules don't even provide for the issuance of subpoenas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=570.0)|
| 0:09:44| You understand that as a party that is agreed, unless someone wants to agree to be here, that the agreed party has no ability to subpoena someone, even in civil court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=596.0)|
| 0:09:57| Down the hall or in the building, we have the ability and the right to subpoena witnesses and to compel them to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=597.0)|
| 0:10:05| And that is at the very basis of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:10| So with that also interposed as an objection, we'll get to this again with regards to argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=610.0)|
| 0:10:17| But I think it's something that everybody needs to consider and be aware when looking at the way that your board, not as a membership, but the way it is currently constructed and handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:30| Objection is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=630.0)|
| 0:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=635.0)|
| 0:10:36| So during the report, the number was 2210-010056.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=636.0)|
| 0:10:45| Basically, it documented there was a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=645.0)|
| 0:10:48| Several officers from the night shift had to respond to the scene to break up the fight in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=648.0)|
| 0:10:53| There were three arrests made for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=653.0)|
| 0:10:56| One suspect threatened an employee by stating he was about to pop off and making a gun gesture with his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=656.0)|
| 0:11:03| Later on that night, it was actually the next day after midnight at 103 in the morning, another report was done where four arrests were made for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=663.0)|
| 0:11:17| That left multiple people being arrested that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=677.0)|
| 0:11:22| That was documented in Report 2210-020061.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=682.0)|
| 0:11:27| And then even later on that night at 304 in the morning, documented Report 2210-020069, the owner of El Tequila assaulted the victim Ernesto Jarvez for back wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=687.0)|
| 0:11:41| There was a report about an assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=701.0)|
| 0:11:44| To my knowledge, there were no charges filed on that and there was just a report made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=704.0)|
| 0:11:49| Another report was done, a more detailed report concerning all the events from the night before, 2210-020118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=709.0)|
| 0:11:59| Basically, it documented that there was the same fight, that there were multiple people arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=719.0)|
| 0:12:04| It also documented that there were several small children present inside the bar that were being pushed out, some in strollers at 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=724.0)|
| 0:12:14| The fact that there were small children in the bar that late at night was concerning to the officers enough to where they felt they had to do another report to document the body cam footage that they went back and reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=734.0)|
| 0:12:27| It didn't dawn on them at the time because they were dealing with the fights and making the arrests, but when they went and reviewed their body camera, they saw that there were children being pushed out in strollers and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=747.0)|
| 0:12:36| That's why they did another report to document those facts a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=756.0)|
| 0:12:41| Then, on November 14th at 1127 at night, report 2210-140971 documented the former head of security, a guy named Eric Owens, attempted to come back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:56| Apparently, there had been some negotiations, according to the report, that he had been removed from his position because he was drinking on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=776.0)|
| 0:13:06| He was allowed to come back, but showed up to work that night intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=786.0)|
| 0:13:10| The head of security at the time, Mr. Little, allowed him to stay on the premise and go into the bar and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=790.0)|
| 0:13:18| At that point, Mr. Owens became even more intoxicated and slapped a water bottle out of Mr. Little's hand, at which point Mr. Little had to punch him in the face in self-defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=798.0)|
| 0:13:28| There was a report done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=808.0)|
| 0:13:30| To my knowledge, there were no charges filed on that one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=810.0)|
| 0:13:33| They both declined to press charges at that point, but a documented report was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:37| On 2014, we had two 911 calls come in from El Tequila from a male named Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=817.0)|
| 0:13:47| You'll see it in your 911 printouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=827.0)|
| 0:13:49| There wasn't a report generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=829.0)|
| 0:13:52| He just called 911 twice, saying that there was a male that was assaulting him inside the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=832.0)|
| 0:13:57| A rural metro ambulance did respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=837.0)|
| 0:14:00| He had some cuts to his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=840.0)|
| 0:14:02| He was treated for the injuries to his face on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:05| He was not transported to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=845.0)|
| 0:14:07| After he got treated, he refused to make a report or even to prosecute the case further, but it was a call that our officers had to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=847.0)|
| 0:14:16| On December 19th, I didn't include the report in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=856.0)|
| 0:14:21| I did put the investigating officer's notes in there and the 911 call sheet so that you would know that it actually did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=861.0)|
| 0:14:29| The report number was 22-12-19-14-27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=869.0)|
| 0:14:33| It came in on December 19th at 8 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=873.0)|
| 0:14:38| Basically, it was a mother of a 16-year-old victim that claimed that she had been drinking inside El Tequila, had gotten intoxicated, was then fondled inside the bar by a patron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=878.0)|
| 0:14:51| She went outside to separate herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=891.0)|
| 0:14:55| Apparently, the patron followed her out, coaxed her into a car, and then raped her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=895.0)|
| 0:15:00| She did not report this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=900.0)|
| 0:15:03| She reported it to her brother almost immediately, according to the report in the officer's notes, but did not report it to her mom for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=903.0)|
| 0:15:10| At that point, forensic evidence was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=910.0)|
| 0:15:12| Our detective did go to the bar and request to check the security video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=912.0)|
| 0:15:17| They do have cameras up and video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=917.0)|
| 0:15:19| I was told that there was no video footage that went back that far to the point when the actual rape took place, supposedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=919.0)|
| 0:15:26| Again, no charges were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=926.0)|
| 0:15:30| The only concern I had with that was that the owner of El Tequila said that they were never aware of this during their testimony at one of the hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=930.0)|
| 0:15:37| and the officer's notes would indicate that that is not correct, that they were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=937.0)|
| 0:15:41| They did know that they were asked for video and the reason for the request for the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=941.0)|
| 0:15:47| Whether or not a rape took place, we have no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=947.0)|
| 0:15:51| Whether or not she was actually in the bar, again, we have no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=951.0)|
| 0:15:55| We don't have any video footage, but the fact that the juvenile might have been in the bar drinking in the first place was a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=955.0)|
| 0:16:02| February 21st, after all this, the beer board suspended the El Tequila beer permit for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=962.0)|
| 0:16:09| That was on February 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=969.0)|
| 0:16:11| On February 25th at 1230 at night, 0035, report number 2302251827 documented the arrest of an adult Hispanic male and a Hispanic juvenile male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=971.0)|
| 0:16:27| They were driving doing donuts in the parking lot with other people in the apartment or in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=987.0)|
| 0:16:34| Driving in a reckless manner, they were pulled over by an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=994.0)|
| 0:16:38| Several empty beer cans were found inside the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=998.0)|
| 0:16:41| The adult male said that he had been drinking inside the establishment and that there were several drunk people already inside the bar, still inside the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1001.0)|
| 0:16:50| And this happened four days after their beer permit was suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1010.0)|
| 0:16:53| Again, don't know if he brought it with him or if it was inside the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1013.0)|
| 0:16:58| We have no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1018.0)|
| 0:17:00| I can only report the facts of how they reported the officer made the arrest for driving, driving without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1020.0)|
| 0:17:07| Both of them were cited for driving without a license on Mr. Mayor site and the car was towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1027.0)|
| 0:17:13| April 17th, again, after this hearing before the beer board, their licensed beer permit was suspended for another 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1033.0)|
| 0:17:23| On May the 7th, 2023 at 0252 in the morning, report 2305070448 documented another large fight in the bar that was pushed out into the parking lot by the security staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1043.0)|
| 0:17:38| Darwin and I'll butcher the last name, Valdez retrieved a handgun from his vehicle and shot several rounds up into the air in the middle of a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1058.0)|
| 0:17:51| Again, nobody was hit, nobody was hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1071.0)|
| 0:17:53| He was arrested and charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1073.0)|
| 0:17:55| Mr. Little was actually a witness, actually pointed him out to our responding officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1075.0)|
| 0:18:00| So most of our night shift on that day was also called to the scene to secure it, make sure we didn't have any wounded people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1080.0)|
| 0:18:08| Search the scene, found the gun, and he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1088.0)|
| 0:18:13| And I believe he was prosecuted all the way through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1093.0)|
| 0:18:16| That was the end of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1096.0)|
| 0:18:21| May the 9th, two days later, report 2305090665 documented a simple assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1101.0)|
| 0:18:29| Two females got into a fight inside El Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1109.0)|
| 0:18:32| The victim was later prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1112.0)|
| 0:18:35| The victim refused to prosecute, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1115.0)|
| 0:18:37| The one female refused to prosecute the other one after the police report was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1117.0)|
| 0:18:41| But, again, it took four of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1121.0)|
| 0:18:44| You'll see the 911 call sheet where they actually send two officers and their partners to this bar now just because of the call volume and the violence that we've seen in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1124.0)|
| 0:18:53| So just officer safety, they end up sending multiple officers to every call now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1133.0)|
| 0:18:58| June 20, 23, the beer boards again suspended the beer permit until today's date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1138.0)|
| 0:19:06| June 25, five days later, at 1230 at night, report number 2306251557 documented a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1146.0)|
| 0:19:16| Several individuals suspected of drinking while underage were asked to leave by security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1156.0)|
| 0:19:22| Suspects refused to leave and demanded to have their cover charge back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1162.0)|
| 0:19:26| This resulted in police being called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1166.0)|
| 0:19:28| Again, we sent multiple officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1168.0)|
| 0:19:30| The suspects end up leaving without an incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1170.0)|
| 0:19:34| There was no arrest made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1174.0)|
| 0:19:36| But once the police got there, they did calm down and actually leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1176.0)|
| 0:19:39| So the report was then documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1179.0)|
| 0:19:43| July 9, 2023, at 107 in the morning, report number 2307090530 documented another disturbance at El Tequila where four very intoxicated suspects refused to leave the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1183.0)|
| 0:19:57| Security called the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1197.0)|
| 0:20:00| We arrived, again, multiple officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1200.0)|
| 0:20:03| The suspects had left prior to the officers actually arriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1203.0)|
| 0:20:07| I talked to the officers personally that were responding that night, and they said they had a high call volume and they were delayed in getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1207.0)|
| 0:20:14| So there was a delay between security calling and our officers getting there that the suspects left before our officers got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1214.0)|
| 0:20:20| But they did a report documenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1220.0)|
| 0:20:24| In the roughly 16 months that El Tequila has been open, they've had 20 complaints for loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1224.0)|
| 0:20:30| Again, I attached the 911 call sheets showing all 20 of the complaints of loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1230.0)|
| 0:20:36| There have been 12 criminal complaints where reports were done, two safety complaints, overcrowding, seven fire alarms that have all come into the 911 center since April of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1236.0)|
| 0:20:49| Again, I've added all those call sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1249.0)|
| 0:20:53| The part where we're concerned about their liquor license and beer license is that they, according to the state ABC board, and I attached the liquor by their drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1253.0)|
| 0:21:06| I don't think he's interpreting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1266.0)|
| 0:21:28| I think he's just reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1288.0)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1289.0)|
| 0:21:31| It doesn't work for the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1291.0)|
| 0:21:33| And so that being said, it's a layperson basically interpreting the law relative to what he's mistaken with regards to licensing establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1293.0)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1303.0)|
| 0:21:44| Objections noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1304.0)|
| 0:21:45| I don't think he's interpreting, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1305.0)|
| 0:21:47| I've submitted evidentiary pictures that are taken from their surveillance footage that they put on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1307.0)|
| 0:21:56| The ABC board says that they have a beer permit that's under a license for restaurants, and part of that is that they have to be open three consecutive days or three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1316.0)|
| 0:22:07| By their own website, they're only open two days a week for limited hours from 10 at night until 3 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1327.0)|
| 0:22:14| And then the other one says 10 at night till 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1334.0)|
| 0:22:18| Every picture that I was able to pull off their website shows the tables that were set up to try and abide by the law that you have to have tables and seating for 40 people or more in a separate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1338.0)|
| 0:22:32| Every one of the pictures shows people sitting at the tables during the night with absolutely no food, and it's multiple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1352.0)|
| 0:22:40| There's no visible food being served during the time of operation, which would limit my belief that they are actually receiving 50 percent of their income due to food, which is a requirement for their liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1360.0)|
| 0:22:52| The reason I kind of documented that, investigated that a little bit, was to show that my belief is that they're not operating legally for a beer permit, much less an ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1372.0)|
| 0:23:09| Can you tell me, is it typical for two cars to go out on a call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1389.0)|
| 0:23:24| I mean, I know a couple of these nights you said it was all the night shift, but is it typical when they go out, they're going to have two cars that go out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1404.0)|
| 0:23:33| It depends on the type of call. Like a domestic, it demands two cars. At least two officers will respond on a domestic. Any call that's in progress, burglary, robbery, any call of violence, two officers will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1413.0)|
| 0:23:48| Loud music, it's usually one officer going to tell them, hey, turn it down. But because of the ongoing issues, the officer safety mandate, because of the violence that we've seen at this place, that we will send two or more, depending on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1428.0)|
| 0:24:04| So we're taking two or more officers off the street for emergencies from November 1st, 2022 to July 9th, 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1444.0)|
| 0:24:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1457.0)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1458.0)|
| 0:24:23| Mr. Spoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1463.0)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1465.0)|
| 0:24:29| The November 1st, 2022 situation and the May 7th of 2023, in both incidents, did all of the night shift employees with the Knox County Sheriff's Department descend on that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:49| If they weren't on a priority one call, which is a call of violence, then yes, they called in the entire shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1489.0)|
| 0:24:55| Okay, so both incidents are fairly similar in circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1495.0)|
| 0:24:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1499.0)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1500.0)|
| 0:25:01| And I believe regarding Tennessee alcohol beverage control at a previous beer board meeting, we were informed that they were not meeting their percentage of food sales to liquor sales and that they had been fined $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1501.0)|
| 0:25:22| I think they were fined because of the fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1522.0)|
| 0:25:25| I don't think it was in violation of the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1525.0)|
| 0:25:27| That hadn't been investigated at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1527.0)|
| 0:25:29| That's what spurred me to kind of dig into that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1529.0)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1533.0)|
| 0:25:34| But I believe that they were cited for running an establishment that had ongoing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1534.0)|
| 0:25:39| I think something along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1539.0)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1541.0)|
| 0:25:42| But it was not the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1542.0)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1543.0)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1544.0)|
| 0:25:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1545.0)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1552.0)|
| 0:26:00| I do have one question regarding the June 25th incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1560.0)|
| 0:26:03| It says that individuals suspected of drinking while underage were asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1563.0)|
| 0:26:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1568.0)|
| 0:26:09| And that the suspects left after several officers showed up without incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1569.0)|
| 0:26:14| Did those officers, in fact, ask them for their I.D.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1574.0)|
| 0:26:18| There was a language barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1578.0)|
| 0:26:19| And none of them said they had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1579.0)|
| 0:26:21| The officers couldn't prove one way or the other at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1581.0)|
| 0:26:24| So, we don't know if they were, in fact, underage or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1584.0)|
| 0:26:26| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1586.0)|
| 0:26:27| The way the call came in from the head of security of El Tequila was he said that they were underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1587.0)|
| 0:26:33| And that's why the officers responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1593.0)|
| 0:26:35| He suspected they were underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1595.0)|
| 0:26:37| That's why they were being asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1597.0)|
| 0:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1600.0)|
| 0:26:42| Ms. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1602.0)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1606.0)|
| 0:26:48| Lieutenant Walker, on November 2nd, 2022, the report documented that small children were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1608.0)|
| 0:26:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1616.0)|
| 0:26:57| Is that indicating that the officers saw the children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1617.0)|
| 0:27:01| Or where does that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:03| It came off their body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1623.0)|
| 0:27:04| I do have the video available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1624.0)|
| 0:27:06| So, you saw that on the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1626.0)|
| 0:27:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1627.0)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1628.0)|
| 0:27:09| And on December 19, 2022, on the rape charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1629.0)|
| 0:27:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1637.0)|
| 0:27:18| That was a possible rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1638.0)|
| 0:27:21| There was no charges that were filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1641.0)|
| 0:27:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1643.0)|
| 0:27:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1644.0)|
| 0:27:25| We lost all forensic evidence when she didn't report it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:28| And there was no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1648.0)|
| 0:27:29| We had no video, no witnesses, no forensic evidence at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1649.0)|
| 0:27:33| So, the case was basically investigated and enclosed for lack of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1653.0)|
| 0:27:38| And then on November 14, 2022, were the victim required an ambulance, but he refused a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1658.0)|
| 0:27:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1666.0)|
| 0:27:47| So, there was no charges filed on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1667.0)|
| 0:27:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1668.0)|
| 0:27:49| If we don't have a victim, we can't file charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1669.0)|
| 0:27:51| And on May 9, 2023, the assault, about two females, there were no charges filed on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1671.0)|
| 0:28:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1681.0)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1682.0)|
| 0:28:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1684.0)|
| 0:28:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1686.0)|
| 0:28:10| So, there would not be charges filed because why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1690.0)|
| 0:28:16| The victim didn't want to prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1696.0)|
| 0:28:18| The officers do a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1698.0)|
| 0:28:19| So, if there's no victim, then there's no charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1699.0)|
| 0:28:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1701.0)|
| 0:28:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1702.0)|
| 0:28:23| We cannot force people to file charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1703.0)|
| 0:28:25| If they want a report so they can think about it and maybe charge later, we're required to do a police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1705.0)|
| 0:28:31| And then if they want to press charges immediately, then we will make the arrest and transport the suspect to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1711.0)|
| 0:28:37| But if they say, I want to think about it, you know, I'll call a detective later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1717.0)|
| 0:28:42| We give them a case card with the police report number, the police report is filed, and they have up to 11 months, 29 days to file their charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1722.0)|
| 0:28:50| Not a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1730.0)|
| 0:28:51| They have a little longer during the felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1731.0)|
| 0:28:53| So, when a police report is made, that is, in fact, a legal document that becomes a part of the permanent record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1733.0)|
| 0:29:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1741.0)|
| 0:29:02| It's always in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1742.0)|
| 0:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1743.0)|
| 0:29:04| It is a reported crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1744.0)|
| 0:29:05| It's whether or not it's prosecuted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1745.0)|
| 0:29:11| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1751.0)|
| 0:29:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1755.0)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1756.0)|
| 0:29:19| Lieutenant Walker, I'm trying to go through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1759.0)|
| 0:29:22| Have any of these calls to 9-1 generated by El Tequila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1762.0)|
| 0:29:28| Several of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1768.0)|
| 0:29:29| The security called about the fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1769.0)|
| 0:29:31| They actually reported most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1771.0)|
| 0:29:33| And so they know since they generated the E-9-1 calls, there's no doubt there were fights there because they called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1773.0)|
| 0:29:42| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1782.0)|
| 0:29:43| Even if nobody was prosecuted or arrested or whatever, it was still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1783.0)|
| 0:29:48| 9-1-1 documents who the caller is and where they're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1788.0)|
| 0:29:52| So, several of the fights that were reported that the fighter was in the parking lot were called in by the security of El Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1792.0)|
| 0:30:01| And in one case, he did point out the suspect was shot into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1801.0)|
| 0:30:05| So, they are the ones generating the reports by reporting the incidents inside the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1805.0)|
| 0:30:15| I guess it might be an AG question or whatever, but to me, this is a nuisance business that should be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1815.0)|
| 0:30:25| That's not for me to decide or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1825.0)|
| 0:30:28| That would be for the AG to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1828.0)|
| 0:30:30| We're just here for one issue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1830.0)|
| 0:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1831.0)|
| 0:30:34| How many establishments can you remember that you've had this type of situation here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1834.0)|
| 0:30:44| With these type of violent incidents, this is the only one I've had to deal with in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1844.0)|
| 0:30:51| Hatmaker's Bar, we helped investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1851.0)|
| 0:30:54| That was a partner one with KPD, and that was just because it was gang-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1854.0)|
| 0:30:58| And we had the gang files on most of the suspects on that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1858.0)|
| 0:31:02| I've had one other bar that's out in the Carnes area called Smash Mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1862.0)|
| 0:31:07| It's just loud music calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1867.0)|
| 0:31:10| It's an ongoing loud music complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1870.0)|
| 0:31:14| Basically, in parking issues, we put up signs, got that parking issue mostly covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1874.0)|
| 0:31:20| and I went out a couple of times with a sound meter and cited the owner a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1880.0)|
| 0:31:24| He actually went out and bought his own sound meter, and I actually went and showed him how to work it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1884.0)|
| 0:31:28| so he could work his own sound monitoring system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1888.0)|
| 0:31:31| I haven't had a call back since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1891.0)|
| 0:31:34| No fights, no anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1894.0)|
| 0:31:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1896.0)|
| 0:31:37| It's mostly loud music, and in the one case, it was a partnership with KPD's investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1897.0)|
| 0:31:43| How long have you been in your profession?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1903.0)|
| 0:31:45| 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1905.0)|
| 0:31:46| In 29 years, this is the only one that really has got to the situation to where—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1906.0)|
| 0:31:51| It is the only one I've worked, yes, that you've worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1911.0)|
| 0:31:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1914.0)|
| 0:31:57| The statement was made, and I just want to—I'll confirm it later if I need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1917.0)|
| 0:32:01| but it seems like if there's a fight inside the bar, the policy is to push them out the door, get them in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1921.0)|
| 0:32:10| That's where we find everybody when we get there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1930.0)|
| 0:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1933.0)|
| 0:32:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1934.0)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1935.0)|
| 0:32:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1938.0)|
| 0:32:20| Sir, I don't know if this may be a question for you, the law department, or for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1940.0)|
| 0:32:24| Can you help us understand the difference between an establishment that is restaurant and drink and entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1944.0)|
| 0:32:32| versus just purely like a music venue that also may serve drinks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1952.0)|
| 0:32:38| I'm going to leave that to a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1958.0)|
| 0:32:41| That's a legal question that I don't think I'm qualified to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1961.0)|
| 0:32:47| Are there different licenses or different operational guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1967.0)|
| 0:32:51| Well, the main guideline for being in a restaurant—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1971.0)|
| 0:32:57| I mean, we've got restaurants that sell on the premises, off premises, or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1977.0)|
| 0:33:05| and that's when you issue a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1985.0)|
| 0:33:07| It's based on one of those applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1987.0)|
| 0:33:09| And if it's on premises, they've got to meet the requirements of a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1989.0)|
| 0:33:14| which used to be done by the Health Department, now done by the Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1994.0)|
| 0:33:18| So you're well acquainted with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=1998.0)|
| 0:33:20| So those are the three kinds of permits and establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2000.0)|
| 0:33:24| The one that's been referred to here is the state liquor license requires more stringent type of restaurant requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2004.0)|
| 0:33:36| than do you as far as issuing a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2016.0)|
| 0:33:39| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2019.0)|
| 0:33:41| Yeah, I'm just trying to better understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2021.0)|
| 0:33:43| I mean, every visual I can see from El Tequila from all their social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2023.0)|
| 0:33:48| it looks like a performance venue and dance hall that serves alcohol that is like an event venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2028.0)|
| 0:33:56| like Mill & Mine would have a concert and they would sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2036.0)|
| 0:34:00| Well, the state law and your beer permit law says that if you're going to serve food at your restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2040.0)|
| 0:34:08| you can stay open until 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2048.0)|
| 0:34:10| That's both under the state law and it's under your beer permit law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2050.0)|
| 0:34:16| If they're a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2056.0)|
| 0:34:23| Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2063.0)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2065.0)|
| 0:34:26| I had a follow up question, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2066.0)|
| 0:34:29| You said you've been with the sheriff department 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2069.0)|

| 0:34:36| I was 10 years with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2076.0)|
| 0:34:37| OK, and how long have you been in this division of working with the beer permit violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2077.0)|
| 0:34:43| I was assigned to the environmental crimes unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2083.0)|
| 0:34:45| I actually started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2085.0)|
| 0:34:47| It was a brand new unit that started right at November of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2087.0)|
| 0:34:52| OK, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2092.0)|

| 0:34:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2098.0)|
| 0:34:59| And so you've been in this department two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2099.0)|
| 0:35:02| How many cases of beer violations have you worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2102.0)|
| 0:35:06| Beer violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2106.0)|
| 0:35:08| This is my first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2108.0)|
| 0:35:09| I don't work with the beer board with the that's Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2109.0)|
| 0:35:15| So this is your first one you that you're testifying about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2115.0)|
| 0:35:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2118.0)|
| 0:35:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2119.0)|
| 0:35:20| And another question on the in regards to whether or not they're serving food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2120.0)|
| 0:35:26| That is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2126.0)|
| 0:35:28| Do you have any proof to that they're only serving 50 percent of their revenue is for meals or is that just your summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2128.0)|
| 0:35:38| I'm sorry, ma'am. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2138.0)|

| 0:35:47| and that they do not make 50 percent of their gross revenue from serving meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2147.0)|
| 0:35:51| Do you have any proof to that or is that your speculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2151.0)|
| 0:35:55| Well, ma'am, I apply common sense that the limited hours and they're only open two nights a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2155.0)|
| 0:36:00| If you're you can't serve that much food in a take an order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:04| serve it and you prepare it and serve it in five hours in order to make 50 percent of your gross income from from all the liquor sales and beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2164.0)|
| 0:36:15| You know what their gross income was during that time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:18| No, ma'am. But there's no food being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2178.0)|
| 0:36:20| There's nothing on the tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:22| And you're basing that upon the video or the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:25| Yeah, there are pictures from their Web site. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2185.0)|

| 0:36:44| Selling to minors of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2204.0)|
| 0:36:47| That is correct. We don't have an underage Hispanic male or female in our employee or even associated with us that we could send in undercover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2207.0)|

| 0:37:25| But to your knowledge, there has been no report of underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2245.0)|
| 0:37:29| No, no. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2249.0)|

| 0:37:38| Can you go through the experience of what you have as far as your titles as bomb gang?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2258.0)|
| 0:37:45| You're not only experiencing it. You say you're the you are the environmental officer, but you're more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2265.0)|
| 0:37:51| You're more than that. So just for the record, your experience can can show in this investigation about the other things that you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2271.0)|
| 0:38:01| I served 10 years as a task force officer with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, where I investigated domestic and international terrorism cases at the federal level and international level for any weapons of mass destruction cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2281.0)|
| 0:38:16| I've been the primary gang investigator for the Knox County Sheriff's Office for the last 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2296.0)|
| 0:38:21| I've testified as an expert witness as a gang identification expert in 62 trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2301.0)|
| 0:38:28| I've also testified as a bomb disposal expert on two occasions, a fatal accident investigator on two occasions and a narcotics investigator expert on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2308.0)|

| 0:38:59| I've done fraud and forgery investigations. I was assigned to the fraud and forgery unit for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2339.0)|
| 0:39:05| I was also assigned to the PREA unit, which is the prison rape eradication unit out at our jail for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2345.0)|
| 0:39:12| So I'm pretty much a fatal accident investigator, but I've done every kind of investigation federally, internationally and locally that you could possibly do in 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2352.0)|
| 0:39:35| I feel like what I'm hearing from you is that it doesn't matter whether they have a beer license or not, people are still going in there and getting fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2375.0)|
| 0:39:50| That's what the reports indicate. Yes, ma'am. Again, it's an opinion based on reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:55| I understand. Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2395.0)|
| 0:40:00| Now, one other thing, technicality was in a Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2400.0)|
| 0:40:04| These reports that you have submitted to the board and copies to counsel for El Tequila, they created in the ordinary course and scope of the business of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2404.0)|

| 0:40:33| Mr. Walker, let me ask you a couple of things and let's just start chronologically and probably with the most important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2433.0)|
| 0:40:40| You've never personally been in the El Tequila bar and grill, have you? Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2440.0)|
| 0:40:43| OK. When did you go in there? I went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2443.0)|
| 0:40:47| Now, see, back in. Well, the night of the shooting, I was actually in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:53| OK. The one back in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2453.0)|
| 0:41:03| The shooting was May 7th. Yeah, the May 7th when I was there, the February one where the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:16| They were doing the burnouts. I was just having to be out on patrol that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2476.0)|
| 0:41:19| So I went over and watched the officers do their thing on that. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2479.0)|
| 0:41:23| And that didn't involve you physically being in El Tequila on that occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2483.0)|
| 0:41:27| I'm sorry. With the burnouts. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2487.0)|
| 0:41:29| Did that involve you physically being in El Tequila or just on the premises of the parking lot that is situated outside of El Tequila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2489.0)|
| 0:41:35| OK. I've been in I've been actually inside the building three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2495.0)|
| 0:41:38| OK. So you've been physically inside the building. But what you've related with regards to these photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:43| that's just merely your assumptions that you have basically testified here, too, with regards to the selling of food now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:50| Correct. Yes. OK. So relative to physically being in the building and seeing the bar operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2510.0)|
| 0:41:57| were you in there during a period of time this bar and grill was being operated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2517.0)|
| 0:42:01| Just the I've seen the pictures on their own Internet. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2521.0)|
| 0:42:04| But what I'm saying is like during a night, as what you've indicated with regards to what I believe you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:10| 16 reports are over a 16 month period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2530.0)|
| 0:42:14| Have you ever personally gone into El Tequila during one of these nights when this stuff is allegedly going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2534.0)|
| 0:42:21| No. OK. In relative to the reports, let's sort of start taking them sort of one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2541.0)|
| 0:42:27| You reference the report November 1st, 2022, bold at twenty three forty five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:32| And we'll all agree that's eleven forty five p.m., correct? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:35| OK. And then down below that, you have a number of reports I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:42| You have a summary sheet and then you have reports that are listed sort of in descending order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2562.0)|
| 0:42:47| And then the last document that you provided was the rules of the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2567.0)|
| 0:42:53| Yes. OK. And so if we look at that, you indicate that November 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2573.0)|
| 0:43:00| Now, correct me if I am wrong. Will you look at the report that is the top report and is the report date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2580.0)|
| 0:43:07| Would it be what what is the significance of the report date being October 2nd, 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2587.0)|
| 0:43:14| And the actual summary having it is November 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2594.0)|
| 0:43:19| You see where I'm talking about the report date at the top of the incident report, the ten one and then the ten two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2599.0)|
| 0:43:26| Yes, sir. That's just I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2606.0)|
| 0:43:29| The officer made the report as a report number. The dispatch gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2609.0)|
| 0:43:33| Right. Well, what I'm what I'm getting to is this top report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2613.0)|
| 0:43:37| I'm looking at the number twenty two one zero zero one zero zero five six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:43| Is that the number that corresponds to the November 1st report? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2623.0)|
| 0:43:47| OK. But the report dates October 2nd, 2022, is it not? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2627.0)|
| 0:43:52| Yes. OK. So relative to this, would the summary be correct or would the report be the more accurate document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2632.0)|
| 0:44:00| Well, with the incident happening at eleven forty five, the time clock clicks over at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2640.0)|
| 0:44:05| So that 50 minute time period, the officer, the 911 call came in on one day and the officer actually did a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2645.0)|
| 0:44:11| Once he got there, figured out what's going on after the midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2651.0)|
| 0:44:13| But October 2nd, that would have been flipped over. Twenty nine days. November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2653.0)|
| 0:44:19| I mean, does it not say October 2nd, 2022? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2659.0)|
| 0:44:24| Ten zero one is November 1st and ten zero two is November 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2664.0)|
| 0:44:28| OK. Ten zero is. I mean, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2668.0)|
| 0:44:34| I'm not. I don't. Is it like in the way we count months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2674.0)|
| 0:44:38| Yes. January is one February. That was probably my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2678.0)|
| 0:44:42| Yeah. OK. So it's October 2nd is what we're talking about. We're not talking about November. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2682.0)|
| 0:44:47| Yeah. Let's look at this document a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2687.0)|
| 0:44:50| We've got information pertaining to who's involved relative to it in this first document ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:57| And I'm just going to use the last numbers five, six, which we now agree is on October 2nd of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2697.0)|
| 0:45:02| Yeah. Right. Yes. You'll flip to the summary page relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2702.0)|
| 0:45:11| Do you have any indication relative to who called law enforcement there relative to the incident that occurred relative to the threats made to El Tequila personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2711.0)|
| 0:45:26| No, the report just says that they were officers were dispatched to seven zero zero two Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2726.0)|
| 0:45:32| Right. Reference to a disturbance. Right. So that very well. You don't have any knowledge that could have just as well have been El Tequila personnel calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2732.0)|
| 0:45:39| saying, hey, law enforcement tasked with protecting us. Come out here. Do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2739.0)|
| 0:45:44| We don't know. The number one sheet would say, OK, but that's not part of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2744.0)|
| 0:45:50| It's not part of the police report. No, that's why I added the 911 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2750.0)|
| 0:45:53| OK, so we've got the 911 calls and we should be looking for October 2nd, 2022 when we're examining those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2753.0)|
| 0:46:00| October one. Well, the report that flips over to October 2nd. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2760.0)|
| 0:46:06| Right. That's when the officer did the report. OK. 911 call. So we should look at October 1st relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2766.0)|
| 0:46:12| Great. All right. Now, look with me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2772.0)|
| 0:46:17| You've got a another report here on November 2nd, 2022 at 0103, one o'clock in the morning, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2777.0)|
| 0:46:27| and documents another arrest for public intoxication and resisting arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2787.0)|
| 0:46:33| And at the back of that, there's a summary relative to that. Correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2793.0)|
| 0:46:37| OK. And concerning where these individuals are standing, they're standing in the middle of a parking lot. Correct. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2797.0)|
| 0:46:46| OK. So they're not physically in El Tequila. Right. No. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2806.0)|
| 0:46:50| And you personally don't know where they came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2810.0)|
| 0:46:53| You just know that basically they got arrested in the parking lot of El Tequila. Correct. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2813.0)|
| 0:47:01| And that's the report that ends in six one that you've referenced. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2821.0)|
| 0:47:08| Again, November 2nd, 2022 at three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2828.0)|
| 0:47:15| Will you look at the report that corresponds to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2835.0)|
| 0:47:19| And would you agree with me that it shows the date of October 22nd? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2839.0)|
| 0:47:25| OK. So if we were to look at these reports and we can look at them sequentially in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:33| at least from the way that it's written on the sheet, it would appear to a layperson just looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:39| If they don't go look at the actual reports that all of these incidents occurred basically in just a few hour period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2859.0)|
| 0:47:45| But that's not what the actual reports say, is it? Because remember, October 2nd, October 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:52| You'll agree with me that's at least 20 days. It is. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2872.0)|
| 0:47:55| The officer went on vacation and failed to do the report. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2875.0)|
| 0:47:58| So the officer went on vacation, failed to do the report. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2878.0)|
| 0:48:02| So that being said, not only are you reporting that about an officer's information that he's put in this document that you're not personally aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2882.0)|
| 0:48:11| you're just basically summarizing a report that an officer does 20 days late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2891.0)|
| 0:48:16| I only testify to what's documented. Right. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2896.0)|
| 0:48:19| And in that particular situation relative to it, that's a Sergeant Daniels in the summary part of that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2899.0)|
| 0:48:29| Correct. OK. And he's flagged down in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2909.0)|
| 0:48:34| And he comes to the parking lot and this is a Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2914.0)|
| 0:48:39| Juarez saying that he confronted the suspect owner relative to backed wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2919.0)|
| 0:48:45| And there was evidently some sort of a dispute. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2925.0)|
| 0:48:48| Yeah. OK. No police, if you will, arrest or anything occurs out of what we're talking about other than just these public intoxications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2928.0)|
| 0:48:58| Correct. With the guys standing in the middle of the parking lot. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2938.0)|
| 0:49:01| And the resisting arrest. Yeah. OK. Well, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2941.0)|
| 0:49:04| But the original auspice is you got drunks in the parking lot. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2944.0)|
| 0:49:08| OK. Would you be surprised that there are drunks in the parking lot down at the UT area on occasion around a ballgame Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2948.0)|
| 0:49:15| Not not a surprise. OK. All right. So that being said, while drunks in a parking lot, they're not that uncommon in Tennessee, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2955.0)|
| 0:49:25| Not not uncommon, but the reason we were sent there in the first place was a reported disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2965.0)|
| 0:49:30| There was a fight. Do you know if there are more bars in the city or in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2970.0)|
| 0:49:34| Probably not. Right. So we would expect, really, if we're looking at numbers to see much more activity with regards to in the actual municipal confines of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2974.0)|
| 0:49:44| as opposed to Knox County. Correct. Correct. OK. And so we're dealing with city type situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2984.0)|
| 0:49:50| This that's not this body that we're dealing with, is it? Or is it you tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2990.0)|
| 0:49:55| I'm not understanding. Well, if we're dealing with stuff that occurs in the city, who do we deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=2995.0)|
| 0:50:00| The city police. OK. But you're reporting what's occurring in the county. Right. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3000.0)|
| 0:50:06| OK. And let's look here, too, at the next report that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3006.0)|
| 0:50:14| OK. That's the report dating ended in one a October 2nd, 2022. Correct. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3014.0)|
| 0:50:23| And relative to this information on it, it actually has some documents at the back of it that aren't on the other documents, particularly the use of force. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3023.0)|
| 0:50:37| Correct. OK. And again, what we're talking here, it reports on October 1st, 2022 and October 2nd, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3037.0)|
| 0:50:48| Makes it look like two days. But what we're doing is it's just where the clock flips up. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3048.0)|
| 0:50:53| So it's really just one incident. One big event. Yes. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3053.0)|
| 0:50:58| And relative to that, there were five arrests made. They were all for public intoxication, disorderly conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:06| Correct. And these people had been ejected from the establishment by the bouncers. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3066.0)|
| 0:51:11| My understanding. Yes. OK. What what are bouncers supposed to do? Are they supposed to let them fight in the bar, hold them down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3071.0)|
| 0:51:17| What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to put them out and call the law enforcement personnel? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3077.0)|
| 0:51:23| OK. So they did what they're supposed to do. OK. So that being said, any report about, oh, the idea to shove them out in the parking lot, that's that's what they're supposed to do to get them out of, if you will, the group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3083.0)|
| 0:51:37| Right. Yes. And relative to the use of force, that's, again, a guy standing in the middle of the parking lot. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3097.0)|
| 0:51:53| Miguel Andres. Yes. All right. So none of these arrests actually occur in the bar, so to speak. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3113.0)|
| 0:52:03| No. And November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3123.0)|
| 0:52:10| Excuse me, October 14th. You've got it reported as November 14th. OK, so we're again in it just so we don't look like we've just got this conflagration of all this stuff happening right at the beginning of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3130.0)|
| 0:52:22| This is actually that November 14th should be October. Right. Correct. And in fact, all of these dates would be appropriately corrected as October. And in fact, some of them are October 22nd. Correct. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3142.0)|
| 0:52:40| Yeah. Just I'm not beating you up on it. Yeah. No, no, no. I get it. I get it. I should have read it closer. I got you. And in that particular case, basically, who called law enforcement to come when a drunk former employee tried to show up to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3160.0)|
| 0:53:02| Mr. Little. Mr. Little. OK. So that being said, this gentleman here. Right. The head of security. So just like if somebody drunk showed up at any other business, you call law enforcement and say, I've got a drunk. I want him to go to jail. That doesn't mean he necessarily you don't know where he got drunk. You just know what he says. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3182.0)|
| 0:53:24| It was Mr. Little's statement, apparently. That's said that he'd gotten drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3204.0)|
| 0:53:34| So the bouncer took whatever actions were necessary. And there was, again, no arrest made other than someone for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3214.0)|
| 0:54:03| Yeah, that's correct. Both of them refused to prosecute at that point. And then if we take a look at the next report, let's just go down the next report, the February 25th, 2023. That's the donuts in the parking lot. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3243.0)|
| 0:54:24| Report ending in two, seven. Yeah. One, eight, two, seven. OK. Yes. And again, just like what you were asked by members of the board relative to the age of these individuals, only thing we've got is just speculation from appearance or anything else that they appear to be underage. And we don't know where they were drinking. We just know that they were doing donuts in the parking lot of El Tequila. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3264.0)|
| 0:54:54| The adult had a driver's license. The suspected juvenile stated that he was 17 or 18. He didn't know, again, language barrier and he had no ID on him. So they were both cited driving without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3294.0)|
| 0:55:12| The adult did say he had been drinking inside the bar and there were a lot of drunk people inside. OK. That's the same adult that got arrested in the parking lot for doing donuts for the juvenile. Right. Correct. OK. So that being said, you certainly wouldn't vouch for his credibility, would you? Don't know him? No, I don't personally. OK. So that being said, you can't speak as to his veracity or his worthiness to be believed under such that that wouldn't even meet the threshold requirement for the issuance of a search warrant because you don't know him, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3312.0)|
| 0:55:42| So. Relative to the incident then in May of 2023, that's the two gals fighting in the or two females, sorry, I shouldn't say gals, two females fighting in the in the bar, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3342.0)|
| 0:56:07| What was the report number on that one? 0665. And again, there's no charges, correct? Yeah. No, the officer responded and did a report. And at that point, the female that had been assaulted refused to press charges. And she was the one that called 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3367.0)|
| 0:56:23| OK. So relative to what we're looking at, at least with regards to these, we've either got El Tequila doing what the bouncer is supposed to do and the employees are supposed to do, calling for law enforcement assistance, or we got, for the most part, people that are intoxicated that we don't know where they got intoxicated in the parking lot. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3383.0)|
| 0:56:46| I have no personal knowledge where they've been drinking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3406.0)|
| 0:57:02| And concerning this most recent, the June 25th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3422.0)|
| 0:57:12| 1557. Yeah. And that's where they called about folks, if they would, sort of in their community caretaker role and said there are some intoxicated people and they're refusing to leave, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3432.0)|
| 0:57:30| Yes. OK. Security called and told the officers that they were refusing to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3450.0)|
| 0:57:38| And then when the officers asked, what's the last sentence? Not the very last about this did occur in Knox County, Tennessee. The officer asked how they were getting alcohol in the bar and security stated they did not go because they didn't go inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3458.0)|
| 0:57:51| So at least from the report, it's unclear whether or not they were ever inside the bar at El Tequila. They were just asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3471.0)|
| 0:58:00| No, the inference is the security didn't go inside. If you read the report, officers ask how were they getting alcohol in the bar and security stated they did not know because they did not go inside as the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3480.0)|
| 0:58:12| They don't go inside. So it's a report by parking lot security. So this is a situation where they've now got not only security inside the club, but they've got people outside the club providing security. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3492.0)|
| 0:58:26| Yes. OK. So it's an additional layer of security. And so when these individuals encountered an intoxicated person, it appears that they did what a good citizen supposed to do and they call law enforcement. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3506.0)|
| 0:58:38| Well, yeah, they called because they're causing a problem. I got it. But I mean, we're not supposed to. We're a civilized society. We're not supposed to take things into our own hand, manhandle somebody, pop them, do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3518.0)|
| 0:58:51| We're supposed to call the police. Right. Correct. OK. And relative to this alleged rape, this May 7th, 2023 alleged rape. Yes. The mom called, not the child. Correct. The child cannot report a felony that has to be done by an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3531.0)|
| 0:59:12| I understand. But from what we're talking about, this is not a report from the child. This is a report for the mother on behalf of the child. Correct. The mom called 9-1-1. The child was interviewed by the sex crimes detective. Right. And interviewed what, some two to three weeks later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3552.0)|
| 0:59:29| My understanding is. OK. So that being said, just from a pure prosecutable standpoint, again, you don't know this child. No. Speaking as the veracity of this child and certainly with regards to whether or not it occurred or didn't occur, there's simply just as much proof that it didn't occur is what she says is it did occur. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3569.0)|
| 0:59:52| That's why I testified that we had zero evidence. The report was made. The officer went and asked El Tequila for the videotape. The only concern I had was when they got up here to testify during the first hearing where their license was going to be suspended, they said they had no idea that it even occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3592.0)|
| 1:00:14| Do you know who the officer spoke with at El Tequila? Said the owner. OK. But that being said, do you know whether or not the officer knew it was the owner or to whom he spoke? Just other than what the officer said, put it on his report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3614.0)|
| 1:00:27| He put it out. He didn't put it in his notes. He put it in the actual record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3627.0)|
| 1:00:58| And I left the report out because it involves a juvenile. I apologize. He did say I believe it was the young lady that was a co-owner. It had a female name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3658.0)|
| 1:01:07| But again, that's what the officer said. Yes. And that being said, did we just take the officer's word simply because he wears a badge and has authority? Or that being said, you've certainly been a law enforcement officer. You've seen officers be mistaken before, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3667.0)|
| 1:01:21| Sure. All right. You've seen officers. Unfortunately, it happens. They misrepresented things before, haven't they? Yeah. Right. Just as likely that a member of the general public did. Correct. I'm sorry. As far as everybody lies, don't they? Sure. At some point. OK. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3681.0)|
| 1:01:38| All right. And again, no charges ever came out. No, no. There was no forensic evidence to bring in charges. And relative to loud music complaints, I mean, that's just something that there's no citations ever been issued to El Tequila relative to loud music. Just reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3698.0)|
| 1:02:00| The reason they can't do citations is you have to have a sound meter. And we just don't have one. We we just recently got one when I got to this national park. OK. Well, since we've done that, with regards to that, have there been any sound violations? No. OK. So we don't have any criminal charges arising out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3720.0)|
| 1:02:17| Relative to these documents that are labeled event search, is this basically what you're talking about with regards to this is a 9-1-1 printout? Yes. 9-1-1 call sheet. OK. So we go through that and we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3737.0)|
| 1:02:42| And if we look at these, we can tell in fairly short order, basically, who is actually made the report. And in this particular case on the lead one up there, it says advised her daughter, of course, blacked out the child's name happened approximately a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3762.0)|
| 1:02:59| And Tequila does not know the subject. Right. She didn't know the subject. OK. And that's what that deals with. Correct. Correct. And the next ones deal with 20 loud music complaints. Correct. OK. And then relative to the 12 criminal complaints, you is this this information that you've inter delineated on these reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3779.0)|
| 1:03:21| And I know Law Director Buick asked you about that with regards to that. That's something you've inter delineated on the reports. That's not written in the normal course and scope. No, that's me. That's that's your thoughts. Correct. Relative to this with regards to the handwriting, particularly where we're talking about the 12 criminal complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3801.0)|
| 1:03:43| And with regards to that now, we've learned about some public intoxication. Correct. Resisting arrest. Correct. And then we learned about the situation where this gentleman, Mr. Little, cooperated completely with law enforcement. And there was a conviction secured against the gentleman that supposedly discharged a firearm in the air in the parking lot. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3823.0)|
| 1:04:04| And that's what you would expect a citizen to do if they call law enforcement is to cooperate, particularly in his position. Absolutely. And again, the next event search. These are fire alarms. Right. Yes. OK. Don't know who pulled them. Don't know what happened. Don't know if there was a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3844.0)|
| 1:04:23| There was no fire. There were false alarms. OK. And relative to the last one here, when just so that I'm reading that, what is what is your writing say there to something complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3863.0)|
| 1:04:39| Safety safety complaints. OK. And relative to that, there's a caller's name on here, Salvador. And then, Ani, this is a complaint about too many people in there. And then the other one, I think the remarks open line of Mexican music playing. Right. Yes. OK. So that being said, these come in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3879.0)|
| 1:05:10| February 27th, 2022, and then July 10th, 2022. So five months apart, give or take four and a half. And the caller was complaining about loud Mexican music. Well, that is overcrowding. OK. But that being said, that's generally handled by the fire marshal, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3910.0)|
| 1:05:33| Well, when it goes 9-1-1, because of the late night, the fire marshal's not working. Police get called. So we handle. Right. And there's no there were no charges made, no citations issued on either of those alleged safety complaints. And we've already talked about the other with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3933.0)|
| 1:05:49| And just so that we're clear, you don't work for ABC, nor have you ever in your infinite experience work for ABC. And you would defer to ABC and by that alcohol beverage commission with regards to the interpretation and enforcement of their own rules and laws. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3949.0)|
| 1:06:06| Right. And particularly with regards to that, you're aware that it's a state ABC. And I'm not talking about now, but at the beginning issues a, if you will, alcohol permit. Correct. Then it's left is just basically a ministerial task for the beer board then to sue a spot. They have to issue the beer. You're aware of that. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3966.0)|
| 1:06:28| And again, relative to the, the stuff that you've attached here concerning the foodstuffs and things of that nature, you don't have any knowledge of that from your own personal experience. No, I've never been in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=3988.0)|
| 1:06:42| And in the 16 months that this has been going on, allegedly with regards to that, there have been courses. You were asked earlier, no underage sales, correct? No. And relative to this, what's been reported as a spate of criminal conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4002.0)|
| 1:07:07| None of it's actually been criminal conduct in which any employee or anybody with regards to L tequila is received a citation or has been charged. No. Because every time we get there, it's in the parking lot. Well, I got it. But what I'm saying is with regards to when we look at the definitions and we're going to have to do that relative to criminal activity, there's nobody in L tequila been charged with anything. No, not criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4027.0)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Walker, Lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4058.0)|
| 1:07:41| That's right. I'm not hung up on title. So that's any rebuttal questions from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4061.0)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you. Just clarification, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4072.0)|
| 1:07:54| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4074.0)|
| 1:07:56| That's what it sounded like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4076.0)|
| 1:07:58| So that I understand and that I interpret. And again, with regards to L tequila, I'm not hung up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4078.0)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you. Just clarification, Mr. Jones. Are you saying that if they have a Tennessee alcohol beverage license, that this board can never refuse them a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4084.0)|
| 1:08:17| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4097.0)|
| 1:08:19| That's what it sounded like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4099.0)|
| 1:08:20| So that I understand and that I interpret. And again, with regards to it, it is my understanding that if the state ABC goes ahead and issues an alcohol permit, I'm talking at an outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4100.0)|
| 1:08:31| If this was a brand new business and they issue an ABC permit, that then the beer permit then goes hand in hand with regards to that, the ability of the board to refuse at that point in time if the state certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4111.0)|
| 1:08:42| Now, that may or may not be correct, but that is my understanding with regards to the actual beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4122.0)|
| 1:08:46| The actual beer permit, albeit with regards to the city of Knoxville code, the actual authority for municipalities and stuff to do that, that's found in Tennessee Code 575108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4126.0)|
| 1:08:58| And there are certain parameters and requirements associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4138.0)|
| 1:09:01| So with regards to this particular situation, what I was merely pointing out is that Lieutenant Walker was asked to interpret ABC rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4141.0)|
| 1:09:10| And we at the last hearing, if you'll recall, we had an individual and those questions would be better posited to an individual with the state ABC as opposed to either Lieutenant Walker or myself or Law Director Bukes interpretation with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4150.0)|
| 1:09:28| I do not hold myself out as an expert with regards to the interpretation of state ABC law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4168.0)|
| 1:09:34| But upon information and belief and experience, I believe that's the circumstance that we find ourselves in with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4174.0)|
| 1:09:43| And it may be better reserved, Mr. Daley, for argument relative to the ability to revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4183.0)|
| 1:09:51| Basically, there has to be a due process determination as far as dealing with a revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4191.0)|
| 1:09:59| At this point in time, there are certain requirements that permanent revocation may only be applied when there have been at least two violations within a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4199.0)|
| 1:10:11| In this particular case, we've had this ongoing thing, but we've had this hearing with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4211.0)|
| 1:10:18| So I don't think you've met the prerequisites to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4218.0)|
| 1:10:21| So that's something we'll argue about, but that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4221.0)|
| 1:10:25| You keep mentioning the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4225.0)|
| 1:10:27| This is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4227.0)|
| 1:10:29| It's nothing to do with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4229.0)|
| 1:10:31| I mentioned it simply because of the fact that they're, in my information and belief, much more facility-serving alcohol than encounter these type situations located within the municipal confines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4231.0)|
| 1:10:43| I get the city is in the county, and theoretically the county could go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4243.0)|
| 1:10:49| But we see situations on a more regular basis dealing with bars located within the city than what we see with regards to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4249.0)|
| 1:11:01| And I think Lieutenant Walker conceded that because you just simply have more bars located in the city than you do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4261.0)|
| 1:11:08| And I'm not talking about general restaurants, the Conners, chop houses, and places of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4268.0)|
| 1:11:13| Whatever kind of rides that line between bar and grill and bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4273.0)|
| 1:11:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4278.0)|
| 1:11:20| El Tequila, in my opinion, is creating a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4280.0)|
| 1:11:24| In that shopping center, you've got Arby's, Papa John's, Nell's Salon, B20 Vape, Hammer's, Ace Hardware, the Corn Laundromat, Dollar General, and Goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4284.0)|
| 1:11:36| None of them are open after midnight for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4296.0)|
| 1:11:39| And the statement was made about shoving the people out of the bar because they were drunk or they were fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4299.0)|
| 1:11:45| They were purchasing the liquor and the beer inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4305.0)|
| 1:11:50| Were they over served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4310.0)|
| 1:11:52| I don't know what the law is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4312.0)|
| 1:11:54| I'm not going to argue with you, Commissioner Daley, with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4314.0)|
| 1:11:56| I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4316.0)|
| 1:11:58| But what you're doing is you're addressing your concerns to me, and I'm not on trial here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4318.0)|
| 1:12:02| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4322.0)|
| 1:12:04| This is to Lieutenant Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4324.0)|
| 1:12:06| Well, I understand, but you're addressing them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4326.0)|
| 1:12:09| The seller, in my opinion, has oversold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4329.0)|
| 1:12:13| That's why they're drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4333.0)|
| 1:12:15| That's why they push them out in the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4335.0)|
| 1:12:17| If El Tequila was not in that parking lot, Lieutenant Walker, this is an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4337.0)|
| 1:12:23| This is my opinion, your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4343.0)|
| 1:12:25| If El Tequila was not in that parking lot, would we have this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4345.0)|
| 1:12:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4348.0)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4350.0)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4351.0)|
| 1:12:33| Lieutenant Walker, if Modelo didn't make beer, would we see people drinking Modelo beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4353.0)|
| 1:12:40| I mean, it's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4360.0)|
| 1:12:42| It's ridiculous by its very definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4362.0)|
| 1:12:44| That being said, you can't directly correlate any actual violations of the law by El Tequila, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4364.0)|
| 1:12:53| They've never been arrested or charged with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4373.0)|
| 1:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4375.0)|
| 1:12:56| That being said, then again, we've got these preconceived assumptions where we've got a quasi-legal body sitting here that's to exercise due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4376.0)|
| 1:13:07| Is that what you understand it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4387.0)|
| 1:13:09| My understanding is, and this is, again, my opinion, the beer board is here to determine if pulling the beer permit would alleviate the issues they're having at that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4389.0)|
| 1:13:21| You think maybe it ought to be a good idea that there ought to be due process requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4401.0)|
| 1:13:23| Have you ever been to a single court hearing in your experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4403.0)|
| 1:13:27| You testified about everything that you've attended, both in federal court, Clinton here, in which the aggrieved has not permitted subpoena power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4407.0)|
| 1:13:37| I don't know if they're issued subpoenas or not or allowed to issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4417.0)|
| 1:13:41| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4421.0)|
| 1:13:43| That being said, what my question was not with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4423.0)|
| 1:13:46| I've asked, have you ever attended a court hearing where the aggrieved does not even have the ability to issue a subpoena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4426.0)|
| 1:13:54| A state court of law, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4434.0)|
| 1:13:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4439.0)|
| 1:14:01| If I may, Mr. Jay, and then I will get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4441.0)|
| 1:14:07| Attorneys, I suppose, could argue all day whether this is considered a due process hearing for our quasi-legal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4447.0)|
| 1:14:20| I personally, as a layperson, cannot answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4460.0)|
| 1:14:25| I do know that the reason we are here is not to prove criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4465.0)|
| 1:14:34| We are here to make a decision with the evidence that's been presented against El Tequila, whether they deter the health, the safety, or the welfare of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4474.0)|
| 1:14:50| So we've bird walked a little bit on a lot of other subjects, what might be legal or not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4490.0)|
| 1:14:58| But again, our role is to look at this specific area that I have read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4498.0)|
| 1:15:08| Mr. Jay, did you have some comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4508.0)|
| 1:15:16| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4516.0)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4520.0)|
| 1:15:22| This is a question for the, I was just looking at our municipal code, our county charter and municipal code as it relates to beer and alcoholic beverages, which is under Chapter 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4522.0)|
| 1:15:36| Looking up the section that the council referenced, this is section, excuse me, I want to make sure I'm, this is section 4.8, penalties punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4536.0)|
| 1:16:00| Section 4-8 and I want to just hold on, I'm going to, I want to find the line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4560.0)|
| 1:16:19| It says the county commission shall not, this is section A, county commission shall not pursuant to TCA 575608 revoke or suspend the permit of a responsible vendor for a clerk's illegal sale of beer to a minor if the vendor and clerk making the sale have complied with the requirements of TCA as a responsible vendor, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4579.0)|
| 1:16:42| That's not what we're addressing today because there haven't been any underage sales, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4602.0)|
| 1:16:47| We're not a responsible vendor either. That's a different category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4607.0)|
| 1:16:53| Go to subsection G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4613.0)|
| 1:16:54| B, the pro, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4614.0)|
| 1:16:55| No, G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4615.0)|
| 1:16:56| D, D, D, D, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4616.0)|
| 1:16:58| G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4618.0)|
| 1:16:59| G, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4619.0)|
| 1:17:00| Gopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4620.0)|
| 1:17:02| And the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4622.0)|
| 1:17:03| Revocation, suspension, or imposition of civil penalty may be for any violation of any provision of article, chapter, or whenever it is satisfactorily appear that the premises of any person, firm, or corporation holding a beer permit under this article are being maintained and operated in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4623.0)|
| 1:17:27| The board is, in considering the suspension or revocation of a permit, shall consider repeated violations of any ordinance or state law involving prohibited sexual contact on the premises and adult-oriented establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4647.0)|
| 1:17:49| Okay, so that's the governing entity in which we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4669.0)|
| 1:17:56| But how do we reconcile that with also the section, and if you can help me find it, that it talks about permanent, oh, here it is, under A, permanent revocation of beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4676.0)|
| 1:18:08| What is a responsible vendor versus this establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4688.0)|
| 1:18:12| Because it does say it has to commit at least two violations within a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4692.0)|
| 1:18:16| The responsible vendor is a separate category that virtually nobody goes through, goes through the state process to become what's called a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4696.0)|
| 1:18:27| And nobody goes through it, or that I've ever, in my years on the board, I've never seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4707.0)|
| 1:18:33| And so the law is a little different with regards to a, quote, responsible vendor under that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4713.0)|
| 1:18:39| Okay, so Altequila is not considered a responsible vendor under the state, so that is not a provision that we can count on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4719.0)|
| 1:18:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4725.0)|
| 1:18:46| Okay, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4726.0)|
| 1:18:49| And as you read, and I wanted to clarify for the board, unlike maybe the city's ordinance, it doesn't require a criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4729.0)|
| 1:18:58| It's what you said, anything that is maintained that affects the morals or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4738.0)|
| 1:19:06| Yeah, it says maintained and operated in such a manner as to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4746.0)|
| 1:19:16| Are there any more questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4756.0)|
| 1:19:27| No, not yet. There's several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4767.0)|
| 1:19:30| We can put on proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4770.0)|
| 1:19:32| No, no, he's sick at 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4772.0)|
| 1:19:34| If Lieutenant Walker is through, he can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4774.0)|
| 1:19:37| He may want to be recalled by the opposing party, but we need Kathy Daly to enter into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4777.0)|
| 1:19:42| The minutes of the meetings in which they've been brought up, just as the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4782.0)|
| 1:19:48| If you could do that, and I've given copies of those minutes to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4788.0)|
| 1:19:54| So we need to get that officially in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4794.0)|
| 1:19:57| All right. Madam Clerk, if you would go ahead and do that, and then we may take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4797.0)|
| 1:20:04| Is it all right if we take a recess before we go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4804.0)|
| 1:20:10| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4810.0)|
| 1:20:13| If I could, I'd like to apologize to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4813.0)|
| 1:20:16| I didn't mean to put a document in there with the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4816.0)|
| 1:20:19| I had less than an hour to type that up before when I was told that you needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4819.0)|
| 1:20:23| So that was my mistake, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4823.0)|

| 1:20:36| obviously, part of the record because it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4836.0)|
| 1:20:39| Otherwise, we're going to be referencing documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4839.0)|
| 1:20:42| that are not going to be part of the record at some point in later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4842.0)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4847.0)|
| 1:20:53| I'm going to let Ms. Daly read the actions of the Bureau Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4853.0)|
| 1:21:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4869.0)|
| 1:21:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4871.0)|
| 1:21:13| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4873.0)|
| 1:21:15| She doesn't have to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4875.0)|
| 1:21:18| No, she doesn't even have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4878.0)|
| 1:21:20| She just puts it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4880.0)|
| 1:21:22| Council has copies of those minutes, and those minutes are in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4882.0)|
| 1:21:33| On behalf of Elder Keeley, I'm not objecting to the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4893.0)|
| 1:21:36| as far as being assimilated into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4896.0)|
| 1:21:39| So with that, for expediency, it saves us from reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4899.0)|
| 1:21:42| I have no question with regards to the accuracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4902.0)|

| 1:22:12| with the reading of the record for the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4932.0)|
| 1:22:16| I have no objection to the submission of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4936.0)|
| 1:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=4939.0)|

| 1:23:30| About close to a little bit over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5010.0)|
| 1:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5012.0)|

| 1:23:57| relative to any investigation request to see tapes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5037.0)|
| 1:24:02| I understand they're not actual tape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5042.0)|
| 1:24:04| but videos relative to events at El Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5044.0)|
| 1:24:08| Yes, and two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5048.0)|
| 1:24:10| Or one event that I know of and the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5050.0)|
| 1:24:13| I didn't get the reason behind looking at the footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5053.0)|
| 1:24:18| All right, did anybody tell you anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5058.0)|
| 1:24:20| about when they came to look at footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5060.0)|

| 1:24:30| when an inquiry was made by law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5070.0)|
| 1:24:34| Did you attempt to comply with that inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5074.0)|
| 1:24:37| and tell the members of the board the results associated with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5077.0)|
| 1:24:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5080.0)|
| 1:24:42| The first time that I got the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5082.0)|
| 1:24:44| they asked for a specific time for us to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5084.0)|
| 1:24:47| I met up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5087.0)|
| 1:24:49| I showed them the footage of the specific date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5089.0)|
| 1:24:52| but it was past two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5092.0)|
| 1:24:54| so we couldn't actually go back to that specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5094.0)|
| 1:24:57| I did ask while they were whispering to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5097.0)|
| 1:25:00| what was the reason behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5100.0)|
| 1:25:02| They didn't answer me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5102.0)|
| 1:25:04| So you were the party that was actually inquired of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5104.0)|
| 1:25:06| relative to video footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5106.0)|
| 1:25:08| and even as we sit here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5108.0)|
| 1:25:10| other than hearing what you've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5110.0)|
| 1:25:12| with regards to allegations of a rape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5112.0)|
| 1:25:14| are you aware of any allegations of a rape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5114.0)|

| 1:25:26| obviously concerning serving alcohol to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5126.0)|
| 1:25:29| What is done to prevent that from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5129.0)|
| 1:25:31| It starts from the beginning with security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5131.0)|
| 1:25:34| We are strict on checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5134.0)|
| 1:25:37| And bartenders as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5137.0)|

| 1:26:53| we did have a liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5213.0)|
| 1:26:55| that there was an amount of percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5215.0)|
| 1:26:57| that we had to show of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5217.0)|
| 1:26:59| We did get with the ABC board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5219.0)|
| 1:27:01| and get our license switched over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5221.0)|
| 1:27:03| to where we're still selling food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5223.0)|
| 1:27:06| with alcohol and with the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5226.0)|
| 1:27:08| but we're not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5228.0)|
| 1:27:10| to show a percentage of the food being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5230.0)|
| 1:27:12| And that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5232.0)|
| 1:27:14| that was approved by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5234.0)|
| 1:27:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5236.0)|
| 1:27:18| And that is the, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5238.0)|
| 1:27:19| the ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5239.0)|
| 1:27:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5241.0)|
| 1:27:23| In relative to the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5243.0)|
| 1:27:25| what have you instructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5245.0)|
| 1:27:27| your bouncers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5247.0)|
| 1:27:29| and your head of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5249.0)|
| 1:27:31| and this had little to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5251.0)|
| 1:27:33| with regards to eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5253.0)|
| 1:27:35| or ameliorating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5255.0)|
| 1:27:37| the situation with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5257.0)|
| 1:27:39| if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5259.0)|
| 1:27:41| misbehavior there at El Tequila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5261.0)|
| 1:27:43| Tell the members of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5263.0)|
| 1:27:45| the steps that you've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5265.0)|
| 1:27:47| and continue to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5267.0)|
| 1:27:49| It doesn't matter what the occasion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5269.0)|
| 1:27:51| They know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5271.0)|
| 1:27:53| AJ knows to take them outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5273.0)|
| 1:27:56| have a word with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5276.0)|
| 1:27:58| and after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5278.0)|
| 1:28:00| they're not allowed back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5280.0)|
| 1:28:02| Relative to situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5282.0)|
| 1:28:04| in which law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5284.0)|
| 1:28:06| have been called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5286.0)|
| 1:28:08| have you been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5288.0)|
| 1:28:10| when law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5290.0)|
| 1:28:12| has been called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5292.0)|
| 1:28:14| I have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5294.0)|
| 1:28:16| in one or two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5296.0)|
| 1:28:17| Nothing further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5297.0)|
| 1:28:19| You may ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5299.0)|
| 1:28:22| Does the board have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5302.0)|
| 1:28:25| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5305.0)|
| 1:28:27| Do you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5307.0)|
| 1:28:29| Mr. Walker spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5309.0)|
| 1:28:31| pictures of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5311.0)|
| 1:28:33| someone coming out with a baby stroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5313.0)|
| 1:28:35| Are you aware of that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5315.0)|
| 1:28:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5317.0)|
| 1:28:38| Okay, can you explain to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5318.0)|
| 1:28:40| Yeah, that was a family event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5320.0)|
| 1:28:42| that we tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5322.0)|
| 1:28:44| but I am very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5324.0)|
| 1:28:45| in time points where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5325.0)|
| 1:28:47| we know kids under age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5327.0)|
| 1:28:49| are not supposed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5329.0)|
| 1:28:51| and I'm very strict with security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5331.0)|
| 1:28:53| and they know when it comes closer to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5333.0)|
| 1:28:55| I don't want any more kids in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5335.0)|
| 1:28:57| But that was a family event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5337.0)|
| 1:28:59| that usually starts really early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5339.0)|
| 1:29:01| throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5341.0)|
| 1:29:03| Okay, so what time was that event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5343.0)|
| 1:29:05| I think it started between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5345.0)|
| 1:29:07| 6 or 5 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5347.0)|
| 1:29:09| And it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5349.0)|
| 1:29:11| when were the children supposed to be out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5351.0)|
| 1:29:13| They need to be out before 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5353.0)|
| 1:29:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5355.0)|
| 1:29:17| Now that I saw, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5357.0)|
| 1:29:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5361.0)|
| 1:29:23| What hours do you usually work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5363.0)|
| 1:29:26| I'm there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5366.0)|
| 1:29:28| Friday from 11 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5368.0)|
| 1:29:31| Then I go back in at around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5371.0)|
| 1:29:33| 5 or 4.55| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5373.0)|
| 1:29:35| until 2.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5375.0)|
| 1:29:37| And that's for Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5377.0)|
| 1:29:39| We recently started opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5379.0)|
| 1:29:41| limited times on Sundays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5381.0)|
| 1:29:43| and then I'm back there on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5383.0)|
| 1:29:45| from 11 to 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5385.0)|
| 1:29:47| between 2 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5387.0)|
| 1:29:49| All right, so during the weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5389.0)|
| 1:29:51| when a lot of problems are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5391.0)|
| 1:29:53| you are also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5393.0)|
| 1:29:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5395.0)|
| 1:29:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5397.0)|
| 1:29:59| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5399.0)|
| 1:30:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5401.0)|
| 1:30:03| So you previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5403.0)|
| 1:30:05| with the Alcohol Beverage Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5405.0)|
| 1:30:07| had a restaurant license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5407.0)|
| 1:30:09| which required you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5409.0)|
| 1:30:11| 50% or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5411.0)|
| 1:30:13| of food sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5413.0)|
| 1:30:15| under that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5415.0)|
| 1:30:17| and switch over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5417.0)|
| 1:30:19| to a limited service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5419.0)|
| 1:30:21| restaurant license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5421.0)|
| 1:30:23| I don't recall on the specific date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5423.0)|
| 1:30:25| but I believe a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5425.0)|
| 1:30:27| over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5427.0)|
| 1:30:29| closer to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5429.0)|
| 1:30:31| Okay, so you've been operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5431.0)|
| 1:30:33| under the limited service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5433.0)|
| 1:30:35| restaurant license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5435.0)|
| 1:30:37| and is that current and up to date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5437.0)|
| 1:30:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5439.0)|
| 1:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5441.0)|
| 1:30:42| It's also stated in the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5442.0)|
| 1:30:44| that all of your servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5444.0)|
| 1:30:46| have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5446.0)|
| 1:30:48| and be through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5448.0)|
| 1:30:50| the alcohol beverage server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5450.0)|
| 1:30:53| Are all your employees current in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5453.0)|
| 1:30:55| All of them, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5455.0)|
| 1:30:57| who are permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5457.0)|
| 1:30:59| I do have a couple that are new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5459.0)|
| 1:31:01| but they have 30 days to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5461.0)|
| 1:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5463.0)|
| 1:31:05| So under that permit process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5465.0)|
| 1:31:07| they're trained also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5467.0)|
| 1:31:09| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5469.0)|
| 1:31:10| if an individual that appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5470.0)|
| 1:31:12| intoxicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5472.0)|
| 1:31:14| they're not supposed to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5474.0)|
| 1:31:16| serving that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5476.0)|

| 1:31:29| onto the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5489.0)|
| 1:31:31| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5491.0)|
| 1:31:33| does the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5493.0)|

| 1:31:44| it's very obvious and they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5504.0)|

| 1:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5511.0)|

| 1:32:13| Just to follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5533.0)|
| 1:32:15| relative to the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5535.0)|
| 1:32:17| asked with regards to the cutoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5537.0)|
| 1:32:19| in individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5539.0)|
| 1:32:21| we've heard testimony that principally dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5541.0)|
| 1:32:23| with intoxicated people in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5543.0)|
| 1:32:25| But that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5545.0)|
| 1:32:27| what is the cutoff point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5547.0)|
| 1:32:29| and what is El Tequila doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5549.0)|
| 1:32:31| on a proactive basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5551.0)|
| 1:32:33| with regards to preventing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5553.0)|

| 1:32:36| within the confines of El Tequila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5556.0)|
| 1:32:38| We do push our menu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5558.0)|
| 1:32:40| our food menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5560.0)|
| 1:32:42| I know that usually helps with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5562.0)|
| 1:32:44| the volume of drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5564.0)|
| 1:32:46| But other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5566.0)|
| 1:32:48| if you see a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5568.0)|
| 1:32:50| going sideways or not talking clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5570.0)|

| 1:32:54| Or even before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5574.0)|
| 1:32:56| I mean, sometimes even the face expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5576.0)|
| 1:33:00| Nothing further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5580.0)|

| 1:33:28| Apparently for the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5608.0)|
| 1:33:29| that happened in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5609.0)|

| 1:34:10| it says I myself counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5650.0)|

| 1:34:27| it's actually on the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5667.0)|
| 1:34:29| right next to the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5669.0)|
| 1:34:31| It actually has the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5671.0)|

| 1:34:39| OK, but that's at the close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5679.0)|
| 1:34:41| The report was filed on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5681.0)|

| 1:34:45| So could you help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5685.0)|
| 1:34:47| see you down below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5687.0)|

| 1:34:57| not 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5697.0)|
| 1:35:00| We have any indication of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5700.0)|
| 1:35:02| what the officer is referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5702.0)|
| 1:35:04| or do you remember this particular day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5704.0)|
| 1:35:06| Advanced don't last to 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5706.0)|

| 1:35:10| so we can close early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5710.0)|
| 1:35:12| Now before 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5712.0)|
| 1:35:14| all those kids are not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5714.0)|

| 1:35:18| So if they stand around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5718.0)|
| 1:35:20| in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5720.0)|
| 1:35:22| or they were outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5722.0)|
| 1:35:23| and they observed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5723.0)|
| 1:35:25| four strollers coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5725.0)|

| 1:35:29| at the close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5729.0)|
| 1:35:31| at the close of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5731.0)|
| 1:35:33| So on October 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5733.0)|
| 1:35:35| which was a Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5735.0)|
| 1:35:37| what time was the close of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5737.0)|
| 1:35:46| It was around 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5746.0)|
| 1:35:48| when we closed the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5748.0)|
| 1:35:50| Do you have any other additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5750.0)|

| 1:35:55| Okay, can you use the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5755.0)|
| 1:35:58| The initial report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5758.0)|
| 1:36:00| when officers were called to the scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5760.0)|
| 1:36:02| was at 2345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5762.0)|

| 1:36:06| That was before officers arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5766.0)|
| 1:36:08| so the officer couldn't have observed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5768.0)|
| 1:36:10| the children being pushed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5770.0)|
| 1:36:12| until after that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5772.0)|
| 1:36:14| Exactly what time after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5774.0)|
| 1:36:16| I have no indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5776.0)|
| 1:36:18| So somewhere between 1145 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5778.0)|
| 1:36:19| and 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5779.0)|
| 1:36:21| is the closing time on that Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5781.0)|
| 1:36:23| Well, I guess I would articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5783.0)|
| 1:36:25| the same objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5785.0)|
| 1:36:27| because what you're pointing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5787.0)|
| 1:36:29| is the obvious problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5789.0)|
| 1:36:31| with regards to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5791.0)|
| 1:36:33| utilizing police reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5793.0)|
| 1:36:35| because the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5795.0)|
| 1:36:37| aren't there subject to cross-examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5797.0)|
| 1:36:39| So what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5799.0)|
| 1:36:41| is we're speculating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5801.0)|
| 1:36:43| with regards to when this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5803.0)|
| 1:36:45| I'm referring, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5805.0)|
| 1:36:47| to her answer that families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5807.0)|
| 1:36:49| always rush out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5809.0)|
| 1:36:51| I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5811.0)|
| 1:36:53| almost near closing time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5813.0)|
| 1:36:55| four strollers came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5815.0)|
| 1:36:57| so there seems to be a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5817.0)|
| 1:36:59| between when the officer says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5819.0)|
| 1:37:01| he saw four strollers come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5821.0)|
| 1:37:03| and you saying it comes out at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5823.0)|
| 1:37:05| I'm not asking to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5825.0)|
| 1:37:07| who's right or who's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5827.0)|
| 1:37:09| There's an obvious conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5829.0)|
| 1:37:11| so I don't think it's as easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5831.0)|
| 1:37:13| as saying families always rush out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5833.0)|
| 1:37:15| get pushed out at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5835.0)|
| 1:37:17| or 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5837.0)|
| 1:37:18| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5838.0)|
| 1:37:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5840.0)|

| 1:37:28| just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5848.0)|
| 1:37:30| Director Buick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5850.0)|

| 1:37:42| of the community, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5862.0)|
| 1:37:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5864.0)|
| 1:37:46| That's a proper reading of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5866.0)|
| 1:37:48| Or the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5868.0)|
| 1:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5870.0)|

| 1:37:56| if you were a supervisor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5876.0)|

| 1:39:12| More reports of disturbances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5952.0)|
| 1:39:14| were reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5954.0)|

| 1:39:22| over-served while at the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5962.0)|

| 1:39:28| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5968.0)|
| 1:39:30| if this was read to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5970.0)|
| 1:39:32| and you had no affiliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5972.0)|

| 1:39:36| would you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5976.0)|
| 1:39:38| that that establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5978.0)|
| 1:39:40| is a detriment to the health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5980.0)|
| 1:39:42| safety, well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5982.0)|
| 1:39:44| or morals of a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5984.0)|
| 1:39:46| Because you're asking her for an emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5986.0)|
| 1:39:48| relative to her being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5988.0)|

| 1:39:54| is once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5994.0)|
| 1:39:56| you're assuming and you're reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5996.0)|
| 1:39:58| from a document by its very definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=5998.0)|
| 1:40:00| is hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6000.0)|
| 1:40:02| It is unsubstantiated at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6002.0)|
| 1:40:04| It is basically a gross exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6004.0)|
| 1:40:06| I have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6006.0)|
| 1:40:08| I don't believe that it's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6008.0)|
| 1:40:10| This was actually reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6010.0)|

| 1:40:17| This was reported by an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6017.0)|
| 1:40:19| per regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6019.0)|

| 1:40:27| It is a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6027.0)|
| 1:40:29| made out of a court or proceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6029.0)|

| 1:41:21| would be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6081.0)|
| 1:41:23| to the health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6083.0)|

| 1:41:27| In my opinion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6087.0)|
| 1:41:29| That's why we opened the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6089.0)|
| 1:41:31| and that's why we've documented it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6091.0)|
| 1:41:33| for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6093.0)|
| 1:41:35| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6095.0)|
| 1:41:37| I didn't know if it was wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6097.0)|
| 1:41:39| Should they tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6099.0)|
| 1:41:41| since we've got basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6101.0)|
| 1:41:42| a witness that's being examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6102.0)|
| 1:41:44| and we then did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6104.0)|
| 1:41:46| because like in the wrestling ring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6106.0)|
| 1:41:48| we tag and we go in and out of the ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6108.0)|
| 1:41:50| I'm just kind of curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6110.0)|
| 1:41:58| I have been instructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6118.0)|
| 1:42:00| that when parties are asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6120.0)|
| 1:42:03| to not interfere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6123.0)|
| 1:42:05| to let everyone have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6125.0)|
| 1:42:08| Is that correct, Mr. Wood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6128.0)|
| 1:42:11| This is an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6131.0)|
| 1:42:13| A lot of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6133.0)|
| 1:42:15| Nobody objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6135.0)|
| 1:42:17| I didn't object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6137.0)|
| 1:42:19| because highly objectionable questions from counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6139.0)|
| 1:42:21| He's doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6141.0)|
| 1:42:23| He's doing the job the way he's supposed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6143.0)|
| 1:42:25| Questions should be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6145.0)|
| 1:42:27| I mean, if you don't have an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6147.0)|
| 1:42:29| you don't know, just say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6149.0)|
| 1:42:31| But no, we've given a lot of leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6151.0)|
| 1:42:33| in these administrative hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6153.0)|
| 1:42:35| to get everything out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6155.0)|
| 1:42:37| whether it's hearsay or not hearsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6157.0)|
| 1:42:38| coming back and asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6158.0)|
| 1:42:40| recalling a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6160.0)|
| 1:42:42| The idea is to get everything out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6162.0)|
| 1:42:44| in the open one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6164.0)|
| 1:42:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6171.0)|
| 1:42:53| For the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6173.0)|

| 1:43:03| that the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6183.0)|
| 1:43:05| that have the beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6185.0)|

| 1:43:08| I believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6188.0)|

| 1:43:14| Could you point them out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6194.0)|

| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6203.0)|
| 1:43:25| And so he's the sole owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6205.0)|
| 1:43:27| No, he has a business partner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6207.0)|

| 1:43:33| so she couldn't attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230822-beer-board?start=6213.0)|
