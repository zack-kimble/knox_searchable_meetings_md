| 2:24:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8677)|
| 2:24:48| Director Brooks, what was the situation with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| I believe you said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| So this one, let me, I can explain it without confusing everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| So Mr. Barnes had previously applied last year for P.R. up to nine for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8700)|
| 2:25:10| It was approved by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| And during the, after that approval, he decided that he wanted to pursue P.R. up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| So he had requested that this be postponed and he submitted a new application because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| at that point he couldn't amend this application because it had already been approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| So he submitted a new one to you all, which you approved last month at P.R. up to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8725)|
| 2:25:31| So we have told him that this application, this is no longer needed, but he did not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| to take it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8736)|

| 2:26:01| I make a motion to withdraw this agenda item 10-F-23-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8761)|

| 2:27:17| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| Seeing none, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| The County Commission is recommending that County Commission approve PR Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8844)|

| 2:27:31| one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| That was a vote of 12-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| Do you want to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| No, ma'am, unless I can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| I will try to make this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| This is actually one unit that I believe when the whole subdivision was surveyed came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8862)|
| 2:27:52| just a hair short, but it was already ready to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8872)|
| 2:28:01| I went and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| It's just one of those few feet short sort of deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve, let me get this right, I'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8888)|
| 2:28:23| a motion that we approve the recommendation of the Planning Commission at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Motion by Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| Second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Director Brooks, can you explain the staff recommended denial because they said it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| make the Dorchester subdivision noncompliant with the approved zoning density of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8921)|
| 2:28:49| So how do we handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| This one is a challenging one because when you look at the request, I mean, they're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| just asking to build one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| I don't think that it would create any issues for the subdivision, but technically the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| has a max density of four dwellings per acre, and this would have pushed it just slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| over and we don't round up, we only round down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8951)|
| 2:29:21| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8961)|
| 2:29:25| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8968)|

| 2:29:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| Yes, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| I'm here for Mr. Gargis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| Mr. Gargis is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| He may have something to speak briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9007)|
| 2:30:08| I know it's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| I want to get to the meat of the bone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Planning Commission recommends denial of the CA General Business zone because it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| compatible with the surrounding development and would encroach into a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| by a vote of 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| I jumped ahead there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| And Mr. I was retained by Mr. Gargis after the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| He, if you remember the April, if you were at the April Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| there was quite a bit of inclement weather, some very heavy storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| He got delayed and was not able to make it when it was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| It was fairly early in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| So the commission, without discussion, voted to approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| And staff did recommend denial on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| But Mr. Gargis was not able to come and talk about why he disagreed with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| or why he thought a commercial zoning might be more appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| And Planning Commission doesn't do what the County Commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| And if someone isn't there, they don't move it to the hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| But their meetings are quite a bit longer most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| And he retained me afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| And I think I've spoken to many of you and I sent an email about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| I do appreciate Commissioner Lee making herself available on a Saturday afternoon to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| to me about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| I appreciate that accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| This property is in a very, very odd location in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9099)|
| 2:31:48| I think the house on there actually had to be moved out of the right-of-way back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9108)|

| 2:32:05| And it's controlled by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| This property is zoned ag because it had been a single-family residence for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9129)|
| 2:32:16| But all around it, with the exception to the mobile home park to the east, has been basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| a commercial development that has been growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9142)|

| 2:32:35| There's a food city in the immediate vicinity, an advanced auto, Walgreens, there's a self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9155)|

| 2:32:49| I think there's actually a houseboat location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| And Mr. Gargis purchased the property in 2018, and he's not had anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9174)|
| 2:33:01| He purchased it for investment purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| He is a retired developer and broker, but he's not in that business anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9184)|
| 2:33:11| But he thought this would be a good parcel to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| But he hasn't had any real serious offers on it, except people have asked him about commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9196)|
| 2:33:22| So he thought the best thing to do was see if he could get this zoned to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| and with the CA zoning that is consistent with what is around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| It has 460 feet of frontage on Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| He spoke to TDOT, and they said, you have 460 feet of frontage, you can get access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| Powell Drive, but before we really know what that access would look like, we need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| So you kind of have the cart before the horse scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| You don't know what kind of access you're going to need until you know what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| business is going to go in there, but you don't know what kind of business is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| to go in there until you have the commercial zoning, and they're willing to really take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| it on and do the investment in the engineering to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9236)|
| 2:34:01| So he wanted to go ahead and get it zoned to commercial to make it more marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| It does have access along Lake Spur, but no one is going to use that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| It would have to be accessed on Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| Of course, when Powell Drive was completed, you would think building a major arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| road through the county would spur additional commercial investment into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| I know there's concerns with the mobile home park that's there to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| That's one of the reasons I think that residential really isn't appropriate, and I'm not Castaneda's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9272)|

| 2:34:50| lot of high-end housing, so that's one of the reasons, and since 2020 in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9290)|

| 2:35:02| areas needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| No one's looked at this property and said, let's make this PR at three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| or whatever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| It just is not really marketable for something like that, so I think a small commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| would be more consistent with that area as it's growing and trending, and we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9314)|
| 2:35:21| some of the impacts to the residential neighborhood with buffering along that eastern boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9321)|
| 2:35:28| That's something that would be very appropriate for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| There are sidewalks on Powell Drive, and so that's there already along on this side, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9329)|

| 2:35:41| someone wanted to access some type of neighborhood market there or something like that, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9341)|
| 2:35:48| do think that all these things considered a commercial zoning would be a lot more appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9348)|
| 2:35:55| and in particular, if the next ordinance that we have passes, the CA zoning would also allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| there to be considerations that already allows considerations for single family, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9361)|

| 2:36:13| the planning staff and many of the commissioners have worked on very hard, so by changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9373)|

| 2:36:20| It just gives a lot more flexibility to allow some mixed-use development, which is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| with what the sector plan was at the time it was filed, which was this mixed-use special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9385)|

| 2:39:52| I know how long it takes to get anything done with the state, and my fear and concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| is that you will go through this process to rezone this piece of property, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| state will come back and deny you access, and then you're back kind of at the drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9602)|

| 2:40:17| access, and TDOT has stated they have issues with the site distance, so I'm very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9617)|
| 2:40:25| about the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| My other question is, was neighborhood commercial something that was discussed or considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9627)|
| 2:40:35| Commissioner Frazier, after we had that conversation on the neighborhood commercial, I did talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9635)|

| 2:40:57| Typically neighborhood commercial, you see it at an intersection, and the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| is that, you know, the neighborhood commercial wouldn't allow considerations for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| where the CA, if the next ordinance passes, would, so we think the CA would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| I mean, the site distance, Mr. Gargis did have conversations with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9672)|
| 2:41:17| His recollection of those conversations are slightly different than what staff's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| says, that they would grant access, but the type of access may depend on the intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| of the use, so I know you have reluctance on granting a zoning without knowing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| the use is, but, you know, there's zones out there all the time for vacant lots that aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| developed yet, and that's a risk that Mr. Gargis is willing to take upon himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| Also, CA doesn't require any landscaping or lighting, and so if you were doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| that is commercial, I would hope that you would be willing to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| Well, I suggested that this body has the authority to impose a landscaping buffer along the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| boundary, which is within your authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| There's partial there now, and it's been there for, I'd say, eight to ten, maybe 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9721)|
| 2:42:08| but the house will sit where the interstate, where the road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| In the back, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| Those are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| Mr. Moyers, can we say pending access to the State Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9739)|
| 2:42:31| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9751)|
| 2:42:40| Making you work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| You know, rezoning is a legislative act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I don't know that you can make the legislation dependent on some other thing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9764)|
| 2:42:52| You could rezone it with a condition that it not use whatever access you find is inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9772)|
| 2:43:01| because then you're making the act right now, but by doing that, it's kind of up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| Ben, you got something to say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| I mean, it does have access along Lakesburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| No one wants to use that access along Lakesburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| Any access for this would have to be on Powell Drive, and we would have to get that approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| So, if you zone it, we can't get the access, then, you know, the property's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9804)|
| 2:43:29| harm anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| So, you could condition it that whatever that road is that nobody wants to use, that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| not use that road as access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| Briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I forgot to say something about what the state did say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| They did inform me that when they gave me the curb cut, which they said they were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| going to deny me one yet, but when I got it, I had to make Lakesburg a road that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9830)|
| 2:43:57| could have a through road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| They said they didn't want a through road from coming down Lakesburg, going out into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| New Axis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| So, they had to close it, you know, not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| It's got utilities on it, so you have to own it to go out there, but you put a gate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| So, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Are you saying that prior to the road opening that Lakesburg connected with the old road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9856)|
| 2:44:24| It was a through road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| The state didn't want it to become a through road where somebody...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| I couldn't understand that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| Can I ask one more question before we go to the district commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9881)|
| 2:44:42| Is that okay, Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| Am I understanding that if we do rezone this, that we would need to change the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9886)|
| 2:44:54| There would need to be a plan amendment because it's suburban mixed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| It would have to be sent back to Planning Commission for consideration of a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9897)|
| 2:45:06| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| I'll be real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| I think this property's only got three uses, commercial, corn, or Clayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9909)|
| 2:45:17| Nobody's going to build houses on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| It's either going to get zoned commercial or it's going to have to be planted in corn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| or somebody's going to put trailers on it because that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9925)|
| 2:45:32| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| This will be one time that I will go on record agreeing with Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| I like Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| If you go over to this place, there's 50 plus mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| They mow their grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| Big wheels are sitting in the yard, little bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| The food city is across Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| It's not right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| This is a little community that I think is more appropriate for more mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| We need housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| We don't need business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| This backs up to Powell Drive, which is a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| It would devastate this little mobile home part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| There's a lot of people that live there that cannot afford to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| I think we would be taking away their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| Travis Meats is not too far from there, but there's a little lane that goes down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| so it's separated, but I would agree and I would not support rezoning this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=9993)|
| 2:46:43| If anybody would drive in there and see the little ... I mean, you talk about protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| little cul-de-sacs and little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| This is a very well-kept little mobile home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| It's not real high end, but I've drove by there when there's been school buses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10014)|
| 2:47:01| stopped there and 50 or 60 kids get off the school bus at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| I don't think that this would be appropriate to change the zoning, so I wouldn't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10028)|
| 2:47:15| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| I'd like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| I also went there and sat there, and Commissioner Lee is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| I think I stopped counting at like 38 kids getting off that bus, and it's a very well-kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10048)|
| 2:47:41| mobile home community and certainly serves a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10061)|
| 2:47:47| I guess where I would disagree is that because there cannot be and will not be any access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10067)|
| 2:47:56| from that side, I don't really see it affecting that mobile home park at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10076)|
| 2:48:11| The entrance and exit really would have to be from Powell Drive, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| It just would have to be, and there's really only one kind of short border that it shares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10096)|
| 2:48:25| and if there's an appropriate buffer there, because otherwise the property really becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10105)|
| 2:48:36| of no value at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| Commissioner Peeler was pretty much right about that, and I'm not even sure trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| get any more mobile homes back there, because you sure wouldn't access it off of Larkspur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10128)|
| 2:49:03| That's just about impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| That was my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| I was just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| I do have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| Dr. Brooks, what zones are appropriate for suburban mixed residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10155)|
| 2:49:29| For suburban mixed residential, you can consider actually quite a few zones, so RAE, RA, RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10169)|
| 2:49:37| the range of planned residential zones, as well as a transition zone, CN, OB, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10177)|
| 2:49:46| office medical and related uses, and then civic institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10186)|
| 2:49:55| Mr. Mullins, would you or your client consider any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10195)|
| 2:50:04| When we filed the application, the sector plans were in place for this mixed use special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| district where the CA was allowed at that, which is the reason we considered that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=10209)|
