| 0:01:14| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| amending the Knox County Code Appendix A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| Zoning Article VI entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| Administration, Enforcement, and Interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| by amending subsection 6.40.01 and 6.50.07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=83)|
| 0:01:32| and adding a new subsection 6.50.08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| to provide for the development plan appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| to a court of conflict jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990 is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=104)|
| 0:01:54| On second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Is there a motion? Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| After conversations with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| it's been brought to my attention that the amended version of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| could constitute a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| so I'll make a motion that we pass this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| that we pass this ordinance as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| That second is by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| All right, we do have, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| we do have a couple of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| That was my question, that the individuals were public here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| We have Kevin Murphy and Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| if you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| We'll give you, well, you always use your time wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| We'll set the timer at three minutes like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| but we won't cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| All right, three minutes, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I was expecting five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| This is the eighth public, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| This is the ninth public meeting in 63 days discussing this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| Probably set a new record for how fast the zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| has been initiated at the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| and then come back and reach second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| It's consumed a lot of your time, staff's time, and the community's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| to look at an issue that we believe is not broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| nor an obstacle to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| or a meaningful contributor to our housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Uses on review and development plans are the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| For years, both applications have been appealed to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| and we believe this is the way it should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We ask that you codify in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| by adding development plans to the current use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| That way, both are appealed using the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| It's the simplest, most straightforward fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| and there's a lot of value in simple and not changing something that's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| You, the county commissioner, are involved at the rezoning step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| The rezoning hearing's both here and at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| I frequently hear, this is just rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| It has to go back to planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| where you'll see the detailed plan, and you'll have a say then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| The mayor is correct that the public has three opportunities for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| but two of those are at the rezoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| The development plan or request for use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| is not presented at either of the rezoning hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| There is nothing related to the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| that the public can review and comment on at those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Rezoning can also occur years before a development plan is brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| or you could have a development plan application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| for something that was developed previously, and now there's a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| So there's only one time the public gets to comment on a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| and that's the one time it goes to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Development plans are the nitty-gritty details examining traffic, lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| landscaping, parking, where uses are and aren't on the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| They're required in seven zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| as well as when a use on review is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| For years there's been a mandatory first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| the hearing at planning commission, and then an optional second step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| an appeal to BZA where it's heard de novo and the BZA can reweigh the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| The second step appeal has been used 16 times in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| The appeal is by far the exception, not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| A lot has been made of perceived increased volume of appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| and claims are made that appeals are red tape that's contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| to the housing crisis in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| I'm in tech, and we make data-driven decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Here's the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| We're talking about six appeals in the last 24 months, 16 in the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| And for a comparison, 2014-2015, there were five appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| It ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Right now we're in a flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| In the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| three of those six appeals were development plans for residential subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Two of those appeals resulted in minor modifications to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| like recognizing a blue line stream or adding pedestrian connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| The third development plan, BZA, simply affirmed the planning commission decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Three appeals of development plans in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| all resolved in seven weeks of the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| In our opinion, the data does not support a claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| that these appeals are a significant contributor to the housing shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| and we're not aware of any data that would support that claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| The neighborhoods are stirred up about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| because there's a lot of time and effort involved engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| If you take when the development plan is noticed in that three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| that's a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| If you have an engaged and aware neighborhood to alert your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| communicate with the staff to get the information on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| talk to the applicant, understand the proposal and the impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| including details on traffic studies, lighting, and landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| which you might need an expert for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| come up with ideas to mitigate and improve, communicate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| maybe have a neighborhood meeting with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| communicate with the staff again, prepare written and oral arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| and finally present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| That's a huge effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| The applicant's been working on it for months with engineers helping them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| and the expectation is the neighborhood do that in three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| That's why they want the opportunity to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| because sometimes you just can't get through all that in three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Planning Commission very, very seldom grants a delay to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| to allow further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=428)|

| 0:07:12| then that gives everybody a little bit more time, a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| to work through those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=435)|

| 0:07:24| even the applicant, to go through that appeal first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| before sending it on to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| If it goes to court, it's going to be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=449)|

| 0:08:42| Yeah, but you asked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| She wanted to speak on 54, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Yeah, but 54—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| When we're done with this item, she's more than welcome to speak on 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=532)|

| 0:09:00| No, this—yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Mr. Thompson was down—that may be backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Mr. Thompson was down to speak on number 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| I had you down to speak on ordinance 022-6104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| No, I signed up for item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| That was an error on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Of course, we didn't hear 54, so we wouldn't have called for you at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| but we're going to visit 54 as soon as this is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| and if the applicant's not here, you are more than welcome to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=569)|

| 0:09:33| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=573)|

| 0:09:41| if he had questions, but I'm—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Mr. Moyers, in one of the remarks earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| Mr. Thompson cited a court ruling requiring essentially all appeals to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| I believe it was a 1990 case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Can you help clarify your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| That's the BFI decision, and the BFI decision was primarily about the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| of whether or not the county commission could reserve to itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| the power to hear use-on-review decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| in other words, grant itself appellate authority over the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| The court found that it could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| It went on to talk about where such appeals should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| It relied heavily in making that decision on the language of Section 6.60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| which specifically gives to the county Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| the power to hear and decide in accordance with the provisions of Article 4—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| I'll skip part of that—of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| appeals from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| of decisions regarding uses-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| So it was relying on the language already in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| But when you look at the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| the state law is much more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| In terms of appeals, the state law says that the board can hear appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| where it's decided there's an error in the decision of the county building commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| or other administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| It does not list the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| even though the planning commission is mentioned frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| throughout the remainder of the ordinance or the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Now, I have located a case called Rogers Group v. County of Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| and this case addresses that question specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| because the question of whether or not that language was broad enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| to include the planning commission was not really brought up in the BFI case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| But in this case, it was the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| because in this case the Franklin County Planning Commission was being appealed to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| and it argued that, no, you have to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| The Court of Appeals said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Now, let me step back and say that they were construing the Franklin County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| but the Franklin County Zoning Ordinance tracks the language of the state statute exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| It says that the Board of Zoning Appeals in their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| has the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| there's an error in any order requirement, permit, decision, implication, determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| or refusal made by the building commissioner or other administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| The court goes on to analyze that and says that, finally, just to cut to the chase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| if the drafters of the resolution had intended for planning commission actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| to be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| we believe that they would have expressly provided for such review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| by designating as appealable those decisions of the Franklin County Regional Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| and would not have used the term other administrative official to refer to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| So that is the closest case to being directly on point, frankly, that I've seen in a long career of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| The only distinction is they're looking at the Franklin County Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| what Mr. Thompson is referring to as the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| but the language is essentially identical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and the rules of statutory interpretation would apply just as strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| In my opinion, if the state legislature had intended for the planning commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| or for the Board of Zoning Appeals to have authority to hear planning commission appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| it would have said planning commission appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| It wouldn't have used a term as specific as the singular administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| So, no, I do not agree that state law requires this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| I think the reason that these appeals go to the BZA is because that power was given to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| specifically in 6.60.03C of our zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| and I would remind the body, as I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| that that refers specifically to uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| and nowhere mentions an appellate authority regarding development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| So, in that last sentence, are you saying that for as long as potentially all of us remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=853)|
| 0:14:21| or have been involved, that the BZA should have heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| always should hear the uses on review concept plan, but not the development plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| The way I read the zoning ordinance, development plans are not included in the BZA's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| When you look at section 6.5 of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| which talks about procedure for authorizing uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| in the second paragraph, there's a distinction drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| These development plans and uses permitted on review shall be reviewed by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| When you go on through it, 6.50.06, approval or denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| planning commission may approve a development plan or use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| where it can be shown that, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| You go on down a little bit farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| The planning commission may deny a development plan or use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| The conjunction is important because it indicates that those are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| So, the planning commission may deny a development plan or use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| When you get down to 6.50.07, where it talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Board of Zoning Appeals review of action of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| it says that any person, firm, or corporation agreed by any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission relative to uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| may petition the Board of Zoning Appeals to consider the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Notice that development plan, which has been used in all the prior paragraphs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| is omitted from the section regarding BZA appeals for planning commission action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| So, as I read it, they don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| I'm sorry. I'm sitting back like I'm sitting in a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| As I read it, they don't have that authority and have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| But have been hearing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Have been hearing them because everybody has kind of agreed on that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Okay. So, I think this is where it gets...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| There's a lot of parts to this, but I think it gets to the heart of, you know, really the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| And I was sitting down, actually, with Mr. Murphy and his colleagues last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| and, you know, it's always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| And I said to them, as I will say to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| we have time and again come across things in government where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| whether it's because we have term limits and we're only here for a short amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| or law directors change, or administrations change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| that every once in a while we find something and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| why are we doing it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Well, we're always doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| And then we go back, is that the way we're supposed to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| We discover these things quite often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| and have to go back and either adjust rules and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| So I wanted to go through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| because when I started digging into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| and I have a giant file of a thousand things to read on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| I wanted to first know, what does the law say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| What does our ordinance, which is our local law, say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| And it says that uses on review are appealable to BZA but not development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| That is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| It is accurate in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Development plans are not mentioned as one of the things that they can appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| It does not say not development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| They're just not mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| They're just not mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| In either the section that grants them the authority generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| or the section that deals with procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And we've been told by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| unless it says you can, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| So there's nothing assumed in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| So that helped me sort of think through the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Then I spent some time with Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| and I think it's really important for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| because I think that this has been, frankly, skewed and hijacked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| into stealing of rights when I'm not sure people understand the nuts and bolts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| And I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| It's super complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Help us understand what a use on review is versus a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| because a development plan is a very different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Mr. Snowden, if you could sort of walk through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| because I really dug in deep with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Tell me what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| You know, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| The term development plan isn't defined in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| So you kind of have to back into it by looking at what it talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| constitutes a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| And what it says, and it's in nine different zones it references it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| it talks about that the development plan shall be signed and stamped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| by a design professional, either a licensed engineer or a licensed architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Within that, there are things such as stormwater plans and drainage plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| There's talks about the buildings, the roads, the driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| designed to promote safe and efficient movement of vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| So I look at a development plan as something that is technical in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| that requires a level of certification such as a professional engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| or a landscape or, pardon me, an architect would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Whereas a use on review is really determining is that use appropriate for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| Those are the two different, I guess, the way I would look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| in my simple mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| And when you think about a body like BZA that is made of appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| I mean each of the commissioners appoint a citizen representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| when I look at those two things, uses on review versus development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| citizen representative fits with uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| Is it appropriate, subjective, versus development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| which is something that is a stamp certified technical document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Do you feel like we're on the same page there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Would you ask an ordinary citizen to do a stamp to make a judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| on something that a licensed engineer needs to sign off on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| I'm a licensed engineer, so I'm probably a little bit biased in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| I think it's a very technical field and something that maybe a layperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| maybe doesn't have the necessary qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| I'm not saying that's why they're split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| As I started to dig through it, it seemed to be better understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| why you have a BZA and why you have citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| To have a citizen input every single time on something that a licensed engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| needs to stamp didn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| The parts didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| I'm going to yield, and I know there's lots more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I have a few as well, but I just wanted to kind of lay that out at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| of what is the law and what is the appropriateness of what a BZA is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Mr. Thompson, I saw you sitting back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I didn't see you earlier, and I think the number you had signed up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| got transposed with what Ms. Feld had signed up for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| so I see now that you actually intended to speak on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| and you did earlier, but you're more than welcome to take the podium now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| and speak to the body on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| Bob Thompson, 8136 Jonesboro, Knox County, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| The part that you're all avoiding, the part you're all talking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| is that the ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| development plan applications shall be reviewed in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| with the use on review procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Now, why are you not mentioning that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Why are you not thinking about what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Can you address that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Why are you not facing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Would you like Mr. Moyers to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I would like anyone who wants to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Follow the procedure of 6.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| It's what I was just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| There's a whole procedure for the approval of uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| When you get down to 6.50.07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| which is part of those procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| it gives the Board of Zoning Appeals the right to review uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| but it does not mention development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| So if the Board of Zoning Appeals was intended to have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| to review development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| one would think that it would say that the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| or that any person, firm, or corporation agreed by any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission relative to uses permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| or development plans may appeal those to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| In three paragraphs above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| it makes that distinction about a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| or use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| The next paragraph down, it does it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| So one would think that if it was the intent to have development plans go to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| they would have simply said uses on review and or development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| And so because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| I'm left to conclude that the intent was to allow the BZA to hear use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| appeals but not development plan appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| And that is the procedure that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| But again, why did the ordinance say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| why does it say we're going to review development plan applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| in accordance with the use on review procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Now there's been a distinct, you've attempted to distinguish between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| but if you look at the nature of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| they are actually, it makes sense to have them go to the same procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| because a development plan becomes a unique thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| It may have houses that you'd say, well, yeah, houses are no big thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| but the overall arrangement, houses, roads, recreation areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| it makes it a unique plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| and that is more comparable to a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| It's not a use of right to have this unique plan be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| It is something that just makes perfect sense for it to be in accordance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| the use permitted on review procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| I understand what you're, I've heard what you're saying about the appeal section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| does not specifically mention development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| but they are in fact incorporated within the use on review procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| So it's perfectly reasonable to read the appeal procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| the appeal section as including development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| which are treated as uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| One other, and may I, without stopping there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| may I mention one thing you mentioned about the Browning-Ferris case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| You said that that opinion depended a lot on our zoning ordinance 6.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| but at the time that opinion was decided, we didn't have the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| I don't know what the 6.6 said at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| but in 1991 we amended 6.6 to follow what the Browning opinion said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| So I think there's probably two different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| If I was going to rely on 6.6 as it existed at the time of Browning-Ferris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I would have to go back historically to see what it was then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| And I'm sorry to speak so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I'd appreciate the opportunity to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| I believe Commissioner Schoonmaker's light was on next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and then we have Commissioners Ward and Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| So Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| I've got a couple of questions for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| In trying to go through the paperwork as far as your responsibility in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:23| we asked that the Planning Commission give us an opinion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| But yet the planning staff never made a recommendation to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| and that's highly unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Why did it follow that path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| The planning staff in consultation with our attorney provided the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| and options for the Planning Commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| I would say this is somewhat unusual to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| I'm not sure that the Planning Commission has considered something like this in recent memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| So we did provide them with the background, provided them with different options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| and let them make that recommendation to send forward to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| But didn't offer a specific recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| And then on the June 9th meeting when the Planning Commission met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| did each planner as part of their packet have a copy of the Knox County ordinances in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:32| I'm not sure I followed the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Well, the whole intent was they were supposed to make minor amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| to the Knox County zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| but if the Planning Commissioners didn't have that information in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| how were they going to be able to make the changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Maybe it's the late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| I'm still not following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| They do have tablets in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| They have access to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| They have access to all the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| But you didn't provide that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| They would have had to have done their own research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| I guess my point is do we need to send this back to you guys to get the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| We need to send this back to you so that they have an opportunity –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| because they didn't really talk about the zoning ordinance, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| They talked about – during the discussion period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| they were talking more about advanced Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| and what we're doing with planned residential and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| No, they were considering these amendments, the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| Now, in terms of where their conversation went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| that's within their purview to talk about whatever they so choose as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| But they were presented with the different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| They had the request in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| So I don't know that this would need to go back to them for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah, I'll allow someone else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I believe what Mr. Thompson is referencing is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| and actually I had this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| If you look at the planned commercial zone, it's 5.33.13, Part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:24| .13, Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| Part A, a development plan for the planned commercial complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| I think that's where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Well, I have said from the beginning of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| that this zoning ordinance has evolved over a period, probably 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| and there have been changes here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| and they're not always internally consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| I am convinced of my view, at least as far as most of these zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| that one is an exception because it actually denominates the development plan as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| I think the point of the ordinance is to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| But that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| That is a place where it is not consistent with other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| I believe there are seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| I believe there are seven zonings, specific zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| that actually say almost those exact same words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| And so therein lies our objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| And in those cases where they actually call a development plan a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I think under the current law that could probably go to the Planning Commission, to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| In the PR zone, it's not denominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Mr. Murphy, would you mind if Mr. Murphy answers that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I think he might have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Commissioner Chairman Wheeler and Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| So we've tried to provide an analysis of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| we have at least found development plan term used in seven zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| and there are one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Three that have this exact wording, planned commercial shopping center in transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| all say that a development plan for the zone shall be submitted to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| for approval as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| The planned residential says, a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| said development plan application shall be made in conformity with the section 6.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| procedure for authorizing uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Then town center zone also says approval of a development plan subject to the section 6.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| subject requirements of 6.50, procedures for authorizing uses of review, section 4.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So that's where a lot of the confusion comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| because we're reading appeals in section 6.60 or 5.00,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I can't remember which one it is today, and then there's also these other sub ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| So that is what really, if you take us who at least look at this a lot, we're confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| and then you take a resident that has never seen this and tries to read it, they get really confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| So we would love to see more clarity and simple process. That's our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Mr. Snowden, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Yeah, talking to Commissioner Durrett, I noticed that too in the PC zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| and I think that it comes back to in the PC zone that there's no uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| every use is a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| So we struggled with that too. I think that's the distinction there that we kind of captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Mr. Snowden. Commissioner Durrett, apologies, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you. It's also in the next one, which is the shopping center zone, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:58| I mean, in the transition zone, there's several more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| but one other question I had was are concept plans required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| when a development plan is submitted to planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| I'm sorry? I guess this would be for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| It's a two-parter, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Is there a difference between a concept plan and a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and if there is, is that concept plan required for a development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Or is a plan to be submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| A concept plan is not always required as part of the development plan or use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| The concept plan is a product that comes out of, it adheres to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| so it's a different set of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| But it is not always required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Any further discussion? Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Kind of playing off what Commissioner Durrett was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Mr. Law Director, if we are concerned that the wording of the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| is not included in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| could we not add to the Knox County zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| that development plans are just appealed to the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| And then if we did that, would that satisfy with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| Yes. I mean, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I guess there are some, including Mr. Kline who was here earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| who have argued that our zoning authority is completely dependent on state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| And if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| then having any appeal go to the BZA from the Planning Commission is questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| But I believe we have more authority because we are a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And because of that, I do believe that we could give the Board of Zoning Appeals that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| That's what the planning authority would like you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| The mayor has asked for it to go in the opposite direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| and have development plans be appealable straight to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| And now what the new amendment that has taken us back to first reading would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| is allow the applicant and any agreed person the opportunity to go to BZA if they wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| and hash it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| If my interpretation of this is correct, and it might not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I'll fully admit I've been wrong before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I've been reversed by the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| But if it is correct, then currently the BZA really has no authority to hear development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| So if that interpretation is correct, then the ordinance that is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| would actually provide the BZA more authority to hear development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| than it currently has under the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Now, the Planning Alliance wants you to codify development plans to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| That's not what's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But could you do that as a matter of law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I believe, yes, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2171)|

| 0:36:44| I don't know if the general citizen would have the technical knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2204)|

| 0:36:58| Can you give us an example of a couple of things that you all do as stamp-signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| and licensed engineers during the development review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I mean, we're looking at horizontal and vertical alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| We're looking at things from past history that we've seen in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| that just due to our experience, in addition to the technical knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| are these things going to create problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I mean, I just don't know if folks that don't have that training and expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| would be able to make good, sound decisions in those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2253)|

| 0:37:47| I'm not sure I follow the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I mean, if development plans, which seems to be more of an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| engineering review, if those were appealable and Citizen X said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| I want to appeal this development plan because I think the road ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| over here instead of over there, in their opinion, that's a subjective opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| and every single development plan was appealable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| what would it do to essentially being able to build anything in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| It would be very laborious, without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And, you know, I mean, there's been a lot of re-engineering and, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I just don't know if, you know, sometimes ideas are great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| but it's hard to flesh them out on a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| So I think that would create a very laborious process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| I'd like to ask Commissioner Smith to sort of go back to the ordinance that is before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2325)|

| 0:39:08| That is a huge misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2348)|

| 0:39:14| This is not about whether we – this is in the weeds, does it go this way or that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| does this piece of paper go this way or that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2360)|

| 0:39:25| And I'd like to sort of back up just for a second and ask Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| to sort of walk through what does this ordinance do and what does it not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| One moment, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| I'm going to let Commissioner Smith speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| In the last year, there's been 54 cases before the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| This ordinance would affect three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| It's an attempt to take what you're describing as technical engineering calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| and put those in the hands of the experts, the engineers, the planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| the people who are trying to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I have nothing against BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| The man that I've appointed to BZA owns an electrical company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| I'd go to him if I needed to wire something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| I'm not sure if that's the place that you send true development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| These things are technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And you say what could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| For $250, somebody could stand up there and slow every development down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| I think it's time that we show some political will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| You know, maybe the answer is that MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| give them more time to get stuff on the record that they question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| You know, I've heard Kevin Murphy say you only get five minutes, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| Maybe we gave them 10 or 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Maybe MPC needs to be willing to grant delays more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| But when it comes to these technical things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| I want the right people making these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| And even though the BZA is in the appointed position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| things can still get political at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I think this takes the politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| I think it gets it into the hands of the people that have the degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| and stamps to say what is right and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Mr. Thompson, I'm going to allow one more response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Just in the interest of our procedures, because this is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| not a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2497)|

| 0:41:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Just responding to the idea mentioned by Mr. Snowden and Mr. Smith just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| that development plans are technical things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| We require experts, not citizen volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| But citizen volunteers are on the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| and the planning commission reviews the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| BZA members are virtually identical to planning commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Citizen volunteers, they receive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| They have access to the planning staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| How can you say planning commission members are qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| whereas BZA members are not qualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| Can someone please address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Any other response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Oh, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| Mr. Moyers, the case that you cited, I think you said it was Franklin County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| at the beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| And you stated that because development plan was not specifically mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2572)|
| 0:43:05| then that your assumption would be that it is excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| Is that what I'm hearing you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Well, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| The Franklin County case stands for the proposition that where the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| says the Board of Zoning Appeals has the authority to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| let me quote the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| to hear and decide appeals where it's alleged by the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| that there's an error in any order, requirement, permit, decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| implication, determination, or refusal made by the building commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| or other administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| And the Board of Zoning Appeals can hear that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| That's the state statutory language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| In this case, the question was does the term other administrative official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| include the planning commission, and the answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| I bring this case up because it has been alleged that state law requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| that the BZA have this authority, and I think that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| The BZA has this authority specifically because it's given to them in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| ordinance in Section 6.60.03 and in Section 6.50.07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| But in neither one of those sections is development plan mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| even though development plan is a term that is used throughout the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2657)|

| 0:44:24| And so then you get into the art and science, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| of statutory interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| And there are rules of statutory interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| and one of those rules is that you must assume that the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| used every word with intent and did not put words in by intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| I could look at that and go, well, that's probably just an error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| just a mistake, sloppy drafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| But in interpreting a statute, I'm not allowed to make that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| A judge interpreting a statute must look at the statute that he has in front of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| He can't add terms to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| He can't take terms away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| He has to read it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| And that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I'm drawing on my fairly extensive experience as a Chantry Court judge in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| reading the statute and drawing on that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I'd have to do you a treatise on the rules of statutory construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| but I'll just have to ask you to trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| That's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| And I appreciate very much what you're stating on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| Is there anything, though, to prevent us from adding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| That's what I told Ms. Schneider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| If we have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Okay, here's the two-part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I do not believe the state statute requires or directs the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Zoning Appeals to hear use on review or any kind of appeal from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| The legislature could have directed that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| They didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| This Rogers versus Franklin County case says that that lack means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| they don't have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| We have given that authority to the Board of Zoning Appeals by virtue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| the fact that we are a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| There's a question about whether we had the authority to do that in 1987| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| when the BFI case was decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| But regardless of that, we have that authority now, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Because we have the authority, I believe, to give the BZA the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| to look at use on reviews, we could, if we wish, give them the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| to look at development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I read the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| That is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| I have to assume that the Planning Alliance also agrees that it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| unclear because they're asking you to do exactly that and amend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| include development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Then you get into the realm of what you should do, and that's not my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| I'm just telling you what is and what can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| That's exactly what I wanted to have reiterated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| My second comment, this is to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| I really do appreciate what you said about with some things there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| definitely a level of expertise needed that others may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| And you mentioned a few situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Can you tell me, since I think you've looked pretty closely at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| probably 15, 16 cases that have been appealed, actually appealed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| past, and I have not studied them a certain way that you have, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| seems to me that a lot of these things really did not quite rise to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| level of needing a trained and educated person in one specific area to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2874)|
| 0:48:04| address some of the changes that were in fact made or not made when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| were appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Do you understand what I'm saying here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| I mean, you know, sometimes it's a matter of just adding, wanting more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| adding more in the appeal, which has nothing to do with whether technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| it's something that would be something more under your preview as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| your expertise in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Yeah, I can't think of anything specific that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| You know, if we was looking at more of a specific case, I could maybe think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Put on the spot, it's kind of hard to say, but so I'd want to kind of reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| judgment on that, maybe kind of reconsider and get back with you on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| just because right now I just don't have anything in my mind that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| triggers one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Is it fair to say that some of the things that were appealed actually did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| involve a specific level of expertise because it was perhaps more landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| or cosmetic or a matter of convenience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I mean, I can think of the most recent one was the one on Mission Hill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| The appellant alleged that there would be unsafe roadway conditions created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| by that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| From an engineering perspective, we felt like that was an incorrect statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| The sight lines were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| The roadway geometry was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| So that one was one that I think did get into that design component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| So it's both things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| I mean, it's the design component as well as more of the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| the softer components of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| So that kind of falls into a lot of the other areas we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| It might be nice if you had a level of expertise, but if you didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| much as you said with your point to Planning Commission and BCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| it's the people that serve on those boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| whether they have a specific level of expertise or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| And just one more comment, really, that several have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| the perception is wrong and that a citizen's rights may be taken away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:42| or may not be taken away because this change occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| And clearly the perception is very much that many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| many citizens feel like they are going to be losing a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| I know you have all been as bombarded as I have with the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| It's actually been quite incredible with that very specific concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| a citizen losing a right to have a voice through this appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| And we can argue, oh, well, really, you're not losing that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| But I would just suggest that we think about the fact that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| this is something that citizens have been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| It has been there, and they have been able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Whether it was right or wrong, it's there, and it has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| So when you say to someone, well, no, you can't do that anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| that is, in fact, a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| That is, in fact, a takeaway of what your perception is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| because you could do it a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| So I'm not real sure the misperception is quite what some might voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| that it is because, in fact, it is a loss of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| that you did have prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I wanted to piggyback on what Commissioner Hill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| I think the huge issue is, and I think it was one of the constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Misty Richards, said that kind of struck me, it's a burden of engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| It seems like developers never want to talk to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| and that's why we're here in this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So if we can just kind of figure out how we can get developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| to talk to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| I know it's hard, but I think that's why we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| and they feel like this is their last resort to use their voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| because no one, it seems like, I don't want to generalize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| it seems like people just don't respect the community voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| And I think that's why we got thousands, I feel like thousands of emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| but I think that's the bigger issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| And I do understand why Commissioner Smith brought the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| because, you know, you do want to shorten the path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| but I just think if we be more responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and I know when I used to come to planning commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| and you get this paper, one of the first guidelines is always say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| reach out to your community, and they don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And that's why we're on this struggle bus right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| So I just wanted to say that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Commissioner Daley and I were the first citizen body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| that was appointed by the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| to serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| because county commissioners, by a judge's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| said they could not serve anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| because we were a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| But the point is, in those six years that I served with Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| we had very few issues relating to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| And, you know, a lot of the times when the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| and the developer got together, it was resolved right there at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| But the other advantage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| if the developer was going to go to the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| he wanted the BZA testimony as part of the official record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| that would go to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| So by opting out of going to the BZA and going directly to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| both sides lose that option to be able to build a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| and then be presented to the court if, in fact, they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| But as I believe, we've had three issues that have gone to court in how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Is that the number I'm remembering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Mr. Snowden, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| I mean, it's been very, maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I mean, it's like we're trying to solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| we're trying to make a solution to a problem that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| We just didn't have them when he and I served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| And so I just, I can't support this resolution where you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| specifically where you're saying the applicant can opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| So let me go back to the beginning where you outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| that it does not currently say in our ordinance today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| that development plans can be appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| So let's say this ordinance, let's say this entire ordinance went away tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| Even though for however many years development plans have been appealed to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| if the next one that came down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| they put in a development plan and somebody filed appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| who would say to the BZA, sorry, it's not in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| You don't have the right to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| That's a very interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| So if this just went away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| then there is nothing in our ordinance that says a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| would ever go to BZA anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| That is correct with the possible exception of those three zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| that Mr. Murphy pointed out that call it a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| So who would tell them that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Because if the action has always been everything is heard, who would say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Probably their legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| But they would be free to ignore that advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| I said their legal counsel would probably tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| But as this body or anybody, they would be free to ignore that advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| If the Board of Zoning Appeals decided, yes, we do, because we always have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| then they'd go ahead and hear it, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| and if the side that was aggrieved didn't like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| they might take that question up on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| What I've told you about our ordinance is statutory interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| It is my opinion of what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| Who is the legal counsel for BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| So that's why it was an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| You know, I'm saying this, and as I've said to Mr. Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| from conversations we had last week, I'm not saying this as an advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| I truly believe this is what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| My job is to advise you as best I can, not to be an advocate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| but to tell you what I think it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| And I would probably tell the Board of Zoning Appeals the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| I'd provide them the same memos I've had, I'd show them the same law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| and if they decided, no, we do have that authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| then they'd hear the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| but that question might then come up in front of a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| and the court ultimately would decide that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| So this ordinance attempts to head that off at the pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| changing it the way that Commissioner Schoonmaker suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| would head it off at the pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| But right now, as I read this ordinance, however it's been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| I do not believe it provides that, in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| the development plans can go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Okay, so if no action, if this goes away, let's say the sponsor drops it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| then this issue is going to come up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| If it stays as it is, it has the potential to address what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| but it probably doesn't go far enough to codify behavior for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| And if it's a substitute motion to add the development plans to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| then it could be amended even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| So there's sort of three paths ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Regardless of this, I just want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Every bit of documentation that's sent to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| and I don't have the bylaws in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| but regardless of this, somebody has got to take up looking at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| We have massive attendance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| We have some appointed members from this commission body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| that has never attended a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| My understanding is five of six have to be there to take any action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and its quorums are of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| Somebody has got to dig into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| and perhaps it's the people that were on BZA to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| how does this function better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Because if we have a citizen body that is making rulings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| on people's ability to do business and they don't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| or they don't have a quorum and they can't act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| then we've got an economic logjam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| regardless if it's one person or a huge developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| So I hope somebody will dive in and figure out how to make it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| or amend the bylaws where a simple majority of people show up or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| We have a motion before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| which is to approve this on first reading as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| I guess I can offer my comments now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| We're probably at a place where, as Commissioner Jay just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| even if no action is taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| let's say this ordinance were withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| or just die for lack of enough votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| and we did not make any change to do what the Planning Alliance folks would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| and codify that BZA is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| My guess is the next development plan that gets appealed to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| and it is an applicant that has the means, it will end up in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| and a court will decide whether or not our development plans are appealable to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| And depending on what that court says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| I guess this body would then be charged with either taking action or not taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| Do you see that path happening, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Well, I mean, if the court agreed with my interpretation of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| then it would result that that would be the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| and unless it's changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| there would not be any opportunity to take development plans to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| So where I am on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| there's a lot of ambiguity on the dice right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| If I'm reading tea leaves, they are just kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| And my heart's all over the place on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I mean, when issues come up like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| my first instinct is I go with people I believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| And, you know, I'm not trying to blow smoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| but I believe in our mayor, and I believe in his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| I think he has a great vision for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I think he has the right ideology for the county that I want to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| I think there's people on both sides of this issue that believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| So unless I'm convinced otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| I tend to want to support the mayor's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| I have met with several folks from the Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| and they have done extensive research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and there's a lot of merit to the things they've pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| There's a lot of inconsistencies and incongruities in our zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| that need to be cleaned up for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| There is an issue on BZA where right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| if something were appealed to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| who knows when it would actually be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| And if a lot of things got appealed, that could be a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| That all being said, my inclination is to support the first reading of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:14| But honestly, I'm unconvinced, and I'm just being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I'm doing what my mayor said to do, which was do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Do what you feel like is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| And I'm unconvinced that this is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Now, somebody's got a month to convince me that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| But right now, I'm looking at something that might be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| if certain things were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| But based on the volume of what's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| I'm seeing a perception by the public that's not good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| for this body to take this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| And that we're not taking action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| We're just moving this on to a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| It's all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| And we obviously could vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| but my inclination is, yeah, we'll move it forward to a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| but somebody's got to convince me in that month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| that this is a necessary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| and that we're not just fighting a ghost that we're afraid might come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| If it does, then we can take action then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| But I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| For now, I'm a soft yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| That's all we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Commissioner David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| We've beat this horse for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| We've got to take some type of action to stay out of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| I'm tired of paying lawyers $400,000, $500,000, a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| So whatever this action is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| whether it be leaving it at BZA or not at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| it's got to be clarified to keep us out of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Aren't we tired of paying lawyers hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| on something that we can decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Give me $480,000 that we spend on the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| I could do a lot in South Knoxville for $480,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And between now and 30 days from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| it's got to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| What that clarification is, we'll know at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| But we've got to clarify to keep us out of paying lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| hundreds of thousands of dollars on something that we can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| I hope that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| The motion before us is to approve this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| as its latest amended form on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| That was by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| I believe the second was by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Correction, it was by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| All in favor of roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Oh, it is a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| We are at a meeting now, not a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| So this is first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Yes, there's been an amendment to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| and so it constitutes a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| It's been substantial in the opinion of the sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=3985)|

| 1:08:37| And I don't know what Mr. Roman's sentiments are regarding that buffer at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=4117)|

| 1:10:09| emerged from the Stakeholder Committee's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=4209)|

| 1:10:39| For this reason, the task force recommended in its approved study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| that new development include a 50-foot tree protection buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-2?start=4243)|
