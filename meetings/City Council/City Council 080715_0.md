| 0:00:12| We would ask everyone to please stand so we can have invocation from Council Member Pelo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=12)|
| 0:00:18| and the pledge from Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=18)|
| 0:00:23| If you will bow your heads, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| Our Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight with hearts heavy as our colleague, Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=26)|
| 0:00:34| Hall, is recovering from a very serious accident and we pray that you will bless and comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=34)|
| 0:00:44| and give strength to the Hall family as they minister to Steve during this time of recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=44)|
| 0:00:53| We pray your blessings for as complete a recovery as possible, as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| We're impatient folks and we hate to see someone we love who is suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| Also, we bring to your attention our attorney, Charles Swanson's wife's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=66)|
| 0:01:15| Pam lost her mother this week and it's been a very difficult week for the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=75)|
| 0:01:22| Our father also has had an accident and is recovering and we just pray your blessings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| on Pam and Charles and their families and on Pam's father as they try to deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| loss of someone they love very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Our Father, we do feel so blessed and we do feel so comforted by knowing that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| our strength, you are our redeemer, and we have some wonderful power to turn to when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=107)|
| 0:01:56| life seems so difficult to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| We pray for all those out there who are citizens of our city and our county, our state, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=120)|
| 0:02:09| nation who are facing many personal problems these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| We pray your blessings upon them and the light of your hope be upon them that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| may find days to be blessing and a challenge with your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| We're grateful for the many things and opportunities that come into our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| We're so grateful for people who are willing to take their time to volunteer that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| lives may be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| We are so grateful for people who give their time and their talents and their interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| that we may hear from them in our public meetings and have the opportunity to take value from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| their ideas and from their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| We pray that you will bless us during this meeting and that may all of our deliberations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| be as you would have us to resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=195)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=207)|

| 0:03:45| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Chair, we'd entertain a motion to approve the minutes of last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=226)|

| 0:03:51| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=231)|

| 0:04:15| We're going to be here a long time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Well, if you'd like, yeah, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Now it's time for the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Obviously, I'm not the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| We wish the mayor a safe and pleasant journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| He is out of town at this time, and I'm sitting here as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| We thank Councilmember Pelo for a prayer for the Hall family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| and for Charles Swanson and his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| And that is it from the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| We ask that you all please continue to keep the Hall family, Swanson family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| and his wife in particular in your prayers and in your kind thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Any reports from councilmembers or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Councilmember Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| As the council's rep to the KTA, that is the Knoxville Transportation Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| I wanted to announce that there will be a public hearing during its meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| not this Thursday but the following Thursday, July 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| at 3 p.m. in the main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| for the purpose of considering public comment both written and oral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| on the proposed list of options for increasing revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| and or decreasing expenses in the Knoxville area transit operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=322)|
| 0:05:32| You are able to submit written comments in advance of that meeting by 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| on Wednesday, July 23rd, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| So I encourage people to attend that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| And as your KTA rep, I guess you can't really talk to me, but you could talk to me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=347)|
| 0:05:58| I am not in favor of reducing services at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| At a time when people want more of CAT, giving people less of CAT doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=364)|
| 0:06:13| So if you would like to say something to me now, you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| or tell Hubert Smith something, and he can tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Councilman Woodhull, with Vice Mayor Brown's permission, I would say something to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I attended the morning session that was held recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| and we were told about the budget difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| and the issues that are facing CAT and that are facing this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| And I guess I just continue to hear loud and clear the desires of the people that these routes not be decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| Maybe efficiencies certainly need to be looked at, because I think that may be an issue that can be managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| And then I have extreme concern about the express routes being either discontinued or in some way diminished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=422)|
| 0:07:17| because I see a great benefit to our city from eliminating those trips from our environmental concerns here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=437)|
| 0:07:29| to our parking concerns and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| And, frankly, there are many people who do not even live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| I'm sure you have all heard from them, I certainly have, don't even live in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and who are absolutely depending upon their transportation, their park and ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| from those locations that the express routes serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| I'm not magic for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| I'm not a big green fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| And I know that there are many issues, but I certainly speak strongly in favor of not reducing the service at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| and particularly at this time, in our nation's economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| And you know that I spoke to Mayor Eddie Ford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| and he very graciously is, with approval of his aldermen, are going to be contributing to the Farragut Express route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=497)|
| 0:08:26| So he considers us a partner in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| I do indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| And Councilman Woodhull, I have to commend you for personally approaching him about that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| and for very successfully persuading him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| I had an earlier conversation in which he did not seem so enthusiastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| But I think once he realized the opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| and the fact that many of these folks are able to live in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| because they have employment in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| and we are able to assist them with many people who live in the city and travel out to Farragut to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| So I think he began to see that it is a two-way trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| And I'm sure I want to thank you for your efforts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Well, actually, I guess I had a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I think it's worthwhile to see if there are other comments about the KTA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| because it is a valuable chance we have to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| I guess I had not heard that Mayor Ford had agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| And I think I want to echo Ms. Pillow's congratulations to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And I might have some people I need you to talk to if you're that good at negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| So we'll use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| And if there are other folks, I've got some other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| but if there are other people who want to comment on transit, we might want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| I would just say let's not get too far afield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| But it's good to get comments right now because it's not officially on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| but we can't have the discussion we're having right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Just keep it very general and it's not geared towards any type of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Councilman Bailey, your light's on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I'd just like to very quickly say I'm glad there's a public meeting because I, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| have heard a number of people questioning this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And at a time when you have rising fuel costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| and people are looking for alternative methods to get around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| this is an opportunity for people to use public transportation, which we spend a lot of money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| So I brought up the question to Hubert, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| why at this time wouldn't you try to put some more emphasis on marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| and get people on a bus and to see how the system works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| And I look at it as an opportunity, so I look forward to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| I want to thank you all for your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| and Councilman Woodhull for negotiating that with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Working with Mayor Ford and the Board of Aldermen, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| It's an important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Along those lines, Councilman Bailey and I are co-chairing the Transportation Mobility Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| that several members, Councilman Woodhull serves on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| P. Lowe serves on, Councilman, or excuse me, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| although I think he indicated he's probably going to appoint someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| And we are going to try to do our part in addressing those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| But that's more of a longer term thing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| So this hearing is really appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I did want to point out that the Transportation Mobility Committee is having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| technically it's its second meeting, but in some ways it's really kind of its first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| because we all agreed at the first meeting that we needed to have a kickoff effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| that was facilitated by leadership in Knoxville, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| And that's happening this coming Monday, the 21st, from 7.30 a.m. to 1 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| So I just wanted to remind all Council members that that's happening and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Of course, if anyone from the public wants to come, they're welcome to come and observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| Location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And thank you, United Way of Knoxville, or greater Knoxville, on Hannah Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| And, actually, you've mentioned, the name's been mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| I have talked to Mr. Smith, Hubert Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| He's agreed to accept my appointment to that committee, so he will be in attendance with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Someone mentioned Hubert Smith earlier, and you were talking about my appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Actually, I'll be appointing him to my slot on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Wonderful, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Great appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| And I'm looking forward to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Now let's go back to the sequence, and I think next would actually be Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Three quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| One, my e-mail has been down for about a week, so I want to apologize to anybody who's wondering why I haven't responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| Right now I have an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Next week I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| And if I've missed it, I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Second, I just want to point out that next Tuesday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| and this is actually, I guess, more with Mr. Frost's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| but there's another public hearing on the downtown north going to be next Tuesday, the 22nd, at 530 at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| That's moving forward well, and a good crowd there a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| And then finally, before the next Council meeting on the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| there's going to be a meeting of the Audit Committee at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| This is going to be, I think, a valuable meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Partly we're going to set a schedule for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| but mostly we're going to be getting a briefing on a bond issue that we're going to be considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| at that Council meeting later that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| So if other members of Council want to attend to get a better picture of what we're doing, you're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| It's going to be at 6 o'clock up in the war room on the fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Before I make the announcement I'm going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| I just wanted to go back to the comments that Council Member Woodhull had made, if it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| I think we need to say a thank you to the Town of Farragut for their willingness to partner with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| This is a new opportunity for them, a new experience for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| and I trust that it's going to be a very good experience in which we'll want to continue our relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| and hopefully they will feel they want to even contribute more than was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| So I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Now, I'll go to an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| I'm going to invite you all to a party, to a picnic next Monday, the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| and it is in West Hills Park and it will be the West Hills Community Association Summer Picnic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| And, Joe, I have 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Do I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I thought that sounded pretty late for old folks like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| 6.15 at West Hills Park on Monday, the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| And come and bring a dish if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| But if not, just come bring yourself and we will look forward to seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| I think the folks from the zoo are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| With Vice Mayor Brown's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Yes, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| A clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Alex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| 6.15 would be the check-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| The zoo comes shortly thereafter, bringing some animals for young and old to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And after about a half hour of that presentation, then there will be food available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Everyone is certainly welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Is there another light, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Unfortunately, yes, thank God there are people watching me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| because the Audit Committee meeting next week is actually not in the War Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| It's in the City Council Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| So it's down the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Seeing no further lights of Council, I would just join in and say I appreciate the comments from Councilmember Woodhull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| and others regarding CAT and that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And I ask that those in attendance here, as well as those at home, please plan to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| That's a very important discussion, very important issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| and I, too, have deep concerns about proposed cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| Now, Madam, recorded to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Item 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointments of William E. Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| and Owen Blackman McBride to serve as members of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Madam, recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Article V, Section 10, signs, billboards, and other advertising structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| and related to the operating regulations of electronic message centers in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Before a motion is made, as is our practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| there are a couple of individuals who have signed up to speak to this particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| And with Council's permission, we'll allow them to speak prior to our discussion or motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| as we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| I have here, but there's no indication whether they're for or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| Joyce Feld, DeWayne Greese, and also David Buckwalter, who is also against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| So those in favor have an opportunity to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| And is Ms. Joyce Feld here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| It's hard to say whether I'm in favor or opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| The time is 718.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Just give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| You have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| First, I would, again, encourage you to send this issue back to MPC with a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| that it come back with an option to vote for new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Not only are electronic message centers a highly intrusive form of visual pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| and a possible safety hazard as well, and the empirical evidence on this point is mounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| I simply do not have confidence in the city's ability to properly regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| For example, we have hundreds of illegal signs now on our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| some of which have been up for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Why isn't the city doing anything about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| We are already stuck with EMCs which were improperly permitted under a much simpler ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| Several EMCs were permitted by adding together frontage on more than one street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| to meet the 200-foot frontage requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| even though it was clear that the intention of the ordinance was for all 200 feet to be on one street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| In addition, although I appreciate the hours that Ms. Cash must have put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| in order to come up with enforceable illumination controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| this is obviously a lot more technical than the simple language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| 200 linear feet of frontage on a street is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| and thus open to many more oversight and monitoring problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Again, who will monitor this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| How will it be monitored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| And what will the consequences be for noncompliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I reported a business with several on-premise illegal signs a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| They were eventually removed, and a few weeks later, they were all back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| What are the consequences for this blatant disregard of city law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Do we believe that all sign owners will comply with these brightness regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Does the city have sufficient trained staff in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| who we know will diligently and responsibly enforce the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| For those EMCs that are currently in existence legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I would again ask you to consider the following changes to the proposed amendments before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| First, extend the hold time from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Extend the new ordinance to government-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| If the Council is concerned about having the use of these signs in an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| a clause which would allow the city to do this can be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| There should be a limit on the brightness and number of colors that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Preferably, a sign should be allowed to use only one color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and the hue of that color should be subdued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| An EMC should be limited to a maximum of 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Currently, under the current proposed amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| it's allowed a maximum of 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| To a large extent, these decisions come down to how we want our community to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| I believe that the majority of our citizens do not want these digital signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| just as they didn't want digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| People want to live in a place that preserves its scenic beauty, its history, and its culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| and tourists want to visit places that have these qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| We only have to note the success of the revitalization of our downtown and Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| to understand the appeal of places that have a uniqueness of place and a sense of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| places that don't look like anywhere USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Local businesses have more to gain by keeping residents in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| rather than watch them migrate to towns like Farragut, a town without EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| and ensuring that we have a city that attracts tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| than they do by being able to out-advertise each other on ugly and intrusive signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| The desires of the community and the economic well-being of our city are tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| We all want a Knoxville that we are proud to live and work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Duane Greve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| Time is 7.22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Mr. Greve, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Give us your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Duane Greve, number eight Emory Place here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| and I'm not going to go into a great detail about Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| since all of us or you and I especially have had a number of discussions about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| I do want to say on behalf of Scenic Knoxville that we want to thank you for the bold step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| that you took with the billboard situation, and we applaud that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| We hope that that same effort you'll take in looking at EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| Scenic Knoxville would like to go on record saying that we would like to ban EMCs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Therefore, though, we would like to also say that the regulations that are before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| that those be used for the existing signs that would be grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| with a few changes that we would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| One would be that the, as Ms. Fells mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| changing the hold time from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| The other thing that we would like for you to consider is do we really want EMCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Have you folks had an opportunity, have you had enough time to really debate the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| in terms of EMCs in the city, just like the situation with billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| We'd like you to really consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| As I said, Scenic Knoxville would prefer no more EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| The other thing is that we're very much concerned about how you regulate the ordinance that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| Last night it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| I drove down Kingston Pike and just in a very short distance I noticed two signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| that had been erected since the existing ordinance was in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| and it's my understanding that those two signs in particular do not meet the existing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| nor would they meet the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And you can go and look at the ORNL credit union sign as well as Goodwill Industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| and see the situation that you have at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Those signs, it was my understanding, were erected illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| and they're still flashing as you go down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| So I'd ask that you take a look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| The other issue, very quickly, would like to ask that if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| you're going to go ahead and pass the existing ordinance that's in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| is that you waive the waiting time of the 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| That if we go ahead and approve the ordinance, that you go ahead and say that you waive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| so that we can immediately begin to count the 90 days that the ordinance will take effect on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| So, again, I want to thank you for the work that you did with the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| and we hope that that will continue with the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Next is David Buckwalter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| The time is 725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| David Buckwalter, 813 Maplehurst Court, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| And I've kind of surprised myself on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I'm instinctively opposed to certainly digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and even the smaller ones I have a lot of concerns about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| But as I considered the ordinance and the amendments that I know you've worked hard on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and others have worked hard on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| I found myself beginning to see the possibility for using this technology strictly as a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1519)|
| 0:25:29| for the old card type with the suction cup on the end of the stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| And like others who have spoken, I have a lot of concerns about regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| But in light of that, I'm going to say that I can see a way that maybe these could be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| and I'll have to say the old signs, the old style, are not terribly attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| and are often letters missing and just kind of shabby looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| So I think it's worth considering whether or not it's possible to use these in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| that contributes more to the city than it takes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| And while my instinctive preference is still to prohibit these electronic signs altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| I do appreciate and respect council's efforts to look at how to effectively regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| this powerful new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| So long as the ordinance strictly limits their function as reasonable modern replacements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| for the old suction cup on the end of the stick system, which, as I said, are unsightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| I believe the automatic light sensing and dimming system you specified in the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| is a reasonable approach to controlling the brightness, which is a key issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Like a thermostat automatically adjusts to changing temperature conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| these built-in lumistats, as we might call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| would automatically adjust to changing light conditions to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| and maintain an acceptable level of brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| One big problem I do have with the ordinance, and I would go even farther than others who have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| as written and amended is allowing the EMCs to change every ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| This is clearly not in keeping with the purpose and function of the old message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Except for recent gas prices, I doubt the old message boards are changed more frequently than every day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| Every time an EMC changes, it draws additional attention and creates distractions for drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| I strongly suspect that the EMCs' appeal to businesses is as much or more in their ability to draw attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| as in their ability to convey specific messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| In keeping with limiting their function only as replacements for the old message boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| the new EMCs should not be allowed to change more frequently than once every 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| After all, you have wisely called them electronic message boards, not electronic attractor boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| A 15-minute interval reduces driver distractions to 1 90th as often as with a 10-second interval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| At the same time, the 15-minute interval increases businesses' ability to easily and frequently change their message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| up to 96 times a day, considering that the old technology is rarely changed more than once a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| A 15-minute rate change is a huge advance for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| A 15-minute interval seems the reasonable balance point between the interests of public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| not to mention public sanity, and the interests businesses have to more easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| and more frequently change their message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Even with the best of regulations, in the end, they're only as good as the ability to enforce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| After all, the dimmer and timing settings are in the hands of business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| and there will be a strong desire and incentive to use them as attention attractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| and creep in the direction of brighter levels and faster change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Therefore, enforcement is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Ideally, one business on a commercial strip would notice a competitor's display seems a bit brighter than it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| or the rate of change is more frequent than allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Ideally, she calls the city and this is promptly addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| If not promptly addressed, the natural inclination would be to simply adjust her own display a little brighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| or a little faster, and in a short time, the regulations break down completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| I am truly skeptical that the city has the ability to adequately enforce this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and keep it within reasonable boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Many of these ECMs are effectively large television screens and much, much more powerful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| and temptingly useful to businesses than functioning simply as message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| I might be more inclined to trust the city's ability to regulate and enforce them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| if it did a better job of regulating something as simple as the timing of the countdown features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| on the crosswalk signals right out here on Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| You have one more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Right in front of this building and on other pedestrian streets and over which the city has complete control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| I propose that you consider amending the change time to 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and added an indefinite or at least extended moratorium on any new ECMs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| since the existing ones are to be in compliance within three months of passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| That gives time to see how the city does with regulating the limited number we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| before letting this cat any farther out of the bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| In conclusion, my instinct is that it is better to simply ban the ECMs altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| but with the exception of the 10-second change rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| this ordinance does appear to conceive and limit them to functioning as modern versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| of the old ubiquitous cardboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| If function, timing, and brightness could be properly regulated and enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| I will concede they could actually be an improvement for all concerned over the old bedraggled card systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| The real questions remain, is Knoxville up to the challenges this technology brings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| If we proceed very carefully and slowly, we might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Let's ban them altogether or at least give ourselves the best chance to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| That brings to a close those folks who have signed up for this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| A discussion of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Yes, Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| This might be a question for Mrs. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| You're the one who prepared what's on the front of the information, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| Yes, and I have some copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| I put this all together so everybody could see it, so I'm going to pass out copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| rather than just that one page, if you all would like to see it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| While you're passing that out, you don't need to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I'll just say the last line, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| it is the responsibility of the sign owner to demonstrate compliance with brightness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| intensity, and dimming settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I was wondering if it would be prudent to maybe add a time frame within which compliance must be demonstrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| because as it stands right now, it's wholly open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| Sure, you can add anything you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Well, I mean, I don't want someone to say there is no time frame, I'll get around to it in a couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| but in the meantime, their sign is bright enough to land airplanes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| I mean, 72 hours reasonable time for notification by a city official for someone to demonstrate compliance, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1916)|
| 0:32:06| The way I see this working is we receive a complaint, we notify the people where the sign is that we've received a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| They are required to submit proof to us that they are in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| If they cannot submit that proof, then I would think, yes, sir, 72 hours would be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| Since it's my understanding, these changes can be made with the stroke of some keys on a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| I mean, I'm just trying to find something that's, you can't necessarily expect someone to jump at the drop of a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| Some reasonable time frame that someone could be given in order to demonstrate their compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| I mean, I'll make that motion later on, because I'm sure other folks want to discuss what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I agree with a lot of what the speakers said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| I don't necessarily, I mean, folks know how I felt about digital billboards and didn't support them when I owed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| I'm not a fan of these electronic message centers either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| I think some of them, for what seemed to be a rather innocuous use of, this doesn't apply to all, have been perverted a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1985)|
| 0:33:15| And I think they have become grossly inappropriate in some circumstances in how they're being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| Council Member Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I guess I've got a question either for Ms. Cash or Mr. King about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| And it sort of goes to what Councilman Frost was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| But in general, you know, we've had some challenges enforcing the current ordinance, which seems a little simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| We've had, I thought it was interesting, Mr. King, that Mr. Buchwalter talked about the crosswalk signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| which we can't seem to get the timing right on those, and we own them and control them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| How are we going to go out and regulate the potentially hundreds of these signs effectively to make sure that people are following the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| Because I think Mr. Buchwalter has a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| When one sign gets out of compliance, if it's not fixed, that's an encouragement for every other sign to get out of compliance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| So fill me in on what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| As most of you know, I think all of you know, we currently have one sign inspector that has been hired by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| as a result of a study committee in 1986 when these original regulations were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| For many years, we did not have any control over EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| We had nothing to prohibit them, and we had no regulatory standards at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| A number of years ago, I believe it was 2002, there was a study committee put together that made some, the first stab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2082)|
| 0:34:52| We've tried to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| We found out that those regulations are not strict enough, nor are they tight enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And so that is what has actually led us to today is to tighten up some on the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| We have one sign inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| We have five building and zoning inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| The zoning regulations are where the sign regulations are held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| It would be my opinion and only my opinion that in addition to myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| and the sign inspector that those building inspectors could enforce those provisions of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| But I'll defer to Mr. King to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Well, I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I also would compare this to what we did a few years ago in engineering with our as-built program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| We don't have the staff to inspect and determine that every development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| detention pond or stormwater drainage system is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| So we went to a system where the developer or owner does the surveying and as-built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| And a private individual certifies that it's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I think what's proposed here is that the owners of these EMCs would have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2166)|
| 0:36:16| when requested to provide the documentation that the light is appropriate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| the dimming and the hold time and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So that's one way that we would assure compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| And then we would not have to have as many people as we might have if we're going to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and, you know, test the lights, you know, whether it's too bright or too dim at certain times of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| And with the follow-up, the as-built, I mean, one, it's a licensed professional doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| So they, if they made a mistake, they have a threat of losing a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| We have a bond on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| There's a lot of controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| What on the as-builts, on the detention ponds, there's nothing similar on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| I mean, are we asking folks to bond these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Are we asking any kind of similar enforcement mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Because it's actually not a bad idea, and it does seem to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| But I don't see the same teeth in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I'm not sure what the need might be better suited to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| The penalty is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| The penalty is regulated by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| If you are in violation, you run the risk of being issued a citation to city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| By state law, that fine is set at $50 plus court costs if you are found guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| and if the fine is levied against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| There has been some new rulings that once you go to court and you are found guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| the judge can give you time to get in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| And if you are not in compliance when your case goes back to court, you can be fined $50 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| Otherwise, you must be cited every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| But that maximum fine is regulated by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| And if many of you will remember, there was a provision, an amendment on the ballot a number of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| to change that law and allow municipalities to set their own penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| and that was not approved by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| It's not my turn, but it's a follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I think it's going to lose its content if we have a couple of other discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| Let me ask you, I think KUB must do something very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| We just got a letter about three weeks ago that we had a problem with our water meter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2316)|
| 0:38:45| It was our responsibility to hire someone to come and see what our problem was, and we had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| We had to hire a licensed contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Then we had to submit to KUB, a report, to indicate that that problem had been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| I mean, in all the years I've lived in Knoxville, that had never come up for us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| but that sounds like a similar thing to the As-Built issue and how you handle that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| when you don't have enough inspectors to do the inspecting and correcting yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Would that be a similar type of remedy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| I'm not familiar with exactly what you're talking about with KUB, but I think it is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| But it worked that it was our responsibility to get the problem corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| and that to not do so, there would be a punitive situation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| So, of course, we obtained someone to do that, and they took care of it right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| and apparently do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| And then that report went to KUB, and that was actually the basis for proving that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| It appears to me that something of that nature, which sounds something like what you do with the As-Built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| might be something to consider here with a kind of a drought with inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2400)|
| 0:40:10| Council Member Holquist, and I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Ms. Cash, do you have any idea how many EMCs are out there right now in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| Any just rough idea even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| You may not, but I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| You may not have to know, but I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Actually, in 2002, I did a survey of the city, the entire city, and had them all down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2429)|
| 0:40:38| Believe it or not, there are less than 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| There are a few more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Well, yeah, and over time there will be a lot more if we continue to allow them under any sort of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| The problems we're describing compound with the number of EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and obviously we can't go back and say EMCs that already exist can no longer exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| because they're protected under the state grandfather statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| But it just seems to me like it's hard for me to figure out what the true value to this community is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| of having proliferation of EMCs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| I mean, I drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I try not to do it very much, but occasionally I drive through Sevierville and Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| and that's all it takes to convince me that this is not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| And so it seems to me like if we could figure out how to approach this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| maybe the best way would be to ban all new EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| and enact some version of what's before us to regulate the existing EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| and just not allow any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Not allowing digital billboards because we realize they create a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| I don't see this as being dramatically different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| And I'm not asking you to respond, Cash, because I'm just at this point, I'm making a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| throwing this out for discussion to the rest of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| but I can see some fairly strict regulations that are easy to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| or not easy to enforce, easier than some others might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| You know, try to fine tune these as best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| but then just not allow any more EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| That may be the solution here, and that's certainly the way I'd like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I agree with Councilman Holquist and a number of other comments that have been given earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| However, I do want to raise a concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| And I wanted to ask a question or two to some of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| or members of the audience who served on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| and I cannot remember the exact name of the study committee for the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| I know Councilman Roddy and Councilman Pelo served on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Was there any discussion or consideration given to larger developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2578)|
| 0:43:07| or, you know, over 50 acres or over 100 acres or over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| because Mr. Burkhalter, Walter, earlier was talking about possible replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| of some type of digital billboard over and reducing the number of the old ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| because there aren't any attractive billboards, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| but I think some of these older ones around here are just absolutely awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| But was there any consideration given to the larger developments where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| for instance, you may have less billboards, digital billboard, EMC, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| in lieu of numerous signage on buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Let me jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| I don't think Turkey Creek allows EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Not within the development, because they have a signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| However, they're situated on interstate where they have other parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2643)|
| 0:44:13| which do not have the opportunity to have the same advertising and the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| And I guess you'd call that off-premise, am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| That part of Turkey Creek is covered under the master signage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and they could have one EMC if the developer would allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| but I do not believe that he allows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Well, that's kind of where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Was there any discussion about this in the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Because we were just dealing with, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| We discussed regulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| At the time the committee was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| there was not a minimum nor a maximum size restriction for any EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| And actually what brought it all about, Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| was there was a gentleman driving up and down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| selling EMCs out of the back of his car that were about that big and about that tall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| and they all went up on Kingston Pike, and we got overrun with complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| That's what started the original committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| That's why there's the minimum size of 20 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| and the committee determined that they wanted a maximum size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| That's why for a wall sign it's 100 square feet maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| but for a ground sign it's a third of your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| Well, we have a moratorium in place now until I think September the 15th, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| And Councilman Hulk was down the lines of your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| You know, as we move along here, I'd like to see more of a movement towards a ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| and to figure out and tweak these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| And I'd also, I'd like to hear some discussion at some point among interested parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| and council members on large developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| and the potential there or lack of, you know, possibilities for signings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| I think it's telling, I don't want to go out of term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| but it's telling that Turkey Creek won't allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| That says a lot right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| I think it says a lot that Turkey Creek won't allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| But they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| They could, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| But they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| And I think this is something that ought to be looked at and discussed and addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| But I have to tell you that when Turkey Creek made some decisions that were, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| hard decisions for them at the time because there were some other issues with some properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| that fronted on other connectors, major connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I think they made the decision to protect the interior of their development with a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| However, that master signage plan was not going to influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| or affect those properties which faced on other frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| So I happen, that is in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I happen to be very involved in those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and particularly involved in stressing the importance, I thought, of a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Now, I think they have other issues which have never really had the opportunity to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| by this council or brought to this council by Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| I have no idea what those may be, but I know that those were left hanging at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| I'll just briefly elaborate on something Councilman Bailey said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| The moratorium is apparently in effect until September 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| If I'm wrong, Mr. Swanson, please correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| But the key is or until council passes this under final consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Therefore, if this council wants to consider the potential ban of these things going forward in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| if we act tonight, that means there is no ban in effect that tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| someone could come in, many someones could come in and start applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| So I would submit that if we're going to talk about the possibility of banning it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| that this needs to be postponed until a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Otherwise, if it's voted upon tonight one way or the other, the moratorium is ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| I think that's helpful information for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| I guess there's a little sort of process concern I've got in that we decided with this committee back in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| to allow EMCs and to regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| In my sense, that was a good eight-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| People got together, talked about it, considered a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| This has come up as sort of a sidelight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| When MPC was doing the billboard ordinance, they said, oh, we can fit electric EMCs a little better into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| Our codes department said we've got to tinker with a little bit to tighten it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| And this has not had that really good public vetting that we had several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| So if we are going to consider a ban, I think we need to start that process and do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| I mean, I would, you know, it feels like we've talked about it for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| and if people feel strongly about it, we ought to get started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| Because there are business people who were, you know, legitimately moving forward a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| maybe when this moratorium started, that we've delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| And originally we delayed them for 60 days and extended and extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| So I'm a little concerned that we, you know, fish or cut bait on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| So I just urge folks to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Before I go to Council Member Holquist, are there any other questions for Ms. Cash so she can sit down if she needs to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| If you have anything that you want to say, you've been standing for a good while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| I just have two little corrections that need to be made on the document that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| On page three and under number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| The one you just handed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| On page three under item number 12, down in the last line, it says no dynamic display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| That needs to be changed to electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| And then on the last page in item number K, on the last line, it talks about dynamic display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| And that also needs to be changed to electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| Where was the second one again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| K on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| K on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Well, Council Member Becker, I think I understand your concerns about making sure that we have adequate process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| and that it happened on a timely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| And I don't disagree with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| But I think this body has the authority to undertake such an action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and we don't necessarily have to take six or eight months to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| I think we can move ahead, as you indicated we need to, on a reasonable basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| and perhaps even take action in a comprehensive way prior to the expiration of the current moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3080)|
| 0:51:29| We can certainly extend the moratorium should we need to do that, but that may not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| We may want to have an additional workshop, something that allows folks to really have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| I think I heard you say something about business people who have had their plans on hold, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| I hear what you're saying, but these are signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| For the most part, businesses are not, it's not a live or die situation for a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| as to whether or not they have an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| That would be my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| I could be wrong, but I think most businesses that have pondered having EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| were working towards having EMCs, if there are such out there and were put on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| are continuing the operation of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| And probably there are a lot of other factors at play in the economy, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| that are having a whole lot more impact on them than whether or not they had an EMC functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| I'd like to make a motion to postpone what's in front of us tonight for six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| to allow this council time to schedule a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| I'm not sure that we need to call another study committee, and I guess I need to refer to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| If this council would decide within the context of a workshop and hearing from the public on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| that they would like to move forward with a ban on new electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| understanding that the currently existing ones are grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| that cannot initiate out of a workshop, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| That has to come through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| So I'm thinking in terms of because passing this ordinance hits go on the new signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| under the terms of our moratorium, how much time we would need on a postponement of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| if some of those options were to be considered in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| It would be my opinion that if you postpone this for six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| and during that six-week period what you ultimately decide to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| either through a workshop or through whatever process you utilize to make decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| if what you decide that you want to do is ban any future EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| then I think that's going to have to go back through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| because I don't think that's something that the minutes would reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| that the Metropolitan Planning Commission considered in this original process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| They were considering the regulation and not the ban of EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| And so because it is a zoning ordinance or related to a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| as provided under the Cherokee Country Club case, then it's got to go through MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Now, having said that, you could start that process six weeks down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| send it to MPC for consideration of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and probably then you would have to extend your moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| in order for it to get done on a timely basis, which is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| You just have to make sure you pay attention to your dates and do it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Two things occurred to me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| The first one is I certainly don't wish to curtail debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| on the ordinance that's in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| However, if regulating the existing signs that we have is intimately related to the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| of whether or not we want any new signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| it would seem prudent to roll all of that into a workshop discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| rather than continuing to discuss the various amendments to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| if it needs to be postponed anyway to allow us more time to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| whether or not a ban is something that we would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| I guess, secondly, I would like to propose a postponement that is short enough in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| that we can go ahead and get that workshop scheduled and get that out in the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| and then if it does need to be referred back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| that in light of folks who are waiting to hear what this decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| this is moving forward on a timely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| I feel like four weeks probably isn't sufficient perhaps to get in the queue for a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| although I don't know that we have any coming up right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| so that's why I suggested six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Four would be preferable, but I'm going to move to postpone this in front of us for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Now I'm going to follow the series of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I see your lights off now, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| On the motion, next in line would have been Councilmember Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3348)|
| 0:56:04| Well, unfortunately, my comment was to a response to Councilman Hawkins' statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| and it is not, well, perhaps it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| I'll relate it to the motion somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Because I just want it to be understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| One of my concerns about delaying this and stretching it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| and Councilman Hawkins made the comment that, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| this was not going to, you know, prevent someone from doing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| and I don't disagree with that really, but there is a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| and it has sort of been toyed with in the past when we've discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| We're an individual in particular, and I have no reason to advocate for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| but he certainly has my telephone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| But he has called me repeatedly, and perhaps you all have heard from him as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| because, unfortunately, or the way things worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| he applied for a permit just immediately the day after we, well, basically after we, you know, placed the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3420)|
| 0:57:12| And, you know, wisdom isn't always, you know, the best indicator of people's intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| but he did not, unfortunately, the sign had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| The sign is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| The sign is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| It has been there since last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| So, you know, it's just one of those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| and I do think that there are people who are waiting for us to resolve this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| which we've been, you know, muddling since last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| So that was the only comment I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Mr. Swanson, help me with this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Is it possible to postpone the final action on this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| and likewise refer it back to MPC for consideration at their August meeting for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| taking into account we appreciate the work that they've done thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| but for their August meeting to consider the ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| would that help shorten the time frame that people are concerned about and maybe find resolution sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| In my view, you can do either of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| You can refer it back to MPC and give instruction to MPC why you're referring it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| what you want them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| But if you do that, then you're not postponing for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| You're just referring back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| and they'll get it back to you consistent with their own schedule rather than necessarily in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| I'm certain their July agenda is already set, but August is still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Am I correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| The July meeting has passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| and we have the luxury of having five weeks between meetings this particular month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| so we still have time for the August deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| I mean, what I'm saying is you can either refer it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| or you can postpone it six weeks, but I don't think you can do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| It's just my concern that if it's going to be postponed six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| that it might eventually get back, get referred back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| maybe go ahead and cut to the chase and consider giving it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| That's a policy issue for you folks to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Well, my concerns are along similar lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| And, Councilman Roddy, I'm not necessarily opposed to Councilman Roddy's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| or her motion to postpone, but I would like to make sure we think through the alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| If we were to send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| the disadvantage is would we have had the opportunity to suggest to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| all the things we'd like for them to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| which we can do with your proposed postponement or your motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Now, in terms of regulating the existing ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| I mean, it would be easy to send it back and say consider a ban on new MCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| but regulating the existing ones, do we want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| how deeply do we want to go into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| And I'm sitting here thinking I'd like to have them consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| or consider longer dwell times or whatever the term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| I'm a little torn on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| You know, I hear what you're saying, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| I was thinking a similar thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| That would be one way to expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| But just kind of throwing that out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| can we cover all the things that we might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| can we think of all those things tonight and ask them to consider them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| And I don't know that we can, because if we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| we should probably just postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| If we could think of all the key issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| and say consider one hour sequences or dwell times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| or whatever the term is, you know, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| and if they consider that, then we can always go to a lesser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| that or a lesser time as long as they've considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Just throwing that out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| I guess my light's gone on and off a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| because I think actually the idea of a workshop is key to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| where we get a chance to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| The interesting part sort of, Mr. Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| the idea that MPC just needs to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| We don't actually have to ask them to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| If we did the workshop before the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| somebody could just stand up and say this is what City Council wants you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| and as long as they thought about it, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| as long as they considered it, we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I mean, you know, we don't have to ask them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| So that would speed the process up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| The key, I think, is can we get a workshop at such and such a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| And, you know, traditionally we tend to poll after meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| Mr. Swanson has bright eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Could I just respond to that just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| I don't think it's going to be sufficient for somebody to stand up in an MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| and say think about this and then some response be given to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| I think you're going to have to have a vetting by the professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| You're going to have to have something on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| You're going to have to have a vetting by the professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| You're going to have to have consideration by the appointed body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| and then some decision one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Just simply standing up in the meeting and saying what about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| and getting some reaction from the assembled members won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| If the MPC members make a motion or say we want to consider a ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| then MPC hasn't considered it because the staff didn't think about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| I think that's a significant portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| because that's why the statute is created to have regional planning commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| because they have professional planning staff to assist the appointed members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| of that regional planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| And I would be fearful that a court would say that just simply an ad hoc consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| by the appointed members of the body at some suggestion in an open meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| would be insufficient consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| And as she gets ready, I'll just put out to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| we're getting real close to the debate in the round now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| saying the same things over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| So maybe we can talk about the motion a little bit or kind of what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| I guess what I'm considering is amending my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Mr. Councilman Hultquist mentioned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| would we be able to consider everything tonight that we needed to refer back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| in regards to the ordinance that's in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| And it's my understanding that we can amend what's in front of us tonight pretty much any way we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| because it's been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| The only thing that we can't do because it hasn't been considered by MPC is a ban of new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| So I'm wondering if it would be more efficient to amend my motion to ask for a six-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| and a referral of the item of a ban of electronic messaging centers back to MPC all in one fell swoop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| so that we can consider it in a workshop during that time, but then it also gets the process started with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Can I do both of those at once, Mr. Swan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| Again, I think if you refer this back to MPC with whatever suggestion you may make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| what you've really done is surrender control of the subject to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| and then you await whatever they come back with with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Can I stand by my original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Also, let me point out that I don't think, Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| that if we refer it back to MPC while the time frame may take longer than six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| this Council still has the power to have a workshop to continue discussing this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| without MPC doing their thing to get our thoughts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| Yes, I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| We just will not be able to maybe have it back in six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| but we can still have our workshop and have our discussion while MPC is vetting and considering the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Mr. Swanson, being the expert on Robert Shultz's order and parliamentary procedure that you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3918)|
| 1:05:27| what takes precedence, a motion to postpone or a motion to refer back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| A motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| I thought so, but I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Seeing no further likes, the actual motion that's on the table currently is a motion to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| Any further discussion of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| And to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| And to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| And to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Councilmember Bailey, on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| And we have an opening on the 7th for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| I am not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| We'll have to check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I'm not sure, to be very honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| We coordinate that with Susan, and I can find out the first thing in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| I'm just not sure, to be very honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| So the motion on the floor is to postpone for six weeks and refer it to a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| hopefully to occur in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| All those in favor of the motion, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Hearing those nos, motion is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| 9B is an ordinance to close a portion of B Drive north of South North Shore Drive with the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| North Shore Commons, LLC, Applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Mr. Chairman, I have been requested to make a motion to refer this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4004)|
| 1:06:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Seeing no lights, all in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Those opposed have likewise right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| 10A is an appeal by Mark D. Harmon of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| to reduce the Canterbury Drive front yard setback from 25 feet to 6 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Article 4, Section 2A.D.1.A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| as per site plan to construct a dwelling on a substandard lot of record in an R1A low-density residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| property located at 2748 Gaston Avenue, in conjunction with Resolution 11K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Mark D. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Before we hear a motion, we actually have an individual here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| Mr. Harmon, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| The time is 8.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Mark Harmon, 1714 North Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| I'm also the County Commissioner for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| But I think probably the best thing to get everybody understanding what's going on here is to share information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| So what I'm going to do is share with you some photos of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| and some correspondence, e-mail correspondence from a LISTSERV, where the community responded to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| So let me just send these about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| And while these are going, if you can hand them out and then kind of go back to the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| so we can make sure we get the recording of your comments, that would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| And while these are going from hand to hand, let me tell you a little bit of what you are seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| On the picture side, you are looking at some neighborhood properties, 2737 Gaston, 2733 Gaston, 2303 Canterbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4111)|
| 1:08:41| directly across the street, directly across in the other direction, 2800 Gaston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| And as you see them, you will see that all of these properties are very well removed from the streets in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| They are not as close as, not anywhere near as close as the six-foot variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| You will also see referenced the home on Carson immediately behind the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| because a false statement was made during the City Board of Zoning Appeals that this one is about six feet off from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| Actually, you can see my measurement, and the property is 14 feet, 8 inches from the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| and 11 feet almost exactly from the air conditioning unit on the side of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| So if we all can see it, you can also read what the community said on North Hills Neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| which is a Yahoo group serving more than 150 persons in the area, received a lot of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| They actually participated in an online poll, and nearly all the respondents either didn't want any variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| or they were willing to go back to something like 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| And let me tell you that there's a reason here to be optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| For reason, compromise, and no confrontation, no adversarial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| What happened was we had this first happen, first came before City BZA late in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| The parties involved were asked to go back and see if we could work out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| I received a phone message from the developer, Ann Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| Unfortunately, I was away in New Orleans at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| This was two hours before the next City BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| where she suggested she could live with a 12-foot variance rather than a 6-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Unfortunately, when this came up at the second City Board of Zoning Appeals, I was, again, unable to be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Standing at my side was Commissioner Mark Campin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| and he unfortunately was not ready for a whole bunch of irrelevant and other distractor issues that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| So instead, we got this thing passed, and it shouldn't have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| And I think if we were treated to the original reasoned compromise, we all can live with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| I've also brought along a member of the community, Melody Reeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| who would also like to support, say in support of a 12-foot or other reasoned compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| rather than the very tight 6-foot variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Please give us your name and address. The time is 811. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| Melody Reeves, 2921 Kenilworth Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| It's about three and a half blocks from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| And I just want to point out that a 12-foot change in the variance is a considerable compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| for us to make in the neighborhood already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| And it's more of a compromise than I would like to see, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| because neighborhoods of this character in the inner city are irreplaceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| They're built once, and they'll never be built again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| And so preserving the vitality of these neighborhoods is really vital to the health of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| and all the related inner city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| So we're trying to maintain the quality of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| and we think that it's the responsibility of developers to know in advance what the ordinances are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| and to plan for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| It's not our responsibility to compromise the cultural and aesthetic quality of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| So we'd like to protect that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Council Member Frost, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I'd just like to wrap up by pointing out that you also have photos that show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| what this area looks like with the 6-foot variance, very tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| the 12-foot compromise, and the 25-foot requirement within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| And that will help you make, I think, the reason to compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| and come to the reason to compromise that we think the neighborhood is presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| So, again, we don't want to be adversarial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| We don't want to be confrontational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| But we believe that returning to this original compromise offer is the best for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| It may mean that a developer might have to change a design element here or there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| but there's plenty of room on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| So as long as you don't stick to a standard thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| you're just going to plop down and say, live with it, neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| Our neighborhood shouldn't be treated like that, and we hope you'll agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Yes, just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Is anyone here against the 12-foot compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| Your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Please come forward, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| And I assume Mr. Harmon and Ms. Reeves were speaking in favor of the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| so you would have, if so choose, a rebuttal period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| Yes, ma'am, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| The time is 8-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Yes, my name is Ann Jernigan, 9740 Franklin Hill Boulevard, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| I am the developer, builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I did speak with Mr. Harmon prior to the BZA meeting, and he never returned my phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4424)|
| 1:13:53| And then the meeting, we attended the meeting, and he had someone to show up to represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| At that time, I decided to stick with my request for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| I have talked, and I have names and phone numbers of, it's not 150 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| but people that live around the property where I'm developing and have no problem with the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| And I also have a building permit that has been issued on 6-20-2008 that consists of a, without a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4460)|
| 1:14:33| I can build a 20-foot wide width home 70 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| And I'm thinking that that home that I had recommended for the variance would be a better fit for that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4480)|
| 1:14:53| And I can give you names and numbers and show you a copy of my building permit if you'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| Any document that you have, also the same thing for you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| if you all would like to have it as made a part of the official record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| if you'll just provide it to the recorder, she will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Next, we'll go back to Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I don't know if this is a question for Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| but if you have something that's presently pending in front of council, how could a permit be issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4513)|
| 1:15:23| I suspect that the permit was issued to comply with the ordinance within the existing regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| and she has since decided to apply for a variance to build a different footprint house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| So she has a permit to build something right now that would not require any variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| Well, you ask if anyone had one to speak against the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| I went out and looked at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| and I was totally in favor of supporting the appeal that was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| because, frankly, there are some very beautiful hardwood trees on the perimeter of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| It seems it would just absolutely destroy the aesthetics of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| and not be in keeping with any of the other immediate properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| So I tend to agree with Ms. Reeves, although she seems to be happy with the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| So it totally surprises me, because I was prepared to support your appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4590)|
| 1:16:38| because I, too, feel this is one of the older neighborhoods in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| and you really can't replace those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| You can't go in and make huge changes in setbacks and so on and not lose the quality of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| And I understand Ms. Chernikin wanting to develop there, because it's a very nice area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| But, unfortunately, the size of the structure that she wants to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| is going to lose so much of the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| that I just simply am not prepared to support her request for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Ms. Chernikin, you've talked about what you can do within the building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| the 25-foot setback and the 6-foot setback that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| What happens at 12-foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| I mean, the neighborhood said, you're right, 25 is a little absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Let's move from 6-foot to 12-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| What kind of house do you build then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Then the house would have to be 30 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| I would have to come up with a different plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And I need to go back and say something regarding the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| I did agree to leave the trees and the shrub as is on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| Nothing would be cut down, as I agreed with the meeting at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| This is a traditional inner city lot, which means it's narrow and long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| And we're talking about a front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| And I'm having a little trouble seeing how in what looks like, again, a very long lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| moving 6-foot from the front changes the house that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| It just feels like if you want to be 6-foot from the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| and you're fine in the back, moving it 6-foot shouldn't impact it that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| So tell me how that makes a big impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| It's a corner lot, so you have two front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| So you have a 25 from the front and 25 feet from the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| But this is the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| This is the Gaston that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| This is the narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| And the house is going to face Gaston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| So I'm having trouble with the – I mean, I could see if we were talking about a side yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| how it could impact it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I don't get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Well, it's the side – it's the – we could be – I was told it would be two front yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| the side setback and the front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| The variance that she has asked for is actually on Canterbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| She has two front yards because she's on a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| Canterbury, not a Gaston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| I didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Well, then that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I think I've had my – I think you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| If I understood, you say that in response to Councilman Becker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| that if you were granted a 12-foot – a variance to a 12-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| as opposed to the six feet you're asking for or the 25 feet you're allowed without variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| that you would design a house that would fit that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| I'm approved for a 20-foot by 70, which I think would not be appropriate for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| But that would be my other option is to utilize the lot in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| Are there 30-foot wide houses in existence in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| Would you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| I would think so, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Mr. Harmon may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| This property that I'm talking about is not part of the North Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| It's right outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| It's not in the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4841)|
| 1:20:49| Boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I don't know what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| But, anyway, this is outside of North Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Mr. Chairman, the North Hills Area Association defined its boundaries from Washington Pike to Cecil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| so it's smack in the middle of that official designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Yeah, if we can just stay on the point whether it's in there or not, I think the appeal, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| It's just another bit of false sense of ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Well, let's not get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Anything else from council members or any motion from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| I was waiting for Commissioner Harmon's rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Would you like to have a rebuttal, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| You have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| You have two minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Time is 822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| One question is what's the hardship here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| I mean, why don't we just redesign the house and make it fit in such a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Councilwoman Palo is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I mean, you could deny and make it go back to the 25 foot on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| and we could live with that as a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| We'd be happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| I'm sure people would be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| We decided as a neighborhood to offer the hand of friendship and say 12 would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| You can build a slightly bigger house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| You can do some things, but we don't, you know, and protect the trees and bushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| She's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| She did agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| But we said let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Let's be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Let's offer our compromise to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Instead, our compromise has been rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| So it's in your hands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| I think the wrong thing to do is to let someone cram something within six feet of Canterbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| The right thing is to either agree with the neighborhood compromise at 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| which I think is a generous gesture, or go back to the 25 and just enforce what the city rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| Those are the reasonable choices before us, and we hope you will make those reasonable choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| I returned a phone message to Ms. Durning just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| I sent out two before the initial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I've been trying to get this arranged, and unfortunately we're at this position where you'll be the deciders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| and I just hope you'll decide in favor of this good neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Based upon the comments here tonight, the record as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| I think the compromise is a reasonable one that this council should support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| Buildings should be built in a way that are as harmonious as possible to the natural flow of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4979)|
| 1:23:08| and the streetscape, and therefore I move to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| I move to approve the appeal subject to the compromise or just the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| The appeal is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| That isn't stated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| It has to be stated in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| We have to move to a six-feasible decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| I thought you were going to say well-feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| I think we have to approve it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| I think you'd have to uphold the appeal contingent upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Hold on, Mr. Horner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I'm jumping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Motion to amend the appeal from 212 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| I was going to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Seeing no further likes from council, all those in favor of the motion, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Now we're on the appeal as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| All those in favor of the appeal as amended, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| We appreciate the participants in this 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Yes, 7-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| And, you know, I just would like to comment, if I may, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| I think it's admirable that the neighborhood has attempted to reach this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| But I'm sorry I couldn't support the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| But just I felt in support of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I just had to stay with my own personal sense of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| But I congratulate you for attempting a compromise, and I hope it will work out well for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| But I just prefer to see the property developed as the other adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| And we appreciate those of you who were in attendance on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Chansey & Reynolds, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| to furnish and install a backup brine chiller for ice plant equipment at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| in a total amount not to exceed $185,758.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| All those in favor, please signify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| You should have looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| You should know that, Mr. Weiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Yes, I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Mr. Polk and I have been playing telephone tag on a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| In the bid form, the bid that Chansey & Reynolds made was actually $151,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and then we've added some alternatives in somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| And I just want to hear what the extra $30-some-thousand is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| I know it's a good thing, but I want to know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| I'm Bob Polk, the Director of Public Facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I'm going to ask Albert Bettinger V, who is a mechanical engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| who's helped us with that, to address that question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| I'll give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| We were asked to do the design work for the backup brine chiller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| and in the process of that we looked at the existing room that holds the existing brine chiller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| and there's some things that probably should be done to bring the thing up to current codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| and a few items that needed to be done to improve the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| make the pumps last a little bit longer and a few things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| So the base bid was in there to have a backup brine chiller installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| That's all it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| And the hopes was that these other items could be done within the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| so they're included in the bid documents as add alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| And since there was enough money that's within the budget, they were accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Seeing no further lights, all in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Those opposed have it likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Madam Recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| 11B is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| of a fee simple interest in certain property located at 1122 Luttrell Street within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| believed to be owned by Dennis Parsons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| and said properties to be used for the city's Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| As has become the practice of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| we have three individuals sign up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Before we take a motion, we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I think the very first name, although he's coming up, his second name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| we're going to take Patrick Hunt first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| If Madeline Rojero wants to give a little background for council, that might help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Does Director Rojero, would she like to give a background for council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| If you want to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I think he would like to hear background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| This property is a property that's been on the chronic problem properties list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| You all are well aware, have been very supportive of that effort in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| You all know that that's an effort to identify really the most egregious chronic problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| that we're dealing with in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| This property was first condemned back in October of 2002 based on outside conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5279)|
| 1:28:08| and fire damage to the attached rear garage and roof deck and outside stairway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| Both codes and community development have worked for the past six years to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| and get these conditions mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| There have been dirty lot violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| The property was declared unfit for human habitation, went through the determination of blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| and certification of blight process with a better building board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| which brings us up over these six years to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| The conditions constituting blight have not yet been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| And in May, you were told by KUB that all the utilities were abandoned with the electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| and gas meters removed in May of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| The property owner has failed to correct these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| and this does meet the criteria for the chronic problem properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| which you provide funding for on an annual basis for us to deal with these kind of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| So we ask for your consideration, and we're glad to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Do you ever get a response from the person that you believe owns it, Dennis Parsons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| We sent the certified letter, and we have not in recent months been able to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| Our staff members call regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| A staff member calls regularly, and there's not an answering machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| and it doesn't answer the phone, so that's why we sent the certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| We have had contact in the past, but we haven't in recent months, though we have tried numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| What's the response been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Is there anybody here related to Mr. Parsons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| Well, hold on before you speak, Mr. Parsons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| because we're going to take in our order those folks who are in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| and then we'll give him an opportunity to speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| We'll give him an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| He hasn't signed up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| We'll recognize those folks who have, and then Council Member Bailey will recognize him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Mr. Hunt, the time is 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| My name is Patrick Hunt, and I live at 1111 Luttrell Street in the historic 4th and Gill Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| just across the street from the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I'm speaking in favor of Resolution 11B authorizing the city to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| Let me begin by saying that as an individual, an entrepreneur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| and an occasional developer of historic properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| I am generally opposed to any government entity acquiring private property without the owner's consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| But I believe the circumstances in this situation make it one of the rare cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| where such a move should not only be contemplated, but taken as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| And let me tell you why this is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I could focus on the fact that the appearance of the property alone is enough to warrant such action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| The property is blighted and detracts greatly from the beauty of our historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| which so many have and are working tirelessly to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| I could focus on this, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| I could focus on the fact that having a property in such horrible condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| is an incredible financial drain on our community in terms of city resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| negative impact on neighborhood house values, and other economic factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| I could focus on this, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| I could focus on the fact that this property in its current condition is a fire hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| with damage likely to occur not just to 1122 Luttrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| but to the immediately adjacent properties or even others in the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| I could focus on this, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Instead, let me focus on one issue and one alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| My wife and I are very fortunate to be the proud parents of a rising two-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Like many of the families in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| we are living in our second home in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Indeed, some are living in their third or even fourth homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| We all believe in the revitalization of the center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| and we are working hard to create a safe, secure neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| that our children and perhaps their children can enjoy for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| We deal with many hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| Property and renovations can be more costly than in other areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and valuations don't always keep pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| Traditional mortgages, even before the recent crisis, were sometimes hard to come by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| and we often go out of pocket and risk other assets to make our homes financially feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| On a daily basis, we work hard to combat petty crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| in part to ensure that it doesn't become more serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| All of this and more, coupled with the location of virtually all city-supported homeless services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| immediately adjacent to our neighborhood, make living in Forth and Gill a real challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| but it's a challenge we all want to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| Being always concerned about your child's welfare in a half-block radius of your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| should not be one of these challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| but primarily because of the current and historical condition of 1122 Luttrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| it is what scares me most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| As our daughter becomes more mobile and more inquisitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| she will no doubt seek to satisfy her newfound freedom and curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| I am very afraid that one day she might peel back an unsecured piece of plywood and crawl inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5585)|
| 1:33:13| What if, at that moment, some catastrophic event were to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| What then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Will we look back at the six-plus years of administrative procedure and think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| wow, perhaps we could have done or should have done something to prevent this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Now is your chance to ensure this never becomes a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| You know, bad things sometimes happen to good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| I have never met the owner of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| and therefore have nothing to offer about his character or circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| neither positive nor negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| But for whatever reason, he has been a bad steward for this particular house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| I wish that the house had been sold and or renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| and become a contributing member to the historic district and our larger community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| but the current condition and recent record suggest that this is not possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| without the city or some other entity taking control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| I'm hopeful that you will pass this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| that the owner will receive fair or better compensation from the city or another buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| and that it will be made safe for the neighborhood, the larger community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| and most importantly, our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| I'm hopeful that after tonight, as I stand and look outside my two-year-old daughter's bedroom window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| I'll feel a little bit better about her safety growing up in our wonderful city and neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| I urge you to vote for Resolution 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And I thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Next, Bill Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| Time is 8.35, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown and honorable members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| My name is Bill Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| I reside at 1130 Gluttrell Street in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| And I, too, am urging you to support 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| This property was condemned prior to my moving into the 4th and Gill neighborhood in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| but I've lived there for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| I've attended numerous meetings about this property with Better Building Board and other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| To this point, the owner has done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| It remains a blight on our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| but I want to speak to you specifically about something that Mr. Hunt mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| and that's the danger of fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Fire knows no property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| And in our neighborhood, as in most historic neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| we have a lot of wood-framed structures with very low lot lines, sometimes zero lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| So what we're looking at now is the opportunity for a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| With the low lot lines, with the wood-framed structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| the fact that the property has already burned once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| and that I personally have had to run vagrants away from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| because they're trying to stay warm behind it because of the irresponsible ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| I urge you to support 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| My background is growing up as the former fire marshal's son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| I respect what fire can do, and I urge you, please, let's do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| The owner of this property has been given six years, six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| and as a historic neighborhood, we bear an unfortunate burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And what I mean by that is the fact that if this property were not in historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| it could have been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| End of story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| We want responsible ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| The current owner is not providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you again for not only your consideration of this request, support of 11B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| but thank you for your leadership, and thank you for allowing me to speak to this honorable body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Melinda Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| The time is 8.37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| You have up to five minutes, ma'am, to name an address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| I'm Melinda Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| I live at 1015 Luttrell Street in historic Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| I've lived in that neighborhood for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| My husband and I moved in in 1980 as young folks, historians and artists, smitten with the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5815)|
| 1:37:05| Our parents questioned our judgment, but we were in love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| We have, in fact, spent 30 years preserving architectural history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| and helping build a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Most importantly, and I hate to sound like a broken record and repeating Mr. Hunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| but most importantly, we have raised our son there, and we have created a place called home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| I give you this information as an introduction to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| but the truth is it would introduce any resident of Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| And there are several here, and I would like for them to stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| We are here tonight asking for the request from Community Development that 1122 Luttrell Street be acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5863)|
| 1:37:55| We are looking to cure blight in the neighborhood and to effect ownership change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| I am also standing here tonight as a commissioner with Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| and I'm wearing that hat, asking you to look at a historic piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| and making sure that it is preserved for a neighborhood that is an early, late 18th, early 19th century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5891)|
| 1:38:19| no, got it wrong, late 19th, early 20th century intact historic neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| and that this structure be preserved for the integrity of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| I have one other thing I would like you to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| and this comes from a piece of the mayor's inaugural address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| I'm sorry he's not here tonight to hear me actually try to quote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| He'd probably be impressed that I listen so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| But in his inaugural address, he was speaking to endeavors the city had made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| and successes the city had made, this administration and this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| He talked about those successes with great pride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| and said that because of those successes private dollars had been invested in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| and that you all considered that a huge indicator, a proverbial pat on the back of a job well done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| and a partnership that was going to be invested with private dollars and public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| Well, in our neck of the woods, just the opposite is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| The successes in Forth and Gill are primarily due to private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| We would also consider it a wonderful pat on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| and recognition of our successes to be in partnership with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| This is your perfect opportunity to tell us job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| We support what you do for the inner city and for neighborhood building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| Please support us in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| And most importantly, more than the dollars and just the support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| in terms of dollars and finance and seeing what could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| is that partnership as we help build city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| We have all spoken of home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| It is our hope that this piece of property can be placed on the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| and that you will help us continue to build home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| That's all the individuals signed up and the three individuals that are signed up in favor of 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6016)|
| 1:40:23| I believe we do have someone here speaking against, if you come forward, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| to give us your name, address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| The time is 841.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| I'm Dennis Parsons, and I'm the person that's concerned with the property, 1122 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6034)|
| 1:40:43| Forgive me that I'm not very well prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| that I only received the letter that this hearing was to be yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| This was my first notification was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| And there's some, I'm not as skilled a speaker as those that went before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6056)|
| 1:41:07| but maybe I can plead my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| There were mentioned that nothing has been done to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| and that couldn't be further from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Within the last year, I've completely replaced the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| There's a brand new roof on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| Fascia, soffits, this has been replaced around the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6086)|
| 1:41:35| I was a victim of the garage being burned in the back to no fault of my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| It was locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| I guess someone can break into anyone's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| But it did not do any damage to the physical structure of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| But I did replace the roof and fascia, soffits, all the way around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6111)|
| 1:42:01| Just this spring, I have completed removing the back deck off the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| the entrance in the rear, and I have prepared to have the roof on the garage replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6129)|
| 1:42:21| Just weeks ago, I've already set the concrete anchors to bolt the roof on the garage in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6141)|
| 1:42:31| I've started paint work, and honestly, I wish I'd started the paint work in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| because I think that's people's more objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| But since there was damage in the back, I started in the back, and I should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| The house is a sound house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| All the windows and doors are intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| The doors work, lock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| It's been characterized as some sort of fire hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| but it's no more a fire hazard than other houses as I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| I'm over there often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| I'm keeping it mowed, and I'm trying to do something on it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| And I think because I haven't got the – I should have painted it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| If you take a brand-new house with no paint on it, it doesn't look very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| And I had – I've done these things, and like I said, I've got a contractor already scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6207)|
| 1:43:38| to put the roof back on the back garage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| And it was my understanding that I couldn't tear it down, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| so I've recently gone back to work, and I've got new income that allows me to fix this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6227)|
| 1:43:57| This letter that I just received yesterday notes that perhaps there's programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| that would allow me to fix it with the city's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| I would just become aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| And it is my personal home place that I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| And I have done all these things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| That's made the house, you know, with the new roof, new shingles and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| I think is a major undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| And with fresh paint on the house, I think it would look similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| and be in similar condition to many of the houses up and down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| And I regret that I haven't got it done quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| If you'll allow me just a little bit more time, I can get with the community task development center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| And if they would like for me to get a schedule of when to have what done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| I'd be perfectly happy to do that and schedule and have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6304)|
| 1:45:12| anything that is considered a blight about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| You have one more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| And so I guess I'm at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| I'm sure you have the power to take my house from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| And I just pray that you'll give me some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| and allow me to work out a schedule to have anything that's considered to be a blight repaired on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6335)|
| 1:45:42| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| Representative, for those in favor, can have a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| Yes, Mr. Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| It disturbs me that the gentleman just said he started work on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| He's not gone before his zoning commission, according to a member who's present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| There is not since, not in the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| And also, he does not have a valid building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| He's just admitted to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| I have personally attended the Better Building Board meetings where Mr. Parsons was in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| He was clearly told, you are in jeopardy of losing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Folks, six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Let's just end this insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| We are looking at the perfect storm for a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| That's not what any of us want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| The current owner has been given ample opportunity to correct the problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| and quite frankly, he's currently living overnight in the house illegally without utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| Summertime, if you want to sleep while you're hot, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| What happens in the winter without utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| There's kerosene coming into that house most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| We're looking at a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| It's a perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| I hope you'll vote to end this and support the Community Development Department's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Let me ask you, are you in favor of or against the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| I'm in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Let me introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| Just one second for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Let's get someone to make an amendment to extend the number of speakers in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| We'll take that by unanimous consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| The time is 8.48, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| My name is Parks Moore, and I'm Dennis Parson's uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| Now, we've all had problems in our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| Well, Dennis is the only child of the Keith and Mabel Parsons, and he had a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6461)|
| 1:47:55| And his father worked at Oak Ridge, and he passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6475)|
| 1:48:03| And then a couple years after that, Dennis lost his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| He worked at Phillips Electronics, and he had a good job, and he lost his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| Then a few years later, he lost his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| So he has had problems trying to get finances together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| and I personally believe he's doing the best he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| and wants to do better with people's understanding and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| Now, there's a lot of people that gets down and out and has nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| And it's our responsibility to try to fix things instead of tearing them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| And I'm in favor of Dennis getting some kind of help through to this is his home place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6531)|
| 1:48:59| He was raised there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| And that's about all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| Ms. Rogero, would you or someone from your department like to comment on what we have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| and the policies and procedures that you used to come to this decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| Angela Robert from the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| I will speak as to the process that has been followed in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| This first came before the Better Building Board in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| It went through a determination process, and I'm not really clear as to the circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| but it went back before the Better Building Board a second time in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| It was then determined blighted through a new process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| and the owner was given 90 days to repair the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| An order was recorded in the Register of Deeds Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| and the owner did not make the repairs within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| That was in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| As you can see, it's now three years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| The conditions which constitute blight have not been eliminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| and the property went back before the Better Building Board to certify that it is, in fact, blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| The certification process, during that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| the Better Building Board certifies that the property still meets the condition of blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| and then it makes some other findings, and that certification is in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6629)|
| 1:50:38| The reason this property is before you three years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| is because the city has attempted on several occasions to work with Mr. Parsons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| They have contacted different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I can't give you all the names because I don't know them for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| but I do know that Mr. Lee Miracle, who handles the real estate for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| contacted Mr. Parsons a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| and at that time Mr. Parsons informed him that he would be making repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| painting, doing the repair work to the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| and doing repairs to the exterior trim of the residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| and that he had intentions to cure the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| At that time, Mr. Miracle asked for a renovation schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| and he asked for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| That was in February 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| Mr. Parsons never provided that renovation schedule and has not made the repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| The property does not have utilities connected at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| and the property is still in the same condition that it was, you know, a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6709)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I'm not really saying this in jest, but Rob Frost, 1022 Electoral Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| I'm a little more than a block away from here, second home in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| We have lost a number of residents here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| I mean, realize that, I mean, we're not a big neighborhood like Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| or Sequoia Hills or West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| We have a little around 250 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Counting the number of households that were here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| we had about 10 percent of the households represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| so this is certainly an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| I believe Bill Pittman was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| I think there have been two fires at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| and they've both been on clear nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| The neighbors often mow the yard of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| I wouldn't suggest that you hold this against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| but I believe Deputy Public Service Director David Brayson informed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| that Mr. Parsons has been through the Better Building Board process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| on another piece of property outside of an overlay zoning before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| and that property was bulldozed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| I think this is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| You know, you all have been stuck with me since 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| some of you a shorter period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| But it's issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| You know, when I volunteered my time for my neighborhood organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| that's how I got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| That's what led me to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| Six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| This is a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| I certainly do care about property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| but I also care about the property rights of those in the surrounding vicinity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| those folks that are immediately adjoining front, back, side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| I mean, there are fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| You know, old houses have old wood, which is dry and burns quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| Change happens often in incremental measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| This is a change that needs to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| In the approximately 13 years I've lived in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| I do not believe that this house has been occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| I mean, it's gotten occupied in the past two weeks because of this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| I certainly could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| I think it's time to respect the property rights of those surrounding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| I'd like to, you know, thank the city departments for who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| the various departments that have handled this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| that have attempted to come to some sort of amicable resolution of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| Unfortunately, it has not gotten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| And, unfortunately, this council has been asked to take action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| I'm going to move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Mr. Parsons, I know she had your hand up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And if you'd come down, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| and then I'd be interested in hearing what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| And primarily my question would be, you know, why did it come down to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| And why should we believe you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Because, you know, as someone that does stand up for people's property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| and I think this is good for everybody to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| and to expose all of what's taken place, and, you know, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| And I'm especially interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| But people, your neighbors, do have rights, and they invest in their properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| and we've seen things here in the city that were neglected and fire occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| and it's a real hazard to the community and it's a safety issue, and they're right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| But I'd just like to know, from your standpoint, why should we believe you now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| and why does it come down to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| I have the wherewithal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| Recently, this is the first of the year, I've gotten a very good new job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| and I have the money to fix it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| And before I was struggling financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| and I could not borrow the money because I wasn't working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| and now I'm working, I have a very good job, and I can finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| I would characterize it as nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| A brand new roof on an old house was very expensive, and I had that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| and that was a major, major part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| I've got the back of the house, the finished demolition of the garage area of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=6997)|
| 1:56:45| and I've got it prepped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| I've got bolts ready for the roof to go back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Have you ever reached out to your neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Have you ever, like, tried to go to them first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| and understand that there's laws on the books and, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| Oh, I would like to address the fact that I did buy building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| and I did go to the historic society and get their paperwork, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7025)|
| 1:57:17| I bought both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| And it's my understanding that as long as you're working on a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| that the billing permit can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| And I have been working on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| And I really trust me that it would be a shame, now that I do have finances, to finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7049)|
| 1:57:40| The major thing is the house needs painting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| It looks ugly because it's not painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| It's got a good roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| The water works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| They said they were talking like no utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| I'm ready to have the utilities turned back on as soon as they'll let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| Everything should work fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| The water, I turned to have the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Can you turn the water on for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| So the bathrooms work just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| So it's overstated the fact of it's been characterized unfairly by some very good speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7085)|
| 1:58:15| You know, very good speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| Did you ever consider selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Well, I wanted to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| You know, it was mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| I've lost a lot lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| I'm just now in a position where I can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| And I believe the neighbors would welcome me as a neighbor if they got to know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| I've been keeping the lot mowed very tidily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| And here again, I was just notified yesterday at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| so that I didn't know it was coming down here until yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| So I wasn't prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| Do you know what it's appraised at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| Do you know what it's estimated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| I'm looking at a figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Acquisition cost is estimated at $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| Anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| I would just, if you could give me another chance and let me finish it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| I would certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| Mr. Parsons, before you sit down, a couple more questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| Have you been living in that house at all recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| I've been going over there working very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| and I've been staying over there as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| People were concerned that the house wasn't occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| So I think, you know, people say they want someone there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7188)|
| 1:59:54| and they're concerned that nobody's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Now they complain that I'm there all the time working on the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| and I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| You said you have a building permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| Is that a current building permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| When was the last time it was inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| I had inspections when I had the roof put on last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7215)|
| 2:00:22| It's been more than six months since the last inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| Well, probably the last inspection, but there's been work continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| I don't know that I've had an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| You probably do not have a current building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I would say that that's the case if it's lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| And I think that they can supply the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| Well, it would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| You know, I bought the building permits in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| and I've been trying to fix the house in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| and I think it would be unfair to try to find some, you know, minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| Mr. Parsons, I had building permits on my house in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| and I had to go take out new permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| I had to get current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| I have to keep my inspections current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| Those are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| I'd be happy to buy a fresh permit if that's what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| You're doing, you say you're doing concrete foundations or anchors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| Well, just the roof, the top of the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| I put in anchor bolts to anchor the new roof on for the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7281)|
| 2:01:29| and just set, I think you're supposed to put anchors, you know, in the concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| a small amount of concrete to make fastenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| It was my understanding that I could replace what was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| In other words, just build it back like it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| And so while I was doing it, I was trying to make it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| a little bit better than it was just sort of nailed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| But you have to understand that you are required to get those things inspected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| especially if they're structural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| Because if you're anchoring roofs, roofs can be blown off in wind storms, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| That's the reason for inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Well, that was just completed, and so I'd be happy to have that inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| That was just prep work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| It was just prep work for the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| I think I'd like to hear from our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| in terms of where that stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Also, if you're staying in a structure, it may have been, when it was condemned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| it may have been deemed unsuitable for human habitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| in which case you're not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| It's illegal for you to live in the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Well, I wouldn't consider it a residence, but I've been over there working a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Well, if you're staying in it, that's probably not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| But I'll see what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| In answer to your last question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| the property was condemned as unfit for human habitation, and that still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| Based on the records I have, the permits are not currently open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| The most recent permit expired in May 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| There's also an extensive history of permits to replace the roof beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| it looks like, in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| and there have been a series of permits that have been issued to replace expired permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| So these seem to be all the same type of permits to replace roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| to repair, to bring it up to code, to lift the condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| and they have expired repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| So the most recent one expired in May 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Well, I had the roof replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| The roof was replaced and was inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| and deemed okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Thank you for your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| There is currently a motion that was made by Council Member Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| but I'm not sure I heard a second to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| Anything else from Council Members at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| Yes, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| I'm just going to ask this one question to the representatives of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Is there any scenario that you would consider with him to allow him to honor what he's committed to tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7435)|
| 2:04:06| You know, Bill, if somebody wants to just say yes or no, I think it sort of boils down to trust here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7446)|
| 2:04:15| He's committed to doing these things numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| He hadn't done it, although he said earlier that, you know, if you're showing improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7458)|
| 2:04:26| signs of improvement, if you're working on it, then the city works along with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| And, you know, that's kind of what I'd always heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| But I'm just wondering if it's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| And is there any consideration at all to allow him to do these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| In all due respect to what we've heard tonight, it does come down to exactly what you said, which is a trust issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| It's very difficult to trust a person who's had all this time and refuses to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| And we do have, as Mr. Frost pointed out, our own property rights that we would like to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| and it's very difficult for us to do anything but ask you to support us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7494)|
| 2:05:02| Any other further comments from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| I'll just say one more thing, Mr. Parsons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| $80,000 is quite a bit of money, considering six years of what they've endured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| And, you know, that's a pretty good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| And maybe you can go back over there and buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| Seeing no further light, all those in favor of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| which is to approve the resolution authorizing the acquisition of the property, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| The only thing I would just like to say is if we do acquire it, it's a fairly good piece of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| and I hope that we will continue the process of trying to, when we put it back out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| to get the full value of the taxpayer dollar back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| You know, I know we've done a good job of that here lately, but sometimes we spend more money getting these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| than we turn around and get back when we put them out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| So let's make sure that if this does occur that we get the taxpayer dollar back for what's going to probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| after it's fixed up, be a very valuable piece of property in a very good neighborhood with high property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7561)|

| 2:07:30| Do you anticipate it taking until July 1 of next year to complete the design work on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7650)|

| 2:07:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7673)|

| 2:11:29| Before we entertain any discussion or motion, I'd like to recognize Law Director Poplin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| I wanted to explain to Council that this ordinance isn't just an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7897)|
| 2:11:41| It was actually passed by Council in May of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| It was designated within that ordinance to be put on the general state election ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| for August the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| There was a technical problem with that in that the general state election is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| That was the general county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| That's going to be August 7th and not the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| So due to those technicalities, we felt it was, we needed to amend this and bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| So if you pass it tonight, it will be sent to be put on the ballot for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| So it only changes really getting the correct date in it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7938)|

| 2:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| So if we vote to put this on the ballot, will this take care of the orange or the white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=7946)|

| 2:14:06| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| I guess I know it's late, and I'll try to be quick with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| I have a couple concerns about the traffic access on this property, and I'll raise these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| and, you know, if people think they're valid, we can talk about some potential solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| One, this area's been designated mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| This is a transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| This is going to be changing from residential into office and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| In the long run, I think it's much smarter to have access to Corbett than to not have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| We've made the decision that this neighborhood is transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| We did that almost 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| So I have a concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| I also have some concerns in discussing this with city engineering about limiting the driveways going on to Millertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8086)|
| 2:14:55| If you all look at your map here, we've got a lot of property along here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| and I think we need to do something, and I'm not quite sure what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| And, again, we can think about it if there are other people concerned with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| The potential of lots of driveways forming on Millertown here, that's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| As this area develops, Millertown is going to be more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| The area is going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| It's going to have more traffic, and I think we should think about that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| If anybody thinks that's worthwhile, we can continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| Mr. Donaldson, do you care to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| The condition to eliminate the connectivity to Corbett came as a result of comments from that residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8132)|
| 2:15:43| as well as the buffering requirement or condition that was put on the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8143)|
| 2:15:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| I didn't understand the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| As well as the buffering requirement that was put as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8158)|
| 2:16:06| Any further discussion or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| Did we get a motion on this matter already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8171)|

| 2:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Similar issue, and I'll do it again if anybody wants to talk about this, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| The Callahan Road study, which we did a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| talked about the importance of making Callahan Road a street that carries traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| I mean, it was the sector plan designation for all this on Callahan, New Callahan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| is light industrial as a way to try and limit driveway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| Now, we haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| There are some property issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| One could say that it's already beyond repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8298)|

| 2:18:30| They're going to want access right on Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| I'd like us to consider, because they're right on Old Callahan, they're right on a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| to look at something to limit access on Old Callahan to get some of what we originally intended in the plan done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| which is to limit driveway access onto Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| So it's my spiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| It's Callahan, Old Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8328)|

| 2:18:58| Well, is there anyone here to speak to that property or that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| You said don't usually win?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| Isn't that an over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| We don't need to be that specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080715?start=8350)|
