| 0:00:32| Welcome to the June meeting of the Agenda Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=32)|
| 0:00:40| Before we get started, I turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| I'd like to recognize Amy Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| For those of you who have not had the opportunity to meet her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| I want Amy to introduce herself and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| Thanks, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| I appreciate the opportunity to be here and work with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| I appreciate Mayor Ken Cannon's appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| and look forward to spending at least the next four years with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| My background mainly comes from neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| I've been really involved with my neighborhood at Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| I've lived there for 22 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| and have been on both sides of the argument many times when it comes to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| Most recently, I worked with the RICO Knoxville on the Stakeholder Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| and hope that I can kind of bring some of the history to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| and to that document that I spent many years working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| I look forward to getting to know all of you very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I also want to publicly thank Dick Graff and his wife, Ann,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| for hosting what I think was an excellent social gathering of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Really the first time that we've had together, opportunity to get together with each other for over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| and that includes the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| A number of staff members were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Dick, you and Ann, thanks so much for a wonderful evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| We really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| We have a fairly lengthy agenda for today's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| and so at this point, I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| It's great to be with you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| I just have a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Staff has begun working on the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| It's been on our work program since last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| Resolutions were passed in early 2021 by Knoxville City Council as well as Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| requesting that planning staff study Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| As many of you are probably aware, there's a realignment of Alcoa Highway happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| and there is some interest and concern regarding land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| and how those new transportation improvements will impact land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| and also looking ahead to how does the community that lives around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| really begin to create some additional opportunity for economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| but also other amenities that the community would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| So we've kicked this project off internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| and we will soon begin engaging key stakeholders to help us define the appropriate study area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| as well as desired outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Our schedule is quite ambitious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| We are hoping to present final recommendations to this body in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| so that it can go forward to Council and Commission after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| So please stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| We will share updates as we have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| and as soon as we start the public engagement portion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| you all will know well in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| As many of you know, we have also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Knox County, Knox County Mayor has recently announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| the comprehensive land use transportation plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| There is a, on our webpage, there's an article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and planning staff has also developed a webpage for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| So as this plan progresses, we'll be adding information to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| We gave a presentation yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| It was myself, Jeff Welch, as well as Knox County engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| and Director Snowden to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| as part of the Chairman's Briefing where we discussed plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| and all the plans that we have in Knox County and how they're related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| and we touched briefly on this new opportunity that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| So we're really excited about that and happy to discuss it in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| And if you all would like to, we will be posting the presentation that we gave yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| on our website if it isn't already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| I think it is something that we would like to present to this body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| You know, we talk a lot about plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| but sometimes it gets lost in the details of the monthly day-to-day of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Amy, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Is it public information to get a copy of the description that went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| under the request for a letter to the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| so that the public can get a general idea of the scope of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| that the general plan will address and what elements it may or may not include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| Yes, it's on the Knox County's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| I believe, I don't know exactly what page it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I'm happy to send it out, but they have a procurement section on their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and so the LOI is listed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Our staff, Liz Albertson, recently posted the same information to planning.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| to also encourage firms that might be looking there for opportunities for long-range plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| So that information is out there, and it's accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| Speaking of presentations to this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I've been thinking about and would like your feedback regarding how you all would like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Typically, we've had very long agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| We've had very long agendas over the last year and a lot to cover during these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| but we also like to provide opportunity for education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| and to provide you all with resources that help you make decisions on a monthly basis here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| So we can continue to identify speakers and presentations that we think are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| with your input as well monthly here at the agenda review meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| or we could set up quarterly sessions where we can spend a little bit more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| and I would love your feedback on what you all would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| Not everybody speak up at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| It is unusual for this group not to have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| I would lean toward quarterly on the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| because these agendas are seemingly long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| and we're going two hours and better in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| I agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Ditto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| It looks like we have a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Well, I will set up that quarterly, those quarterly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| I'll send it out for some additional feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I really encourage you all, if you have ideas or thoughts on topics that you would like presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| at those quarterly meetings to give me a call or shoot me an e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| and let me know what your thoughts are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Is it still going to be possible to have PowerPoints, PDFs, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| those kinds of things that the staff is producing shared with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| so that there's not a giant gap of knowledge being missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| but we can kind of keep up in that fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| For some of the longer range projects that we're working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Well, a lot of times what you're presenting at these sessions, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| it's keeping us all abreast and making sure that we're aware of things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Those can continue to be kind of dripped out to us in addition to the quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| If I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| we'll still have these meetings where the staff are presenting on the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| And then as we do work in between those meetings, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| we're happy to share those out and provide additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Is that what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| That's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Are we ready to jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| So the first agenda item is number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| It's 5B21SC, and this is Richard Clark's request for a right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| And Michelle Porche will take this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| We talked a little bit about this last month very briefly as it was postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| but we'll kind of go into a little more detail today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| This is the closure of Glenmore Drive off of Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| So it butts up against West Hills and Bynum Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| the official park entries right now for vehicles are Sheffield Drive and North Winston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| And there's additional pedestrian opportunities at this right-of-way that's requested for closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| and this one is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| And here's just a map to kind of give you a little bit more context as to what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| So in terms of the reason for the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| the applicant initially stated that he had submitted plans for his pool and his fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| They were denied because he didn't meet the setback requirements for a corner side setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| and also the fence was too high in addition to not meeting that setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| or actually being in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| And so, you know, based on that information, we began reviewing the item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| and then once the neighbors heard about the request, we received a lot of opposition last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| I'm sure you remember getting a lot of e-mails about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| And then that request was expanded to include public safety as a reason for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| And then once I notified the applicant that we would be recommending denial of the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| the reason was again expanded to include flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| So you'll be hearing about that from him on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| To give you a little bit more context, here's what it looks like in Street View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| This is the approach to Glenmore right here with the park in the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| And then kind of moving in a little bit closer, this is what it looked like a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| There were bollards up here with a basketball goal, which belonged to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| And then one of the residents, I'm not sure if it was Mr. Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| but someone removed the bollards and then replaced it with this landscaping here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| So that's what it currently looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| In terms of the site plan, that was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| This is what the applicant submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| It shows the pool at 18 feet from the property line or from the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| But since the fence isn't in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| it's showing that it's 18 feet from something within the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| So it clearly doesn't meet the 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Brief history of the pool and the fence installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| So the City's Plans Review Inspections Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| has a record of an unpermitted pool being installed in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| It was an above-ground pool that was removed and the matter was resolved and closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| In 2020, they put it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| They received a notice of violation and a stop work order for unpermitted in construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and installation of an above-ground pool, fence, and interior renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| And in early 2020, the applicant submitted site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Those plans were denied, again, because of those setback issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And then in August 2020, the applicant filed for a BZA variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| to increase the height of the fence but withdrew the application before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| The notes for the BZA case state that the application was being withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| so the applicant could pursue a right-of-way closure to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| A variance has not yet been sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| So we are recommending denial because it provides pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| that neighborhood residents actively use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| and it leaves the option open for later park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Last month, we had recommended postponement to look at the applicant's plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| what he had said he would be willing to put in an access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And so we do have those options to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| And planning reviewed these with the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| and we also met with Parks and Recreation to kind of get a determination on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| So option one adds new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| It doesn't say what those signs would say, presumably that the right-of-way was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| but most people probably wouldn't really notice those so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| I don't expect conditions on the ground would change beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Option two includes painted crosswalks for pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And then options three and option four both sort of close off that right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| after the driveways, which have their access off of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| So the city's engineering department was not in support of any of these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| due to mainly ADA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| For it to be a public pedestrian access, it would have to meet ADA requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| in terms of cross-slope width, slope down the length of travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| just where they're located, certain types of buffering, things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| that are in the engineering's response document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So for that reason and for the reason that the neighborhood uses the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and Parks and Rec express maybe an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| who knows how the park could develop in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| So this leaves that option open to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| So we're recommending not allowing that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Now that was kind of a lot. I don't know if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Is the encroachment just the fence or is it the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| The pool and the fence, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| So you're saying, no, wait a minute, I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| The pool is in the right-of-way or it's over the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| It's within the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| So in the corner yard setback is 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Okay, so in terms of what's in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| the fence is the only thing and that can be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| and then he will have no issue with the right-of-way once that fence is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Yes, the fence could be moved to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| And I should say, too, the pool is an above-ground pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| It's not in-ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| The applicant did grade that property to provide a little bit of slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and then kind of moved it in, but it's sort of half-in, half-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| But it's not like it's a concrete pool that's cut into the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| that would be really hard for him to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| Ms. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Could you point out the other access points that the public has again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| Yeah, so this is looking in KGIS Sheffield Drive along through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| which is off of Vannisdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| This is one of the access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| The other one is off of North Winston Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| and it's about a half-mile from here to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| And then the other access point is off of Churchill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| very similar circumstance to this one, but also very close to Sheffield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| So if you were going to look at closing one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| this would be the more viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| But because this one is more centrally located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| and services more of these properties to the northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| and people were still wanting to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| it makes sense to us to leave it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Yes, I had two questions, and I'll ask them again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| so they're in the record Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| The first one is I didn't quite follow the sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Did the notice of violation occur before the pool was completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| Could you run through that sequence again, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| of when the notices occurred and at what stage the pool was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| So an above-ground pool was installed initially in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| and it did not meet these same conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| and so it was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| The matter was resolved and closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| It was unpermitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Again, in July 2020, that's when they installed the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| The fence had been removed somewhere around 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| so for about 10 years they had no fence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| So July 2020 is when they installed the fence and the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| They were issued a stop work order due to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| neighborhood complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| These types of things are typically complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| In August 2020, he submitted site plans to be approved to get the permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| but they were denied because he didn't meet the ordinance conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| And this is the same owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| And my second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| even if the options somehow were approved and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| since they failed to meet the ADA standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| what is the repercussion with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Would the applicant still be able to install those options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| They wouldn't be able to get approved for those without meeting ADA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| And my understanding from engineering is building something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| would cost well into the tens of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| I know the applicant's neighbor that lives on the other side of this right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| is in support of the request initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Then he contacted me, wasn't so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| He wanted to accept responsibility of the maintenance and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| and then he came back again and said, yes, he was still in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| So just kind of based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| I don't think he'd be willing to devote tens of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| in an effort to help Mr. Clark get this right-of-way closed to install ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| Of course, that's just my take on it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I haven't spoken to him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So at the last meeting, if my memory serves me correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I believe Mr. Clark indicated that there had been some drug activity in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Do we know if the Knoxville Police Department has been called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| for any activities that have been going on, as he claimed in that last workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| I can reach out to the police department and try to find a history of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| I just need to get with someone who can tell me who to contact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Okay, so if there is a road closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| would that give him the opportunity to purchase that land and absorb it into his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and then he'd have complete control over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Or would that paved road still be there for pedestrian access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| It would just be technically closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Yeah, so what happens with road closures is the land is divided in half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| and distributed to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| So half of it would go to Mr. Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| and the other half would go to the neighbor across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| And then from there, it's their property to do with however they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| So if they wanted to leave it as is, they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| or make whatever improvements at that point, it would be their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Moving on to item number 11, it's 5G21RZ Jenkins Builders Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| I think it's on Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Yeah, so this one is located out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| It is on Old Tazewell Pike near Tazewell Pike at the intersection with Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Just giving you a little bit of context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| you can see the property around it has already been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| There's some neighborhoods to the south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| The sector plan has this property designated LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and the growth plan map has it in the rural area directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| from the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| And then finally looking at zoning, it's currently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| There's PR zoning up to three dwelling units per acre on the rural area side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| and then up to seven, up to five on the urban growth boundary side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| And so looking at this one, it's got some complexity to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| because typically we do see LDR requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| and they do allow up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| But when you look at the land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| that's only for the urban growth area and planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| The growth policy plan and the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| don't support the LDR in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| This is kind of a remnant left over from previous, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| iterations of that classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| It was expanded in 2007, and that's when rural residential was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| So prior to that, really LDR was kind of the only game in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| And so rural residential would allow up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| in the rural area of the county provided a TIS was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| to show that there would be no impacts on properties or roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| that go through the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| In this instance, because it's the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| and not the planned growth area, we don't require a TIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| for that three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| But so in this instance, we're supporting the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| and recommending that maximum three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| that's allowed in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| With that said, looking at the zoning across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| there is up to five and up to seven already in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| so it's not out of context with what's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| It's just a question of supporting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| With that, I'll open it up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Is that property below it, did it actually develop out at seven units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| or is it less than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I did not do a calculation to see what the actual build-out number was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| I can provide that for you in e-mail later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Commissioner Korbelick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Yes, I was just a little confused about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| The staff review indicated that the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| met the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| If the applicant is requesting more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| would the sector plan have to be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| No, because it's LDR already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| so we wouldn't make them downgrade to the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Can I ask one other question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Did you guys do a slope calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| I know that property, at least I've been by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| and I can't remember the topo on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| I know that's a guideline, it's not a strict, hard rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| but would it accommodate more than three on the slope analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Since it's not in the hillside and protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| we did not run a slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Okay, moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Do any of the analyses take into consideration the developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| that have just been approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Because I know that either one docket or two dockets back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| there were other significant developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| that were approved right along that same roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| So these assessments, are they taking those into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| Yes, those were in different areas and different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| So the rural area and the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| and the planned growth boundary kind of ebb and flow in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| So even though it might all be along the same road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| it's not one condition that follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| So we do look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| Okay, thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| I think the next one is yours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Number 19, 6G21RZ, it also has a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| So this one is located on Rutledge Pike at its intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| with Roberts Road and Chipe Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Roberts Road is a minor arterial, Rutledge Pike is a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| To give you a little bit of context, this is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| It's kind of located, kind of feels more part of these parcels along that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| Looking at the zoning map, you can see it's all agricultural behind here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| developed with single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Sector plan has this property designated as NC, basically at this node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| trying to create a node that recognizes the need to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| the residential areas around it with services, professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| things like that, that the residents might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| With that said, looking back at the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| a lot of these properties are incompatible with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| and this kind of goes way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| So this is that same intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| So these properties that have that light industrial and commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| were in place prior to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| So this is the very first sector plan that was adopted for the northeast sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| It was in 1984, and those properties were already CA and LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| The only properties that were recently rezoned were the properties down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| and this body recommended denial of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| It was just overturned at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So in this one, we're looking at whether or not to approve the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| Staff really feels like the CN land use designation is the right designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| and so it would allow the CN zone, which is not what they're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| but just to kind of look at if you are going to put commercial uses in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| And so this is all the uses that are allowed within CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| versus all the uses that are allowed with CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| and some of these things really aren't compatible next to single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| And so that's the reason that we're recommending denial of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| It's basically because we don't feel like CA uses are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| right next to single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| and just to be consistent with our past recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| And that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| If anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Oh, there is going to be, as far as changes of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| there is a TDOT expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| They're adding a turn lane here, so the property is fairly shallow along this route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| and so the entire length of that property would be within that taper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So it's unclear whether TDOT would approve an entry or exit onto this part of that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| so they probably have to have their access from Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| Michelle, is there a parcel on Shiptown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| or is that part of the right of way for Shiptown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| On the, I guess, north side of Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Is there a parcel between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Is that right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| That's the right of way, mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| So they do have frontage then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| They have access to Shiptown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| No, Shiptown is on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| This is Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I think that's why I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| They do have frontage on Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| It's just unclear whether TDOT would approve an entry because of that turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| It's going to be right in the deceleration part of that turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Any questions, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Yes, this would be an example of where those two PDFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| the intersection design and the use list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| if we could have that to review a little more closely before Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| I'd like to study on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| I'm moving on to item number 10, which is 4M21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| There's a sector plan amendment as well as a plan amendment associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| this one that's been postponed since, looks like April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| Take a minute to load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Give me just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Amy, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Is this the item that we heard a couple of months ago and the gentleman got up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| to speak, one of the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| And we kind of didn't hear him initially and then we, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| And you'll notice there's been a, and Liz will go over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| there's been a change in what they're requesting to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And I think in response to some conversations they've had with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| So, yeah, this should look pretty familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| You've seen it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| The county case for this project has already moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| We're now reviewing the city case for the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| the plan, one-year plan amendment, and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| This is the southwest side of I-75 at Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| This is Callahan shown in yellow, and this is I-75 in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| They are primarily asking to go to the IG zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| So to accommodate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| they need to expand this mixed-use special district that is primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| currently along Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| However, we have received a request as of June 1st from the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| Alan Grissom with Cannon & Cannon, who is representing the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| They have asked to have a portion of their request removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| So this is the area that is south of Keck Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| So it's actually a portion of one parcel and the entirety of this small parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| So we'll now look at what the zoning map looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| So, again, this is the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| They're asking to have this area removed south of Keck Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| including this little portion that is just north of Keck Road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| And so all of this area that's hatched here would go to IG if the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:45| amendment, one-year plan amendment, and rezoning are amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| This is the one-year plan designation for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| You can see this mixed-use special district that allows consideration of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| industrial land use or industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Again, this area is requested to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And this is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| So you can see the low-density residential surrounding this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| The applicant has met at least two times with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| and they have asked to have this section removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| So our staff recommendation is to approve the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| and we are requesting to eliminate this area from the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| So when you see the motion on the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| you'll see a portion of this parcel removed and the entirety of that smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| parcel removed for all three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| On the portion, the portion that's going to remain unchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| that was at the request of those neighbors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| So it was actually requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| They had had a meeting, it says, with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| I believe they met on June 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| and they notified us later that evening that they had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| come to basically, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| an agreement with the community that they would remove this section from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| And the part that we are considering for rezoning, there will not be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| there's no plan review on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| but are there considerations made for lighting, visual screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| or anything along that road to protect those neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| Because I know that was one of the things they talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| So anything moving forward in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| the plan approval process on the city side for the IG zone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| would happen at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| So if there were any lighting recommendations in that IG zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| that's what would apply at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So we're not conditioning anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| So the lighting is required though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| There are standards in the city zoning ordinance for properties that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| adjacent to residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Yeah, there's additional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Let's move on to item number 14, which is 6B21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| It also includes a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Carla, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| This is the south side of Ball Camp Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| which will be the forthcoming Shod Road extension improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| This is Hitching Post Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| This is Ball Camp Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| This is also Ball Camp Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| These are the soccer fields that you may have heard mentioned several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| in some community emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| This is Nicholas Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Down in this area is Middlebrook Pike and Wigles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| And the applicant is requesting to go from an open space sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| designation to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and they are also requesting a rezoning from planned residential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| This is what the zoning map looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Again, you can see the already acquired right-of-way for Shod Road coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| The park had been previously zoned planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| and a portion of this area along the right-of-way that has since been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| acquired for the Shod Road improvements was also zoned planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So they are requesting to rezone this to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Again, you can see the commercial zoning down in this location and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| This is the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| You can see on the sector plan designation showing up as open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and the city Ball Camp Park showing up as public park designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| This area around the intersection with Middlebrook Pike is showing up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| neighborhood commercial, and this area as well is showing up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| However, only a small portion of those neighborhood commercial areas have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| actually been developed as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| This is where the Weigels is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| This is the existing land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| So this is what uses are currently on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| This is an aerial map showing, again, the current Ball Camp Pike and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| the Shod Road sort of improvements would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| A portion of this property was acquired during the right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| for Shod Road, which is why you sort of see this little portion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| And this is what the Shod Road project phase two and three for Ball Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Pike looks like in relationship to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| The roadway is expected to be widened to a 12-foot travel lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| separated by a 30-foot raised median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| It's also noted that there should be a 4-foot bike lane, curb and gutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| turn lanes at key intersections, and 5-foot sidewalks on both sides of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| There are also intersection improvements proposed at Daybreak Drive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| Hitching Post Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| It's our understanding that the preferred access would be off of Hitching Post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| Drive, but, again, that's not conditioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| And if you want to see what this looks like and the Shod Road improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| this is an aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I think we saw a presentation last agenda review or a few agenda reviews ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| about the Northwest Connector that the county has undertaken with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| Tennessee Department of Transportation, I believe, as well as CDM Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| This is a visual that they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| You can see the neighborhood that is across from the soccer fields called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Nicholas Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I believe you've received some communication from folks in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| And then this area is where the proposed neighborhood commercial area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:46| So staff is recommending to approve neighborhood commercial because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| forthcoming Shod Road improvements at this location and to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| neighborhood commercial zoning because the Shod Road improvements with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| sidewalks make this location more accessible to pedestrians from adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And in this little screenshot here, you can see that there is a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| criteria for neighborhood commercial that talks about not being within a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| mile of existing commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I've done a just quick estimate of the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So from where the proposed neighborhood commercial area is now down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| Weigels, it's about .4 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And then up to the intersection with, I think, Byington Solway, Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Pike, it's about another half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| So the neighborhood commercial zone district is designed to be a place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| provides options for limited retail and service uses convenient to and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| disruptive with established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| It is intended to provide for reoccurring shopping, personal service needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| nearby residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| So use is permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| However, next month I believe you will be seeing a use on review application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| for this area and a lot of the community comments we've been hearing are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| reference to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And it is primarily noted that a restaurant or a food truck park would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| considered a use on review at this location primarily because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| potential impacts to adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Liz, I haven't lived right across the street from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| I've had some feedback from my neighbors, as you well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| One of them being my dad and his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| The big issue I think that I see is right now they have a gravel road tying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| in to Ball Camp, which is right across the street from Daybreak and right near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Can we condition this to having the access from hitching post?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| Is that something we can do in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| I'm not sure where the county's law department is on this given there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| But you can condition in the county is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| They discourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| But in the city you cannot condition rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| But in the county we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Well, it makes sense for them to do it off hitching post anyway because it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| be far easier for people to get in and out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| And I realize that's probably the use on review part of what we're doing as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I think that would be more appropriate in the use on review stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Liz, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| How do we get a private piece of property zoned open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| That's typically reserved for public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| Is that an oversight that was just done years ago or was it originally part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Why was this private property part of the open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Normally we don't have private properties designated for open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| And I mean the park itself is zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| So we have a lot of parks that are used for public purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| I think this ASO field may actually be owned by the ASO corporation or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| ASO organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| which may be why it actually is zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| But the sector plan noted that the current use is a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| So it shows it as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| And then this little section may have originally been planned to be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| maybe future park extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I'm not entirely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| If it were given any other classification in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| neighborhood commercial or low density residential would probably be what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| sector plan would have shown given the existing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| It looks like the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| the park itself is owned by the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| I think Mr. Schubert donated that years ago when he built trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I've got a little bit of a different take on this, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| I know we looked at the zoning a couple months ago off of Woodland or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| somewhere over there where some guy wanted to do a car lot and then wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| to rezone to something that required you to be on a main arterial in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| to get the use done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| And I know this is a little bit of a different way to get to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| but to give somebody some commercial type use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| I think we'd want to feel good about the access in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| So I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Snowden's sitting back there and I know we've got a long agenda and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| stuff to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| but I'd want at least some sort of assurance from the county that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| don't have any issues with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| I think it could be cool where it's located and the concept and it kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| feels right in between those nodes that Liz was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| But if anybody has any aspirations of having access off of Shod Road and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| get into going past the park and traffic and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| I'd want somebody to have a decent feeling about the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| would you step up please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Your comments would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Thanks, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Just a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| There actually was a house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| It was originally a single family home that the Goins owned and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| relocated them in about 2003 or 2004 for the road expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Certainly I would like to limit our access points along the new roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| That's something we've been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| we anticipate this road to carry, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| in excess of 30,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| We don't want to, you know, have a lot of access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| My only concern is I don't know the width there at Hitching Post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| so there may be a constraint there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| but certainly I share in your concerns and we would like to provide them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| access to that side street if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| So do you guys just have the right of way on the old Hitching Post and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| where the new Hitching Post is and that's somebody else's property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| between because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| even the access point coming back and tying into Hitching Post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| it's kind of a funky intersection going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| Yeah, are you talking about, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| Not up at the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| To the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Yeah, if you went all the way down, whoever's got the cursor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| back down to where it ties in with the new alignment of the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| Oh, right to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| That triangle there is owned by Mr. Gard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| So I guess my point is for that commercial traffic right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| it'd have to go down to that Y and somehow that would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| reconfigured I would suspect to make all that work with the park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| commercial traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Yeah, I would assume, Mr. Gard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| that there would probably be some interest in closing that right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| eventually too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| So, yeah, there are a lot of complicating factors there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| but I share in your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| I think it's something we need to take a real close look at for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Yeah, so that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I'd like to have somebody tell me from the county that they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| something worked out before I'd want to give commercial access off of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| closed side road with no access on to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| I don't know how you could actually close that right away because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| two pieces of property that would have no access to anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| Correct, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Yeah, we would require the adjoining landowners either agree to or provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| some sort of private access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yeah, we'll dig into that, Commissioner Ooten, and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Liz, do you think that this would, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| become another neighborhood commercial node with multiple properties going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| neighborhood commercial, changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| or is this just, you think, just a standalone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| I mean, I think that this location could be a neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| It is probably not the correct description for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| but I guess I see a neighborhood commercial sector plan designation at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| this location appropriate given the location and the major improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| that are happening related to the pedestrian network there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I was going to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| This is the new road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| and it looks like this property has a turn lane going right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| If you're going west, is that a turn lane that would be the only place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| you could turn left to go is right into this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Obviously, we spaced those turn lanes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| or median openings to accommodate for public road streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| and then that turn lane there is not necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| it's obviously you can turn in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| but it's more for U-turn access for folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| because obviously there's going to be a lot of right in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| right out locations, so we did accommodate for U-turns in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| No, I mean, this is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Like, in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| you would not want that property using that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| and that turn lane for access, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Or you would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| It's certainly not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We would like to provide them alternate access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| that doesn't involve them coming out there at the median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Is there any buffering plan for protection for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| that's right across the street from this potential see-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| So there are some landscaping standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| when you are adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Pay no mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2860)|
| 0:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I'm just concerned that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| everything that you described with the bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| and the kind of commercial that would be there in the see-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| that all sounds really great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| but then I look and there is all this open space park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| meaning people not living there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| and then right across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| there's a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| that will now have a really large road in front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| and commercial encroachment, which worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| So there are some landscaping standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| and the neighborhood commercial zone district allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| or requires that the building be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| no more than 5,000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| So it is a more reduced commercial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| That is kind of, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| the nature of neighborhood commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| is that they are adjacent to low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| residential land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| I think this piece of property has got some real challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| not only the access issues, but just the overall dimensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| a tough piece of property to try to develop on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I would like to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I'm sorry, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I can't quite hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I think this is a challenging piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| and with the issues with the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| that have not really been resolved yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| maybe this ought to be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| for at least 30 days for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I was also going to ask what the setbacks were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| but I think I saw, was it 20 feet or is it 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| since it's sort of adjacent to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Let me toggle back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| I know that you mentioned a restaurant or a food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| but I don't think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| to mention a restaurant or a food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| but I don't know if this is developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| for any use under neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| because it's like 0.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And then for parking, no matter what the business would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| I just don't know that there's enough space, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| for anything to really happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| So we do have a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| that has been submitted for the July meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| for planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| And the applicant has submitted a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| showing how they would make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| for their proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I'm sure staff will have a number of comments on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| related to whether or not they're actually meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| the standards of the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| So, I mean, you know, shy of being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| to produce a site plan for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| You know, I don't know that I could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| that you couldn't fit something on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| I think there's an ability to be pretty creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| when it comes to some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| So just thinking through, just listening to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I think one of the things that I agree with you, Pat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| that we might need to look at a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I don't know if 30 days would be enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| because as I see it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| right now they could potentially be connecting to Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| That will eventually become shod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| A building is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| and then now they don't have access to that other side road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| So I think all of that needs to be taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| before we really do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| to make sure engineering and the county road department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| has all of that worked out with this property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| just to make sure everything works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| for what's going to be coming in in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I mean, county's spending a lot of money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| I assume the state is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| And I hate to see us create a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| even before the road's even hardly finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| It's not finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| I mean, I drove out there this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and if you haven't been out in that part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| it's really a phenomenal project going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Everybody needs to get familiar with the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| Staff will have some additional internal discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| with Mr. Snowden in advance of our Thursday meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| based on these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| Any other comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Okay, thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| We'll move on to your next item, which is number 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| agenda item 6E21RZ, our file number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| It also includes a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| This is the east side of Marietta Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| northeast of Buttermilk Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| and south of Hardin Valley Road, and north of Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| So the applicant is requesting to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| from agriculture and hillside protection on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| to low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| and hillside protection on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| They're also requesting a rezoning from agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| to planned residential up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| This property is located in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| There has been some rezoning activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| recently in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| granting zoning up to 2.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| This is adjacent to some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| I believe a roundabout is proposed in this general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| as part of this subdivision that's forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| This is the sector plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| You can see, again, some of the LDR designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| However, since this is in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| staff recommends rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| rather than low-density residential for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| This site is also slope-constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| And there is some build-out that's already occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| across Marietta Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| And this is the aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| So you can see that it was previously some pasture land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| And this gives you a more clear indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| of the steepness of slopes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| So the red areas are greater than 40% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| and the pink areas are 25% to 40% slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And then the green areas are 0% to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| So when we did the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| for this 93-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| it shook out to 1.57 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| as the recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| So staff is recommending 1.6, just rounding that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| The applicant, again, has asked for two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| This shows what all the building permits are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| for the last three years in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| The yellow represents single-family detached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| The red represents commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| And the orange represent multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| The gray dots are demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| And the black star shows where this property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| relative to these building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Just as a point of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| our latest development activity report noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| that in the Northwest County sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| we've had the highest amount of residential building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| in 2020 for all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| in this Northwest County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| So there is quite a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| in development out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| This is the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| that has been brought up on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and there is actually a recommended improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| for Marietta Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| to include an additional shoulder width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| for users along Marietta Church in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| We have received a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| We didn't receive this until May 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| and we asked them to look at it a little bit more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| However, they submitted a revised traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| There are basically just some differences, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| in the data that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| However, their conclusions and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| in both of these letters don't differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| So that's what I'm showing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| and what we've referenced in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| So again, staff is recommending rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| because it's consistent with the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| since this is in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| and we are recommending 1.6 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| because it's consistent with the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And as we've noted in many of the other rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| that have happened in this general area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| there has been some expansion of wastewater capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| as well as some forthcoming electrical line improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| that are being proposed by West Knox Utility District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| and TVA for this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| You know, this area has sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| In rural residential, I thought you could go up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| if you're extending the LDR or you're adjoining that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| And why on the slope calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| do we start at two units an acre on the 0% to 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| It just seems an impossible place to start on a flat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| You're never going to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| So it is in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| and Marietta Church is a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| I believe the language in the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| talks about adjacency to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| This is quite a bit of distance away from the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| so it's not quite as close to the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| like we've seen for the areas along North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| where those are also in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| And I know we used the same density recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| of two trillion units an acre for those flat areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Now, across the street, wasn't that at a higher density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| So their overall density recommendation was 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| So across the street, 2.8, but here, 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| Yes, and it's a much larger site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| that seems to be more topographically constrained than that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| What method do you all use to decide what you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| Like, how do you decide at zero to 15%, I'm going to use two units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| I mean, how do you come up with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Because it seems to be different on different sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| I actually asked that question last week with Amy to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| because I think historically we were taking the maximum density allowed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| We're putting on the flat part, which would usually be around five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| and then reducing it for the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| And in the last three or four meetings, we've used two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| for just about every slope analysis we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I've got that same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| I think it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I think it's something that I would like for us to take a deeper dive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| in one of our quarterly work sessions that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| or just information sessions to talk about how we've done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| and how it's changed over time and just how staff looks at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| Because, again, in the county, we're just using this as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| And, you know, when staff is looking at, they look at the surrounding density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| and they look at the, you know, that's just one of the factors is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| but also just generally what has been going on in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| Liz can probably articulate this a little better than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| but in terms of how she did it for this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| But I do think that we need to really hone in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| How do we want to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Again, the intent of the hillside and ridgetop plan wasn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| addressing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| It was addressing how do we protect these steep hillsides, these ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| and not specifically limiting, you know, the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| But this is the tool we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Again, and staff just uses it as a guide to help us make our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| But I do think it deserves additional attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| and something I think that we should talk about as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| I think that, you know, the development community has no interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| unless they, you know, did something crazy to damage a hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| because they can't get any yield out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| But I know when a couple of years back when we used to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| get density generated off of our hillside calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| we were not disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I mean, it was more realistic than I think it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| I think it's coming in low consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| because I remember that top line number was five units an acre on the zero to 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| but then you get cut way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| And when you took that as an overall average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| it was a pretty realistic number about what you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| and have a nice development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| And so my concern is that that flat area number is so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| I mean, I don't see how you develop any property with the cost the way they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| at that kind of low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| I'd like to chime in a little bit on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| because hillside protection has been something that I've been paying a lot of attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| through my time on the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| And I think that I, in some ways, agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| I think that if we have flat portions having higher density, the air is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| I think the limit of disturbance on the hillside is more important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| in terms of what we look at, paying attention to how much of that hillside remains intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| both from a visual aesthetic of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| and then perhaps there is great density on the flat portions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I have two additional observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| One is, and I'm echoing, I think, one of the commissioners earlier had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| well, this may be up to, but what is the actual build-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And I think that we sometimes will look at, for example, the PR across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| which is up to 2.8, but that doesn't really indicate that that is what it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| or will be developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| And then another topic, perhaps, for a quarterly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| which rises with this discussion, is we're kind of in a pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| Because we say, let's give the developer the maximum and see what they can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| But then when they come in with their actual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| and there's been quite a bit of money spent on designing and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| there's a reluctance to say, no, this isn't what really fits the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| because of the expense and time that has been incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And if there was some way to have a middle ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| where we could have a vaguer layout concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| that doesn't involve the expense and the detailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| so that the planning commission could feel more comfortable tweaking it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| I think that might be something worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| Well, just based on everybody, I mean, this came up in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| It's now come up in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| So since July is the beginning of a new fiscal year and a new quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| can we have this discussion with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| and kind of get a better understanding for our first quarterly in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3839)|
| 1:04:09| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I'm going to switch computers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Mike's going to take over the next three agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Give him a minute to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| And again, going back to this discussion about the hillside and ridgetop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| the slope calculations that we do, again, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| those are just a tool that we use as part of our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| Amy, in just about every case, though, we've used your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| as based upon just the hilltop, ridgetop calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| It doesn't really take into account the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| Agenda item number 22 is 6A21C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| It also has a use-on-review associated with this Bakertown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| I just wanted to bring this one to your attention because it is a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| more unique than what we've seen in the past because we have a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| and a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| The area for the concept plan is just the development itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| where they're developing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| The use-on-review portion of this project is actually encompassing two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| other existing developments south of Bakertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| So this is up in, again, this is near the Shod Road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| That portion is not complete yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Ball Camp Pike is on the south side of the property and Ball Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| north of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And Middlebrook is off to the west a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| So I just wanted to step you through what we're looking at here and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| happened because it is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| We haven't really received too much comment on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| so it's not necessarily a controversial project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| but it is just a unique one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Back in the mid-2000s, the property south of Ball Camp Pike was rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| planned residential, and when they went through use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| they actually, it's at four dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| planned residential at four dwellings per acre is what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| They built it less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| And they noted on their plan that the density is going to be transferred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| this property, which at the time was not zoned planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| but it was owned by the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Next year, this property was rezoned to planned residential and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| property just north of it was rezoned to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Eventually, that planned commercial property will be developed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| It's not part of this project, though the planned commercial zoning portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| and the planned residential, what we're discussing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| are technically on the same parcel at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| so they are the same property, but we're only looking at the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| So this is a situation where we're transferring density from the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| development to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| So the density of this project is 8.05 dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| which is more, obviously, than the PR at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| That's physically on the property, but like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| we're transferring density here, so they're still within their density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| limits for the overall planned residential zone in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| If this was not owned by the same person when the properties were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| originally developed, we wouldn't allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| We wouldn't allow somebody just to, some other third party to come in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| rezone this planned residential and transfer density from a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| development over to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| But because of the sequence that happened here and the documentation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| happened, we were able to agree that that could work here in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| And I'll show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I added, I'm not sure if I have the right information up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| but there is a, on the staff report, there's an appendix B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| I think it's appendix B that outlines and shows where that note was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| old concept plan that showed that they were going to be transferring density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Just so you know, I'll go back to the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| What you're seeing on this portion of the plan, so this is the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Let me put on the larger hand here so you can see what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| This is where the townhouses will be attached to units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| This planned commercial shown here with the conceptual commercial layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| has not been submitted by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| That could change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| It could be rezoned to something else and be done, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| it could be a totally different project than what we're seeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| They are showing a connection to that, a road connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Let me zoom out here so you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| So road B here is connecting into the commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| There will be sidewalks and development along Bakertown, along road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Road A stub outs into the adjacent subdivision to the east that is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| construction now we approved earlier this year with that same road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| So we're getting the interconnectivity that we want to see which is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| and the location for attached units makes sense being right behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| commercial, future commercial development where we assume and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| also a railroad track just to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| I didn't want to really go too far into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| I just wanted to give a little quick explanation of how we got to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| density that we did on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| So you're transferring density across the railroad tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| The railroad tracks bifurcates those two properties, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| The railroad tracks and Ball Camp Pike, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| And the sector plan does support the density too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| It's in a mixed use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| It does allow consideration of medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Let's move on to agenda item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| This is 5H21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Jennifer Moore-Pitts, recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So this is the recovery housing project that we saw a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| For those members that weren't here, the property just to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| the 8537 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| So this is out in the Carter community out in east Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Just zoom out real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| This is Carter Elementary to the south of Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| And the high school and middle school are off to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| The property to the east is already zoned OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| And the subject property is going to be considered for rezoning this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| at county commission to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| which is required to allow the consideration of the use on review for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| This is being considered as just one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| I know we've received a lot of comments on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| It's a confusion on exactly what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| In April, when we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| when the planning commission approved the use on review for the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| property, it was for 40 residential beds or clients at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| And this current application says the same thing because it's one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| It's 40 people total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| So the applicant provided a letter and it's in the app and the agenda that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| clarifies that, you know, this is just 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| It's not 80 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| And they do currently intend to split those residences up between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| sites where the people will sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| They will use both locations either as offices and residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| or they intend that this subject property will also be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| classrooms as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| So I guess, does anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| Mike, what is the definition of recovery housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| As I read through what the applicant has submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| it seems to be more of a religious faith-based approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| No clinical psychologists, counselors, no medical treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:25| I mean, this is, and, you know, we've all been, or not all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I guess, but many of us have been affected by the opioid issues and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| drug issues and the alcoholism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| And I'm not saying there's not a need because there is a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| I wish it were as easy as faith-based being the sole reason for curing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| I don't think it's quite that easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| but I do have an issue with how we view these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, it's, there's really, we're not under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| there's no control on these facilities at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| So I don't know how we deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| So recovery housing is defined as housing for six or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| limited to, with no limit on length of stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| that is occupied by the target population as defined below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| and that is linked to on- and off-site services to assist the recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| housing residents in retaining the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| improving his or her health status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| and maximizing his or her ability to live when possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| work in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| So it is a pretty broad definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| They fit within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| They're going to be helping people get back on their feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| and their program is targeted to be a one-year program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| so people would stay there for quite a substantial amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| go through and complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and hopefully get back on their feet and live on their own and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| productive residents of our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| So they fit pretty squarely within what recovery housing by definition is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| There might be other, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| state licensing that this is similar to but not really part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| And I think this is where, in the supplemental regulations for recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| housing, there's a statement in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| And this is something I can try to verify with the state before Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:32| It requires that they get to the part where it says it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:44| That the facility and use should comply with applicable county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| state, and federal codes and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| The applicant shall provide a letter of certification of final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| from the state or a letter from the state saying how the proposed use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| such that the state does not require a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| I think the challenge we've had in the past on similar cases is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| state really doesn't provide that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| And so if they're not required to get a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| they don't really have an opportunity to get a letter either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| But I can try to confirm with the state of whether or not that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| something that technically they can provide or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| I'd ask Amy to check into maybe one of our work sessions to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| director of the Knox County Drug Coalition speak with us and kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| go over some of the standards, requirements, what they see as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| So you're saying if we approved this and they didn't have this letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| certification, ultimately they wouldn't be able to operate as a recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| house, is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I don't think we're sure that it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| We're not sure it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Is that correct, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Well, my other question is can we, I guess since it's a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| we can legally use this criteria in making our decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4563)|
| 1:16:12| I mean, you can deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| You don't think that the use is appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| That's within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| What I'm saying is if we do think the use is appropriate but we don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| it's appropriate, if it's not certified, I don't know how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| I'm not articulating very well what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I understand what you're saying, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| We said, okay, maybe this is a proper place to have a recovery place for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| drug use but we prefer it to be a medical slash professional organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| Is that something we can consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| I guess can we make that a, can that be part of what we're saying has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| in place before we approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| You're saying that essentially the absence of the letter of certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| could that be a condition or a basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I'm happy to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| I think it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| I would say how would the use be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| I mean, when you think about use, a paint store or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| maybe they have different methods but the function of what goes on in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| should be pretty close to the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| So I would say there wouldn't be a lot of difference in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| There is a difference in drug treatment facilities versus recovery houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| And they're very specific and much more stringent on drug treatment facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| And that's why I think having Karen Pershing from Metro Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| come and speak to you all would be very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I'm no expert on that but she did, her and I spoke at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| There are very specific requirements if they are going to be administering drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| and it also depends on the type of drugs they're going to be administering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| So there's a number of different layers to these types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| But on this use, if we approve this, could they go convert to that other use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| without further coming back and asking permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| So they could go from a recovery place to a drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| That's a part of the condition that I would like for her to look at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| I know city building codes, if you have a change of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| you're technically supposed to go through a change of occupancy permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| so the fire folks will know who the resident of the building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| or the tenant is or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So we could put some sort of change of occupancy condition on the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| to say whoever the new operator is or whatever they're doing has to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| And it could be a staff approval if it's a like-kind use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| And if you guys deem that it's something a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| from a nuanced standpoint of the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| then you can make them bring it back through commission or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| I feel like on a previous case in, what was it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| northeast Knoxville close to the Carnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| they were admitting people that were clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| and that was a question that was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| If they chose to make it a drug facility, would it have to come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| And I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| And I think this also, I guess what everyone's kind of talking about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| what does the state define as a recovery house and drug facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| Because that would determine whether they need a letter, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| That's correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| My guess is that the state's going to look at it more in the medical side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| If there's actually drugs being administered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| then you're going to have to have licensed professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Would that be correct, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| My question, and it may just summarize everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| is I'm not really quite sure what they're exactly doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| And I have the confidence at this point that they know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| I'd like to know a little more about their professional background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Even though it's a recovery house and it's faith-based approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| there's still going to be a lot of psychological issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| I just am not sure what they're doing and if they know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| And my question was whether a use-owner review would require a floor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| because right now it's just letters describing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| but we've seen cases where it was less of a strict facility, like in the Carnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| and they provided a floor plan showing those beds and bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| So I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| We can request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| I'm not sure how that's going to really impact a decision personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| how they plan to lay out where they sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| I don't know how that really changes what their mission is and what their operation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4853)|
| 1:21:02| I was reading what they had submitted in terms of what they'll be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| For example, on Friday and Saturday, outreach away from center, fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| So, I mean, two days out of the week, they're away from the center, fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| To me, that doesn't sound like a treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| Can I ask one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| As I was reading through these comments, did we approve the adjacent property for this already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| Is that right, in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Is that what that says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| The Planning Commissioner approved a recovery house for the same operator at the adjacent property to the east in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| So part of this is already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| They're already functioning on the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| This would just add a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| Yes, that's my understanding that they're functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Is that Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I'm not sure if they're actually there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| I don't know if that's because they had to do some renovations of that space to make it a living space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| It's an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| They were moving into the basement of the office building, so they had to do some renovations to make it a residence type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| I'm not sure if that has been completed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Commissioner Smith, I recall this session, and there was some urgency expressed by the applicant for a need for having a decision made that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4946)|
| 1:22:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| That I think pressed the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| I recall that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| It had something to do with the sector, that whole area we were trying to – never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| Well, and there's been a couple other instances where – and I just want to make sure we're kind of treating them all the same so I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| I think it was Acadia Health that had one out in the Reddit community that was heavily scrutinized when we looked at making sure that it had fences to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4978)|
| 1:23:09| And, again, that was a voluntary treatment center, but we made sure it had fences and things around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| Then we had the one from Angelic Ministries out on Zion Lane that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| So we just need to make sure that we're looking at all of these on equal footing and not treating them differently because if we're going to require fences for one and not for the other, we're starting to treat things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=4999)|
| 1:23:30| So I think we just need to kind of go back and look at – to make sure we're following the same plan for all of these type of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| If we're going to ask the state, what are your requirements, I think we've got to also decide what do we want to see for facilities like this to protect neighborhoods around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5016)|
| 1:23:46| And that's sort of what I meant as far as a floor plan, not that it would necessarily change our decision, but just the level of submission and what we're seeing for each facility be kind of equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5026)|
| 1:23:56| I only have one contrary point to that, Commissioner Smith, and that is that each site is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| So where one may be in the center of a residential – established residential neighborhood where a fence may be more sensible and give people more comfort about living right beside that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5043)|
| 1:24:13| a facility that is in a more commercial zone that doesn't have those residences right around it, it may be fine for it to not have that kind of fencing or architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5053)|
| 1:24:25| So I agree with you in general, but –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| And I think that's why – because when you look at this, this one's within less than a mile from, I think, an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| So it's close to a lot of schools in the area, so it may not be necessarily plopped right in the middle of a residential, but it's close enough that I think we ought to consider those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5072)|
| 1:24:42| Again, I don't have the perfect answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| There's no one-size-fits-all, but I think we need to, as a commission, probably look at what are the parameters we want to put around it so that if X, then Y, if Z, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:54| here's what the people who want to open these know to follow and what we're going to be looking for instead of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| Let's throw something against the wall and hope it sticks this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| And to that point, I'm very interested in what Ms. Blakeney finds in terms of what is required, because I think this one really does introduce some vagaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5103)|
| 1:25:19| My question is, are we talking about the same uses when we're comparing these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| Because I think Zion Lane was classified as something other than a recovery house, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| So let's be careful that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| I think those two cases we're talking about, people were clean, so to speak, when they were going in there, and it was voluntary, whereas that's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5135)|
| 1:25:44| But under their zoning, they also had limitations on occupants that was less than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| So it leads me to believe that we have two different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Commissioner Hill, do you remember what the one on Zion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| It was a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Boarding house, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| And this one is similar to the other recovery houses in that people are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| There's no court order to come here, they're already clean before they come, they've already gone through a program, so it's not a detox facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| It's a facility to help people get back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| And to continue that rehab, recovery process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| Before we proceed, I know that former Commissioner Anders would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5189)|
| 1:26:37| We normally don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| We normally hold public comments until the regular meeting, Herb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| That's up to the commission if they want to hear from Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| I'd like to hear what Herb said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Herb, you'd like to step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| May I ask a question first, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| A legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| It was my understanding that the pre-agenda is not a part of the official record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| We don't keep a minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| So anything talking amongst the planning commission is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| But if we start...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| I'm not disagreeing, I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| If we take testimony and it's not a part of the official record, which is, I guess, created Thursday, then what is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5239)|
| 1:27:32| And I'm sorry, I've got to run, but to Commissioner Korbelick's point, I wouldn't have a problem hearing from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| but I would want it to be known that I would expect him to come back Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| and make the same comments on the record that he would make today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Just so that, again, it's following, getting everything on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| so that from the public's perspective, there's nothing that's being done that would be perceived as inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| We're still in a notified public meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| But, I mean, Commissioner Korbelick makes a good point in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| That's the reason that we don't take public comment during these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| And it is recorded, and it's made available later to the public through CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5287)|
| 1:28:15| I'm not necessarily opposed to his comments, but I think if we're going to allow him to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| we need to allow public engagement moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| Really, we don't have time for that, and I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Why would we make an exception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| I'm not making an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| And, again, I will always welcome input from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| but I think it's highly inconsistent to let one, and then the next meeting we have, we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| this is not for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Council agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| It's Council's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Thank you, sir, for coming, and this is a public meeting, but this is a workshop style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| This is not deliberative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| This is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| But for comments from the public to be appropriately considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| it's my viewpoint that those should wait until the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| This is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| We've had the attorneys come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| We've had people just like the gentleman here that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| I'd like to make a few comments, and we've let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| It is not that we have never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| We've done it quite a bit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Understood, and there's certainly an opportunity for any member of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| to comment through the written process that would then become public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| and available for others to see as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| So that's Council's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Obviously, I'll defer to the commission how you want to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| but that would be my recommendation to establish a consistent policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| I didn't mean to make an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| The prior commissioner, and just out of respect for him, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| but I don't want to, you know, whatever, if you want to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| come back Thursday, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Thank you, but we really need to hold the comments until Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| I totally understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I would say one thing, that I would be available if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| So moving on to our last agenda item is number 29, 6F21UR, Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5423)|
| 1:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| So this one is a – I'm going to just kind of flip back real fast to the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| because it's easier to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| So this is a request for a dollar general store retail operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| in the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| This is – let me go to the – I just closed my map, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Oh, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| So this is in the Sturkey Hills, Sturkey Village portion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| This property – let me turn on the zoning map real fast –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| was part of the larger PR zone property that was developed for the Sturkey Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| and Sturkey Village residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| The PR zone does allow consideration of commercial when, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| when the planned residential area is at least 20 acres in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| and then for every 100 units you get an acre of commercial land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| And so for this 2.7-acre site, you would need 270 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| and I think they're somewhere in the 500-lot range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| somewhere around there in the Sturkey Hills, Sturkey Village subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| So they're well over the minimum number of residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| that would be required to have this size of a commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| at least being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| And the property is still owned by the same family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| that developed the residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| and originally rezoned the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| The property is actually –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| has the sector plan designation of neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| The planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| the zoning standards that it applies to are the shopping center zoning –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| the PR zone says the shopping center use and parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| So it doesn't really clarify exactly how much of the shopping center zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| standards should apply to this versus the planned residential zone standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| We kind of use the more restrictive when it comes to setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| and landscaping standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| and then we also took in consideration some more appropriate standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| just in general to make this more appropriate for the neighborhood area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| where it's located and be more cohesive with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| And so that's how we came to the site plan and development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| that we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| They are going to install quite a substantial amount of landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| around the external boundary of the site, around the parking to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| and along the rear property line, which does face a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| There is an old right-of-way that cuts between the Dollar General store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| location and the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| They're planning on keeping a good amount of existing vegetation back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| but if they cannot keep some of that vegetation for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| this is the type of plantings that they will go back with to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| at least some buffer, landscape buffer between them and the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| In talking to them, you know, part of what the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| also talks about is connectivity to the, I'm trying to find the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| I'll put you this one here, to the commercial area from the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| And so what they're going to do in discussion with county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| and our staff, we talk about installing a sidewalk along a portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| Dante Road on the south side of Dante Road and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| Fountain City Road, so it's the same road, just continued continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| of the same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| And the county will come in with some crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I think it was an arrangement, but that's still to be ultimately determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| exactly what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| It's not really relevant to our review how that gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| crosswalk gets installed, but they will install a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| from their property, from their internal sidewalk system to the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| of Dry Gap Pike here and then also install these sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| along the south side of the road to make those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| The south, so southeast of here, we had a development in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| that was required to install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| If it happens, I don't think it's actually started construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| or anything yet, but if it does get developed or when it gets developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| it will install a sidewalk from this point down to the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| and the Sturkey Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| So hopefully there will be a Greenway connection to this store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| eventually as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| Just a couple of conditions that staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5721)|
| 1:35:29| Just wanted to address real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| So there's two items, the signage and then the building design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| that staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| I'm just going to go to the image again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| It's the easiest one to look at here, the rendering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5740)|
| 1:35:48| The staff is recommending that the CN zone sign standards be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| And the planned residential zone really doesn't clarify very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| exactly which standards to be used for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| It points to the shopping center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| The shopping center zone sign standards are totally inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| for this kind of location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| And the planned residential zone sign standards don't address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| this type of development whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| It doesn't allow wall signage except for, like, numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| or, like, the name of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| That's something you see, like, in an apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| It allows community message signs that you would see in front of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| like, a park or a church that says, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| when your service is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| But it doesn't really address monument signs that you would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| for commercial development or a wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| So that's where staff is recommending at least the CN zone standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| be used for the monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| And then for the wall sign, recommending that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| So the monument sign, CN zone monument sign standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| it can't have internal illumination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| but it can have external illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| The CN zone does not allow any illumination whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| of the wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| But staff is recommending at least allow internal illumination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| of the wall sign and a 50 square foot maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| The CN zone has a 40 square foot maximum wall sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| and we can discuss the merits of 10 extra square feet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| If you want to, I don't know if it's going to really matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| Part of my recommendation is that if they do a box sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| which is kind of what's shown here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| the measurement is from the external outside boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| of that box sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| This channel letters is the aggregate total of the channel letter sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| like letters are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| So they might actually get a little bit more area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| if they use channel letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| But channel letters in general, in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| don't really have the brightness that a box sign does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| and is a little less, I guess, bright and noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5871)|
| 1:37:59| The other condition that staff has with regard to the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| these, it is a brick facade, which is an improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| to some of the other Dollar Generals we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| So this at least gets it into the ballpark of a residential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| or at least kind of getting a little less industrial look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| and more commercial and maybe near a residential design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| It's a pretty big brick area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| And if you've seen a brick area of this facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| it doesn't have any articulation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| It's just a flat brick area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| It can be a little bit imposing when you're near it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| and viewing it from afar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| So what staff is recommending is to go with a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| that at least has a little more material change to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| This is an example of what we're kind of going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| This was a Dollar General that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| in the city's planned residential zone a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| It does have these stucco panels in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| that helps break up the facade and give us some more texture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| But there's a lot of different ways that you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| the similar thing without doing this exact design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| But it's just trying to break it up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| to make it less flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| And that could be either the material change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| or some other kind of articulation change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| I have a question, too, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| Thinking back to the presentation that Ed McMahon gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| in the Urban Land Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| he talked about examples just like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| and that communities have typically their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| And you're starting to go through some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| My question is, does Dollar General have their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| A, B, C, D that they go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| And is there some that we're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Is there a version that we're not seeing yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| that's like X or Y that is more friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| to the rural environment that's around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| They're going to do what they need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| to get into a community that they want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| So I'm sure they do have their standard box doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| that they have pre-made and pretty much ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| that they can make quick modification to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| And then there's going to be communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| that have specific architectural standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| that they're just going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| specific modifications to their design for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| So that would be my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| When they have very specific design criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| they're just going to have to do a little bit more work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| to their base design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| So that prodding would come from the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| pointing back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| For the redesign, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Yes, but keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| you know how old our code is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| It's somewhat limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| There are things that are within our purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| and we can encourage them to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| but we have very limited in terms of the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| that we have to be able to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| The second question I had is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| can you go back to the map view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| and show where the other commercial entities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| I guess, closest to it within the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:23| So this is the existing land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| And again, so this is the property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| I'm going to go all the way to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| the Callahan intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| the Central Avenue Pike-Callahan intersection here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| There is a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| I really don't know off the top of my head what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| I think it's more of a car-related business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| I'll have to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| And then back towards Merchants and Cedar Avenue to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| And then to the north, it would be Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| So I guess Emory is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| the closest intersection with commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| And this is where...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| Is this the right spot here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Let me turn on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| So it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| I mean, my sense was that it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| I was just out there recently and looking at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| and it feels very rural, and then some residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| It doesn't feel commercial at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| And this would be setting a tone for the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| that would be developing around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| If there was going to be any future...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| But I'll just correct myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| So this is Beaver Creek Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| and then just to the north, that is Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| And this is where the Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| has a Dollar General Market store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| I don't know if you've seen any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| about how there's an Emory store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| and then there's one that's on Cedar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| That's a regular Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| The one up here on Emory is a Dollar General Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| which is more like a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| We're not rezoning this property to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| It's already allowed in the zoning already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| Right, it's using them for fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| Yeah, we're just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| is this a proper commercial use of this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| I think we had a similar deal a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| at Seven Springs on Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Isn't that where they did a Dollar General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Mm-hmm, and that's where that one Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| that I show as an example of the type of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| we're kind of looking for just to break up the façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| That's that one on Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| The R.B. zoning that is near here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| I'll just turn...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Let's see if I can turn on the topography map real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| That R.B. zoning's been there for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| It was there before this area turned to planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| and it's actually on the same property as, like, parcel as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| But I really don't know why they left it as C.B. zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| but it is part of a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| There is a cell tower on it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| but really that's newer, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| When they developed that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| that C.B. was actually on the frontage of Daney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Yeah, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| And Mr. Snowden and his predecessor, Mr. Weitrich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| moved all those road systems away from that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| to create that new little triangle intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| So it's really just replacing what was out there originally, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| And I think we're better for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| because now it's in a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| as Jeff and other commissioners were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| where we can get a little input in the architectural design of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| because it was zone C.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| They could just go pull a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| and wouldn't have any of this landscaping or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| So I think we ended up with a better project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| Yeah, and you can see that in the historic aerials back in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| I have several concerns that if I raise them now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| I hope that we can hear the applicant's response on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| I've been doing some research on Dollar General, Family Dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| and my concern, based on this sort of metadata, is crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| I understand that crime frequently is increased with these types of stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| It's been documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I would be concerned, and I'd like to know the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| that the applicant would be providing regarding crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| I'd like to understand how they intend to keep up with litter and trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| And I'm also concerned about the parking lot lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| Does the staff have a device that measures lumens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| I know we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| We don't, but maybe Knox County Codes does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| And I'm getting a nod from Mr. Snowden, so, yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| Okay, and do the standards that I know the city has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| do they apply to the county as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| No, the county has their own zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| with their own regulations, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| There is a lighting plan in the agenda package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| as well as their photometric, well, I guess it's, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| I think it at least shows where the light would shine on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| I can't remember if it's, like, a true photometric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| where it tells you all the foot candles on every part of the property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Mike, is there any way we could ask for, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| any kind of transparency on those walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| either in the front or on the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| I noticed that there's no windows other than the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| And one of the pictures you showed had, like, outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| Is that allowed also for that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| I'm trying to remember how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| If they didn't show it on their plan, I don't think we could allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| I don't think the, it would probably fall back to the SC zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| and what it permits, but if they don't show it on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| and it's not, if they had, like, a little rack out front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| for a short period of time and they brought it in at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| that'd probably be permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| I'd have to talk to the codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| and see exactly how that gets enforced or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| But if they set up a permanent outside retail area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| then that would probably be against their approval here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| since it wasn't shown on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| I concur with Commissioner Midas, her input about the windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| just having something that breaks that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| not even just the stucco panel, but some kind of glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| What are, how broadly can we place restrictions, Amy, on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6471)|
| 1:47:59| I've heard this vary from time to time on the use-home review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| What are our limitations when it comes to design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| I believe you all can, you can add it as a condition of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6491)|
| 1:48:29| That concludes the items that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| that we wanted to cover with you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| Yes, I had an item I wanted to bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| and it's a segue, actually, to Commissioner Hill's last comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| which is what is the breadth of our authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| And the case I'd like to bring up for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| is the breadth of our authority for the subdivision concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| An email was sent out, I think, last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| in which the various opinions were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| in our March pre-agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| and I personally am uncomfortable moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| with future decisions on subdivision concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| until we have an opportunity to discuss amongst ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| what we feel our breadth of authority is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| I won't get into the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| You all have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| It's just two conflicting views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| I can see merit on both, and so I'm all confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| and I'd like to see if the Commission would be willing to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| our breadth of authority for the subdivision concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| before we move forward with any future hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| on that kind of application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6585)|
| 1:49:59| Are you saying we would suspend any future reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| before we enter into discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| I don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| No, I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| My understanding is that this is a broad question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| and for us to fully understand what our authority is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| I would like to have a discussion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| and perhaps the different points of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| could be presented with the Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| We know that Mr. Wise felt that our authority was quite broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| and Ms. Brooks felt that it was more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| I respect both professional opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| I can argue, I don't know if it would be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| but I would argue pros for each or against each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| So I'm in pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| So I'll jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| I got your message, Commissioner Korbelik, right before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| and I think we have a new attorney who just joined us on June 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| and I was on annual leave last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| so I think if the Commission wants to have a discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| we'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| I've shared some information with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| and tried to give her some background to prepare her for that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| but I was only able to give that to her yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| so we haven't had enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| And if you're wanting us to weigh in and participate in that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| I don't think that we're prepared to do that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| but we'd be happy to do that at a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| I will take direction from the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Do you think that we could manage that future meeting discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| before a subdivision concept plan comes before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| We get those on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| I mean, you will have them before you this month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Are you talking specifically about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| I know that the Ruggles Ferry, Innsbruck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| is up for an additional 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| And so it's possible then that we could have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| before the July hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| Yes, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| That's all I was curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| So then would that discussion possibly be at, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| next month's agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| or would we be looking at that being a separate discussion scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| I mean, I know she just said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| so you might not have thought that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| I'd have to look at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| I mean, it's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Do you all want to have a special called meeting to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I don't think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| We can't make this meeting any longer than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| Yeah, because I don't want to feel like we have to, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| shorten it because we're trying to fit it in with an agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| So that's why I just thought I'd say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Like, maybe it is worth having a separate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| We're happy to schedule a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| but if you all are willing to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| I think it's really important that the entire commission attends that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| meeting, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| So it really depends on everybody's schedule in order to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| So we can send out, I can have our staff send out a doodle poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| I just wanted to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| I haven't had a chance to talk to us with Amy or other staff yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| but there are five G 21 you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| which is self storage on Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| There's been some additional discussions between the applicant and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| and some community members and the applicant has agreed to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| modifications to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| We might see a revised staff report with additional conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| but we need to talk whether we want to add those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| But so if you see something on that one, it's a revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| It's going to be based on what those discussions with the applicant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| the community were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| So I just want to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| So you weren't provided a new staff report out of nowhere and didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| any clue why you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| Thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| We're clued this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210608-agenda-review?start=6861)|
