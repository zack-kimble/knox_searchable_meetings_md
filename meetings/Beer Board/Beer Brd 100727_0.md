| 0:11:15| Can you repeat your name again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=675)|

| 0:11:25| Yes, she's not listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Her crew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| What's your relationship to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| I'm the office manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Mr. Swanson, I don't believe that the woman before us is on our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| When we issue a beer permit, does it need to be someone listed as an owner or a manager on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| or can it be an alternative person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| As long as the owners and managers who are listed have gone through the vetting process, it's not necessary that they be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| For them to appear before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| One of those persons does appear, if that's your preference, but it's not legally necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| It's unusual for us to see someone who's not been part of the application package. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| I'm sorry. I was mesmerized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| We're looking for a copy of sales tax registration and approval from the building inspector, fire inspector and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Further discussion on this application, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| I note on the records check from the police department, I don't think there's anything we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Swanson, but it's something that you all should be aware of and maybe deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| There was a significant amount of money in unpaid parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| She might want to deal with that quickly, yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| It won't affect this, but actually it indicates that her car is on the tow list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| So it's not a good thing to have happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I think she knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| So there's a motion to second. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Those the same. All right. If you'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=817)|

| 0:13:58| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=838)|

| 0:14:23| Mr. Palmer has not been in for processing, but Mr. Borsodi has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| We're waiting on a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| The sales tax registration, building inspector approval, fire inspector approval and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| That's my Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| The beer board has not been to issue permits until everybody's in for their records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| And since Mr. Palmer hasn't been in for processing, I'm going to move to postpone to our next regular beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| That's proper. Well, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| You're done with that. You sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Everybody knows this is to postpone to the next regular scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Is there any problem with Mr. Palmer doing his personal processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| Actually, there was a miscommunication between myself, Mr. Palmer, and Officer Freel, just when he was supposed to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| This is an exciting business because this is the old Knoxville Brewing Company that sat idle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| and these gentlemen have taken it over and are going to resurrect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| But I guess we've got to jump through the hoops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| So I urge him to get in and get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=939)|

| 0:16:16| I don't have the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=982)|

| 0:16:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Same condition, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| It's two separate applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Do you want to call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| I think we have to actually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| There's two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| So I would assume we want to take the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| I'll open the floor for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| I'll move to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1006)|

| 0:17:20| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Councilman Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I just want to understand that last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| I want to understand that last statement. We have to wait for the prior owner at that location to surrender the permit before we can issue a permit for that location? Is that the practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1045)|
| 0:17:38| Yes, sir. And I believe this African has the old beer permit and this may become a non-issue very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Okay. We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Any further questions saying no? All those in favor, aye. Aye. See and stay. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| Santa Fe, 3920 Asheville Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| Was that the old, that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Santa Fe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Mr. Chairman, we move this to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| It is the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| As I read this, this is one we've postponed twice already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| and they got a certified mail saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| be here tonight or else, kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| And we got a card back saying it was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| So you could let this one die or you could move it until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| No communication whatsoever as to why they're not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| Your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I guess we should defer it, but I wish we had a better reading on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| This building has been closed for some months, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| and it looks like from the packet we have that there was a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and everything else with substantial rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| If we could postpone it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I don't know, is there some contact information where we could call these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| I guess I'll get on the phone and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| We don't have a phone number for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| There is a motion on the floor to move this to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Do we want to perhaps withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| We have an administrative hearing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| So it's possible that this person shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| We're giving you the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| We'll move it to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| We have before you tonight the Public House Pub 212 West Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| They were approved subject to final documentation April 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and their 90 days is tolling away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| and we have asked them to come and address you about needing more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| Public House, I'm Laura Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| It's 212 West Magnolia, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| And we just have some construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Laura Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And we have construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We're moving forward every day a little bit, but we're not quite there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| I'll move to extend your deadline 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Will that give you enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Do you think you can do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Yeah, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Now we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Seeing no lights, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And then we have an administrative hearing this evening with Magnolia Quickmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1275)|
| 0:21:28| This is for anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| Three minutes of a name and question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Norman McKellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I'm an attorney here for Magnolia Quickmark, 3039 Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Here with Mr. Rohrer, who's the principal of Magnolia Quickmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| And you understand why you're here for the second citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| And, you know, this board would like to hear from you a plan, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| as to what the business or from the owner, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| and what the business has done to, you know, stop this, prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| This is the second citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| The first citation, the owner submitted a remedial plan, which was, quite honestly, insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Upon receiving the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Is that the same owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| For what it's worth, did that without the advice of counsel, brand new into the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| just trying to learn the ropes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Did not submit a good remedial plan, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We submitted a revised remedial plan after this second citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| which we hope is more sufficient for what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| We submitted six separate things that we believe will ensure that this will not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| All of these six have been complied with since the second citation was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Most importantly, and hopefully most effectively, is this Viage Verifier machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| which is one of these machines that's hooked up to the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| You have to enter in a birth date for it to even permit the sale of an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| In addition to that, it's a small shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| The principal operates 90% of the working hours there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| So he himself is in charge of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| But for the one or two part-time employees that work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| they also are going to go through training in addition to the other conditions that are set forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| The Viage machine, is this one of these that's just almost like a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| looks kind of like a credit card machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| and you punch in a number every time a beer sale shows up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| He's actually dealt with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And does it have an ability for you to go in at the end of the day and look at all the birth dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| I'm still trying to learn the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Really, I'm not sure if I can go back and check all that, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| It's probably worth checking with whoever you got it from to see if that's possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| because one of the things we'll hear from occasionally is people who will punch in their birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| If you'll speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| It's either where you can scan the card, the ID, or you can scan it or slide it, actually, through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| and it tells you all the information about the ____.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| They've got to have a barcode on their ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| That's actually a much better system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| So I'm reading in your plan that you purchased this machine after the first incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| but didn't start using it until after the second incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| I mean, we had it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I was trying to, like, really get it to work, get it hooked up to the cash register and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| and have a place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| But we didn't really use it until prior to that second ticket we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| And how often are you using it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I mean, we use it every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| I mean, you indicated a moment ago that it sounded like you weren't entirely familiar with how to use the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| And I think it's critical to this remedial plan that we understand that this is a critical part of your beer sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| a required part of your beer sales every time someone wants to purchase alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| And everyone in the store is trained to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I was just curious, following up on the machine, what ID has a barcode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| Your driver's license usually doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| What do you have to bring to make that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| It's you can, I mean, I'm not really familiar with the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| big difference, this machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| You can type in, actually, the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| But you have, it's what, we haven't had any issue to where really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| They do have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| I never noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| We never had any issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| All the IDs we checked, they had barcodes where either we slide it through the machine or we scan it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| So that has enough information to tell whether the person is 21 or not, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| The machine, what it does, it tells you the age of that person each time you slide the card, the ID, or you scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| It tells you how old they are, and it tells you all their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Is there something set up that flags and, you know, like a red light goes off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| or something says too young, or do you have to just pay attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| It will say underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| It will say underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| We didn't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Yeah, let me ask real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| The two incidences, we usually have something from KPD, but we don't today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Did the clerk get an ID on both of those and misread it, or what were the details on why the sale happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| On the first ticket that we got, actually I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I checked the person's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I just miscalculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| I didn't have the right tools, and I was by myself at the store, and I just didn't calculate right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| I thought he was going to be 22 when he was going to be 21, and I miscalculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| So it was an honest mistake, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| On the second one, it wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| The guy didn't do his job whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| He didn't answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| He didn't get an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| No, he didn't check ID, and that's how we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And I wasn't at the store at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| That person is no longer a full-time employee with the companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| If I understand correctly, you scan in to verify, but the register could go ahead and accept the sale without that scanning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| In other words, I could come up, and if you didn't ask for my ID, I could still purchase the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| When you ring it up as an alcohol sale, does it require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| It's required to show ID on the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| It will tell you to scan the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And it won't proceed until that scan occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| And I guess I'd like to follow up, too, on the statement that you made about the person's no longer employed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| I mean, really, that person can go right down the street and get a job doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| For the record, I already said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Well, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| And really, the business is responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Just because they fire somebody who can go right back down the street and get a job probably doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1733)|
| 0:29:02| that doesn't give me any reassurance that a good thing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| The front end of it is to train properly and to have the proper equipment in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| Now, I don't understand if you had it and it's this simple, why it wasn't being used immediately when you first got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| I mean, it's just beyond me as to why that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| But I just don't buy into the fact that somebody got let go and that it's like it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Well, it's a good thing only in the sense that this was an employee who was negligent and was terminated for his negligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| That person can go work someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| It's just that's not going to be tolerated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| The key is training the new employees, and that's what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Mr. Biden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| And I think, in fact, that we've been advised that employees who have made a mistake are sometimes better employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| because they've learned their lesson, they understand how serious it is, and they take extra measures in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| And I like the idea of this BIOS verifier machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| The places I've seen these operate, you know, that you punch in the right date of birth and it okays it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| And if it doesn't, you don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| And if you look at the ID and make sure it's not a fake ID, I think that pretty much solves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| But, furthermore, on number six down here, who's going to verify the manual log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I mean, you know, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| I've seen, I've heard businesses come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| It'll be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| That'd be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| And so you're going to take the responsibility to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| In this case, I think I can probably support you and hope we don't see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| And I think, you know, bringing an attorney up here and taking the necessary measures to convince us, you know, is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1848)|
| 0:30:58| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| Sir, any further questions or any further action to be taken on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| That brings us back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| Santa Fe Restaurant, 3920 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Anybody happen to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Councilman, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I will move that we postpone it one more time and then they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| There's three strikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I guess I think they've had their three strikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I'm willing to go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| If I hear something different we're going to do, then we've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| We've sent them certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| They haven't responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I like the idea of trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| This is an important location and, one, it would be good to get occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| Have you been to the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Is there ever anybody working there that you could talk to face-to-face and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| get after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| It looks shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I think the only step left is to try to call this Lilliburn, Georgia, address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and find out if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Will you try that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| I'll undertake to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Do we have a phone number on file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| We don't, but I would be glad to assist you to try to reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Yes, we'll make sure that that gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Ms. Martin, if I read your letter correctly, they have been scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| and not appeared at May, June, and now the July agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I cannot support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| There's no activity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I pass there quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| And I'd like to see some activity there, but it's just a vacant building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| It's just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And I don't see anybody there doing anything in many, many months, quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Do we have a second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| We've got a motion and a second to postpone until the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| Let's go ahead and do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Chairman Pablos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Five-three, it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Is there any other business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Actually, you should stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| We need to do agenda review, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100727?start=2031)|
