| 0:02:09| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of August 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Before we move on, I want to talk a second with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| We have a number of people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Eight people signed up on the Hollywood Drive rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Six are signed up to speak against it and two are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| And I want to call on Councilman Roberto for his recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Normally, as you know, we have up to three on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| And this is a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| We had a pretty robust discussion last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| so I think we should stay within the normal rules with three on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| and three off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| So given that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| then I'm going to list the names of everyone signed up to speak against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| it, the six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| And if you all would please just step out or right to the edge there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and decide among you who the three speakers will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| You'll have up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| So we have David Williams, Stacy Varon, Wanda Shimpa, Pat Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| Amy Midas, and Roberta Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| If you all would just please choose among yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| and then let us know who the three will be to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| The consent items are 11-0 through P, certificates of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| For the mayor's report, I first want to report back on two great events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| that Knoxville hosted last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| First, we hosted the fifth annual Cities United convening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| which brought together about 300 mayors, city leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| and youth participants from across the country to discuss ways to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| and reduce violence among young black men and boys who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| disproportionately affected by violence in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Avis Reed, our senior director of community relations, and her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| Tasha Harris, Kevin Perry, and Ola McBride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| did a truly outstanding job of working with Cities United to plan the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| conference, and we have to give a shout out to Visit Knoxville as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| who worked closely with us and the Cities United team to plan the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| and then also to help participate in various discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| We also appreciate our community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| who both attended different events and hosted site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| For example, participants went to the Phillis Wheatley YWCA, to the SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| offices, the Emerald Youth Foundation's Dale Avenue Soccer Complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| and got a preview of the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| All of these, the purpose of these site visits was to show how our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| organizations and facilities are providing mentorship, job training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and opportunities for recreation and just fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| I think everyone learned a lot. We learned from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| And the convening will help all of the participating cities as they refine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| and grow their strategies for building safe, healthy, and hopeful communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| So we put them on the planes basically on Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| and then we welcomed our sister city delegation from Muroran, Japan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| on Friday evening and hosted them for the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Again, I want to do really special thanks to our special events office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| who helped plan the activities for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| We've had a sister city relationship with Muroran for about 27 years now, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| They were also, one of the reasons why they came this weekend is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| they wanted to participate in the Knox Asian Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| which was held on Sunday at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| This was the fifth annual Asian Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Our Asian Festival is a great model for bringing together people from many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| different cultural backgrounds, and the festival promotes peace and unity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| and reminds us of all the great things that we have in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| But it also gives our Knoxville Asian Americans an opportunity to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| their unique traditions and cultural contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| So there was a lot of dance, art, music, and food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| It was a really great festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| We also were joined by the newly appointed Consul General of Japan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| who is stationed in Nashville, Mr. Hiroyuki Kobayashi and his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| They joined us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| So that was fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| We put our sister city delegates on the plane on Monday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| and they headed back to Muroran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I also want to take a moment to introduce Fiona McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| Please stand, Fiona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| She is our new Deputy Director of Communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Fiona will be joining Eric Vreeland, who, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| is our Senior Director now, and a really great city communications team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Some of you already know Fiona from her work most recently at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Knox County Health Department, where she focused on policy and planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and she often attended these meetings, city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| county commission too, I think, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Prior to that, Fiona has worked in positions in nonprofit management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| and she was the Senior Director of Operations at AC Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Fiona has a background in public policy at the federal level as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| local level, and we look forward to her being part of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=468)|

| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| So we'll start with the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Mr. Williams, do you want to tell me who from your group will be speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| We'll start with those who are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Let's first go to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| I'm not going to use five full minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| If I could divide it up with someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| But we're trying to pick the three now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| But I'm going to be very brief in my remarks, if that would be all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| If you do that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I'm going to be brief with my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I'm not going to take five full minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| And I can give my time to someone else, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Really what we do is you need to pick three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Pick three people and let me know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Okay, so we'll start with those that are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Mr. Shepard or Mr. Seymour, do you want to speak now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| or do you want to wait until council calls on you at the moment of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| Mayor Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| And by the way, notice up on the screen, council, thank you to communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| I no longer have to be the timekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| So we're testing this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| So you watch up here, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| You watch up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Is it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| And this way you can kind of monitor yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Hopefully it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I don't have to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Mayor, Mr. Shepard and I are here basically to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| But I did want to state that at the last meeting on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| we were asked if we could amend our request to RP1 on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| And after discussing it with Mr. Green and MPC and our clients, we have agreed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I'm going to go ahead and set mine just in case it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So we'll get back to that with the amendment then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| And there was one condition on the non-disturb area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| We have no problem with that, but somebody has cut a road into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| and we want to be able to grade it back to its natural contour without violating that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| So we'll let MPC think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| We'll get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Mr. Shepard, did you want to say anything now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| No, I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Do you want to tell me who's speaking on behalf of the FOMGAP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1211)|
| 0:20:38| And please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| And if you watch the timer, you'll see how you see the timer up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| And so we'll get that going once you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| My name is Pat Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Address is 800 Renford Road, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I guess I want to give you a little bit of history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| and just let you be aware that the FOMGAP community itself has been very well aware of this property for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| and has wanted to use it for the use of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| Back in close to the end of the 60s, the 70s, UT married housing was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| We realized that there was a big need for daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| We thought, what a great place to have a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| So not being very sophisticated but just trying to find out what we're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| we were told to go to see the Department of Engineering, wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We were advised by them at that time that that was called a natural drain field for stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| that it could not be altered in any way, and it could certainly not stand construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| We explained that it would be simply a one-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Now, there would be bulldozing done to flatten this area out, but it would not be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| It was a 2,500-square-foot building, one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| You know, a place for kids to be when it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Small kitchens and bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Nothing could be changed to that piece of property because it was a natural stormwater drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| A little bit later, we believed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| We went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Jim Miller bought that property and was told in advance that we had been advised this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| They said, well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| He rented it out to some people for a while that had plants in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| They sold plants annually and Christmas trees, and that was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Nobody cared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Then Dwight Church came by one day before sale was signed in the yard in that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| and he said he noticed there was a high point on that property that could be seen by I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| It would be great for a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| He buys all the property to get access to that billboard, which he's still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| and he's not part of the transaction he's now doing, he's now wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| He just went ahead and bulldozed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| There were ditches in that area deeper than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| Boulder was enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| This property is the bottom of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| There's a road behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| That water comes down that road, down that hill, into this property, into the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| It is historic, I guess, but the point is it was a structure designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Again, he just started bulldozing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| He was ultimately told to stop, but now he's got it for sale again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Two of us had been told that we could not rearrange that, that it was a natural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| it could not be messed up with, and in spite of the community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| that was just not something that could happen in that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I just want you all to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| If it is decided that indeed it's still not available for that kind of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| Pontiac community would love to have a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I know the UT Ag Department would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| I know Extension Service would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We'd love to have a community garden, maybe a place for the kids to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| and talk and play, a little playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| That little area needs a place for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| and we think that's a great place if it's determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| and if it's determined that it can't be used for this, the proposed service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| maybe Dwight Church would donate it for a tax write-off or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| He's making plenty of money off the top of the hill with what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| with his billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So that's just what I just kind of want to make sure that you all knew about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and what the rules have been heretofore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| unless for some reason it's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Who is the next speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Please state your name and address for the record and keep an eye on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| My name is Stacy Varon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| My name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Pull it towards you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| My name is Stacy Varon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I live at 617 Hollywood Road in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| right next door to the pond, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| We're very appreciative of the council's willingness to consider downsizing to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| We think that's a great step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Because of the constraints of the land, it is 5.11 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| but not only about half of that is actually buildable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Because of the sinkhole, because of the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| there's just not that much space to really build in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and that requires going up and up and up, story after story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| and that presents a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| We think it's too much density on that particular small piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and we would like to consider a height cap of 35 feet so that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| we still have something there, but it's not such a huge, huge eyesore in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| I think it's important to say once again that as pond gap people, we are the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| We are, a lot of us, low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| and we really don't have any kind of objections to low income or workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| or whatever we're calling it, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| We really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Our objections spring from traffic safety and a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| I know I sent an email to Andrew and copied the rest of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| so you can see in writing what a lot of our concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| One of the things that I didn't put on there that I meant to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| but I'm not sure who's in charge of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| and that is the problems that we've had with our water supply and our sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| Over the past three years, we've had 12 breaks in our water main and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| so KUB fixed it and fixed it and fixed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and finally they replaced a small section of it on the south side of the hill going to Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1641)|
| 0:27:33| but that's the only section that they replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| and I'm really concerned since the rest of it is still the same pipe that they had to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| We're concerned about adding so much volume to the sewer and also to the water supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| but I know that the city's not responsible for KUB and the builder isn't responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| so I don't know how those, can anyone tell me how those things get worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| or who we would want to contact about that or where that's handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| Please talk to Mr. Hagerman afterwards. He can talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| We would like to have a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| and we're particularly concerned about the egress-ingress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| where people are coming and going from that apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| It is a blind hill, and we really would like a study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| to make sure that people can safely pull out of there without getting T-boned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| If possible, we'd like to see a turn lane so that it doesn't back traffic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Again, people who are going, I'm sorry, my northeast-southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| people who are going from Sutherland towards Paper Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| they're going to go over a blind hill and come up to where that turn is for the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| and we're concerned that if someone is, if it's stopped so they can make a left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| you won't see it until you come over the hill, and that's a big safety concern for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| so we would like someone to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Sidewalk improvements, and I went back and did some more research on the retaining walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| since there seems to be questions from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I found in 2016 that the city sent the owners, I don't know what you call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| an order to fix the wall, and you saw by the pictures it's not been done in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| So we still have those concerns, whether it's the city's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| or the owner's responsibility, we just want it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| So we'd like to see, however that works, we'd like to see people follow up on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| and make sure that it's actually being corrected before we have lots of kids walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1785)|
| 0:29:54| The preservation of the pond in some way, I've read a lot, I've read quite a lot about storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| and how all that works, and I've read different things about whether it has to be fenced in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| or not fenced in, or I don't know how all that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| If it does end up that it has to be fenced in, we'd like to request a decorative metal fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| and not just a chain link thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you very much, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| David, who is your third speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1826)|
| 0:30:44| Hello, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Do you see the timer above there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| I can keep an eye on it until you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I'm Wanda Shinpaw, and I live at 4305 Lemoore Road in Hollywood Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| and my main objection to the apartments are that we have many apartments in that area already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1859)|
| 0:31:10| The traffic is horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| If you've ever traveled in the morning or the afternoon trying to get in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| I don't even go out until all the traffic's gone in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| and then it's hard for me to get out of my subdivision because I have to come out onto Hollywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| and there's no lights, and I live on a hill going up Hollywood to Lomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1892)|
| 0:31:42| We have South College there that turns, they go through Lomas to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1902)|
| 0:31:51| We have apartments, and we just have too much traffic already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| If you've ever driven there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| If you haven't, come and I'll go with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| But I really think that people should think about we're not against the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1925)|
| 0:32:15| We're against more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| There was a wreck at Sutherland and Hollywood yesterday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| and so that is my objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| And we don't have any sidewalks in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| There is no sidewalks on Lomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| and children that live in that area, they either have to get somebody to take them to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| or they have to walk because they cannot ride a bus if they live within a mile of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| And we have two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| We have Pond Gap, and then we have West High School that runs off of Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| And so I just think that my biggest problem is the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and I think that it would be to your advantage and to ours that you not do that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=1990)|
| 0:33:20| And I appreciate all your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| And as a firefighter's widow, I am concerned about the fire departments getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2002)|
| 0:33:33| when they have an emergency, when you've got two lanes of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| where they can't move over or out of their way, how are they going to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| How are the policemen when they go on an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| And that is what I think about, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| And I just think that if you think real good about it, you won't okay this to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| And I thank you so much for your time, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| And, ma'am, we appreciate your husband's career as service to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| and we know it was a family service to the city, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Council, that's the end of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| So I think procedurally I have to move to approve so we can get it on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| at which time I'll make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| So I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| At this time, I'll make a motion that we reduce the proposed designation from RP2 to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| So we will hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Are you doing this on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| And since we're making this change, we'll need to do this on emergency as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| This can be all part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| So the amendment is to change it from RP2 to RP1 and to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| And, Mayor, I also wanted to, before we voted, review with Ms. Brooks, who's here, with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| the concerns that the neighborhood had expressed before, taking into account the e-mails that I'd received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| When MPC is doing their review, which is the next step in this process during the USON review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| I'd like you to consider the impact on traffic and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| consider the site distance as impacted by the hills with regard to traffic and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| consider a deceleration lane and turn lane to improve traffic and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| to consider if the development is suitable and compatible with the surrounding community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| to consider the impact on the school zone for the area, to consider the impact on water flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| to consider sidewalks along the property and a crosswalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| consider the impact of sound and light from the development on the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| and consider ways to preserve the pond that leaves it in its current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| And if a fence is necessary, it is an attractive and decorative fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and within the character of the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| So the second on that, did they accept the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Yeah, the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I accept the emergency also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| So is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| May I suggest the condition on grading be modified so we can regrade the slope to its natural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2193)|
| 0:36:43| So I guess what you're asking is that we have an additional amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| to allow the condition of the property to return to its natural state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| On the slope part of it, the part that's covered by the slope protection policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| there has been a road graded up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Our engineers discovered and evaluated the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and they just want to regrade it to get it back to the way it was naturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| and then they will leave the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| I can't hear you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| They just want to regrade the slope so the road is eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| and then the slope will be left as provided by the slope protection policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| With that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| You pull your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| If you want to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| What information do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Is this a proper amendment or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| I mean, I would support the amendment to return it to the natural state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| So I guess just point of order is, you know, what's the procedure we need to do to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| You've got an amendment on the floor that's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| I think you'd either need to vote on that and then also vote to amend again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| or you could withdraw that amendment in the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| and then make the whole thing as part of one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Why don't we withdraw the amendment and do one amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| so that makes it a little easier to follow for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| So a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| So wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| So the second, would you withdraw your second to the first amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| I will withdraw my second, but I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| is the grading of the slope something that we decide or is that an MP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| Is that in our court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Do I need to be called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| The woman rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| So in the MPC documentation, the one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| the rear westernmost portion of the site must remain undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| consistent with the hatched area depicted on the attached map labeled do not disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| This boundary is defined by 980 foot elevation of the topography map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| With the recommended condition, the site is appropriate to be developed under RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I think the condition is only describing this sloped area to the western back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| It's not the area with the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Am I understanding that correctly, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| You're talking about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| So there's nothing in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I guess the part that we're talking about, the pond area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| making conditions for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| and your request about grading or not grading there and being allowed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| is that something that will come up in the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Because it's not detailed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Is that something that was just offered by the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I don't see it here, and I think that's our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| John Shepard, 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee, on behalf of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So this is something that has come up as we got a little further along in our site planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and as we know, MPC added a condition to their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| that we include a non-disturbance area in that hillside in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| which we fully are supportive of and accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| There is already some land disturbance back there in the form of this two-track road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| that was actually referenced earlier in the commentary about it was used to install and maintain the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| In the slope area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| It's in the hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| In the slope area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| So what we would like to do is we would like to be able to regrade that slope area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| within the non-disturbance area and return it to its original grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| eliminate that existing two-track for a couple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| One, we think it will just aesthetically look better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| and it will reduce the size and amount of retaining walls that we had to put in on that side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| So that's the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| We feel like having that condition or amendment included within the council's approval of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| will make it clearer when we take our site plan to MPC that MPC has the authority to approve a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| with that grading in it without having to interpret the condition in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2467)|
| 0:41:17| Okay, we're letting our two lawyers talk about this to see what we have to do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| Did you want to say something, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Yes, Amy Brooks with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I will say that this is something that we can tackle as part of the development review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| as part of the USUN review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| I would say that we would consider taking the road back to its natural state as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2495)|
| 0:41:50| Is that sufficient? Do we need to make it as part of council's amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| I guess the lawyers are talking about this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| The only thing that worried us was this was a condition of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| so when you get a K on the zoning map, we just want to make sure that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| We would submit it as part of a USUN review that we would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| but we don't want to violate a condition that is on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| It is something that we can review as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| There might be some additional conditions that are put on depending on what that plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| So what would be the proper motion now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| If we're still talking about the grading, I think the question is, was this something that was considered by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Yes, it's a condition that they placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| It's a condition that was placed on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| I haven't heard everything because I've been speaking with Mayor O'Hara and Deputy Law Director Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| So the condition that MPC passed was an area remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| So as part of the proposal, did the developer say they wanted to do what they're wanting to do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2583)|
| 0:43:12| I am not aware of that discussion that happened during the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Okay, so returning it to the natural state, which would be disturbing it, was or was not discussed at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2596)|
| 0:43:27| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| That specific question was not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| The land disturbance area in general was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| but this temporary disturbance to restore the slope to its historic condition was not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| It was not discussed at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| But I would add this, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| When we filed the application, it was simply for RP2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and the condition was placed on it by MPC at the staff reporting area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2630)|
| 0:44:05| Let's see what Mr. Mills thinks, but if it was not considered at MPC, I have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| Wasn't it considered because there's a big section of it that's protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2651)|
| 0:44:22| That to me seems like it was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| If it's council's sense, perhaps, and MPC is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| that we could address this issue as part of the use on review, I think we would be fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| So it's in the record that council is asking that you address this in use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Is that what we would depend on, rather than making it part, or do you need it as part of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| I don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| MPC does not need it as part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Okay, so it's in the record that that's what you all have said that you will look at, that you will work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| that you will address that during the use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| I guess I would defer to your legal counsel on whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| when is the appropriate time to remove a condition that was put in place by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| I don't know what the appropriate procedure is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| We're not asking the condition be removed, simply that we be able to work on restoration of the slope where it has been degraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2724)|
| 0:45:34| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| So can you clarify for me, when this was discussed at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| did you guys know that this grade work needed to be done when the condition was placed in the course of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| or is this a new discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| We just simply weren't far enough along in developing a grading plan to know that this existed, the two-track existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| So you've met with engineers, developers, somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| So then my next question is, if and when a condition is attached in whatever form that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| whether that be at MPC during the concept plan or here, and we're trying to figure out how that's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| this may sound like an ignorant question, but for the general welfare of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| since we're going through the trouble of doing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| who is going to monitor that and ensure that it's put back to its natural state and the conditions of the condition are adhered to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2786)|
| 0:46:36| I believe that that would be MPC's authority to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| It would be engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| It would be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Okay, so you send out inspectors to make sure that it's stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| We send out stormwater inspectors for most construction projects and especially larger construction projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| so that would be on our list of things to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| I mean, it sounds like we need to include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I mean, honestly, I'm not a lawyer, but, I mean, there was a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| and we're definitely talking about allowing a disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| So if that wasn't clearly stated, I think we should include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| I mean, that's my opinion, and Rob seemed to echo that or started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Two separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| May I suggest it's not a disturbance but a restoration of the slope to its natural condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Which I think was the intent of the condition on the zoning from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2860)|
| 0:47:51| I mean, it's simply a restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| But that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| The area you're talking about with the restoration, is that where the road is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| It's where the two-track road that runs up to the billboard is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| So, and I'll have Mr. Frost correct me if I do this without the right language, but let me try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2901)|
| 0:48:30| Since we've withdrawn the previous motion, I'm going to make a motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| to reduce the proposed designation from RP2 to RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| and further amend to permit the property to be returned to its natural state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| with regard to slope at the point where the road is currently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| I think those are two separate amendments that should be considered separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Okay, so what I need is make sure that we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| to change the zoning from RP2 to RP1 on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| That would be the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| On emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| On emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Okay, so let's do that first, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| This is to rezone, to downzone it to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| That passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Now we have a question of what we need to do next, and they're continuing to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Well, you should let them hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I should let them talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Let them hear the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Councilwoman Ryder has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I don't know if it's a question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| It's a question for the folks from Elmington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Whatever this road is, the two-track road that goes to this billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| at the last meeting you guys told us the billboard is staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Is this road not needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Is this access not needed to service this billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| No, we want to eliminate it and provide access to the billboard along the northern edge of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| which doesn't require any grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I mean, frankly, they can maintain and service that billboard on foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| So the existing two-track isn't needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Where do they park their vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| In our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| So they would park in the development's parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| And then hike up the side of the hill with their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| It's not very far up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And you can access in a truck up the hillside as it is without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| Is that what this road has been for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I believe it was put in when they actually installed the billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| like the metal pole in the ground with the foundation and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| which required some additional infrastructure or equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3064)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| We're just trying to figure out a sound way to get everybody where they're wanting to go in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Mr. Mills and I discussed a couple of potential options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| The Connett undisturbed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| something that wasn't really considered at MPC I'm not wholly comfortable with, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| If there was a way that the developer would be willing to go to MPC for the limited purpose of asking MPC to change the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3102)|
| 0:51:54| to change that one condition after it's been duly considered by the professional planners at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| I don't know if there's a way that you all could proceed with your project and do that for that one limited purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3122)|
| 0:52:13| And then if MPC were to approve that, it would need to come back here for two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| Yes, which I would anticipate, you know, going from RP2 to RP1 is being done on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| It might be able to be done on an emergency basis at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| I don't know where you lie in your process and your progress of moving this on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| Or if you are approved if you are approved tonight with a condition in place, would that allow you to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| Then you could go to MPC to seek to have that condition modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| Yes, sir. That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| We filed for the use on review subject to your all's action tonight, which MPC would hear in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3177)|
| 0:53:07| And I assume they could hear the request to modify that condition in October and it could come back here in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3187)|
| 0:53:18| I think MPC could make our use on review subject to the modification by council of that one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3198)|
| 0:53:29| We are obviously months away from construction because the use on review has to go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3209)|
| 0:53:38| Then you go to the design phase, which is, what, four or five months at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| So is what Deputy Law Director Mills and I discussed workable for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| Okay. Thank you. Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I don't think I had anything further, Your Honor. I think I left my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Okay. All right. So then we're finished with that item, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| Did I do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| That was simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| For tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Oh, wait a minute. I actually do have to vote once more. So we amended it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| And now we're voting on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Okay. Everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3259)|

| 0:56:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| I just wanted to ask Becky Wade to come up and tell us what 3.4 million is what we're paying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| and how much this is the end of this 10-year agreement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| It's almost the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Yeah, this $3.4 million will finish the infrastructure work on Phase 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| primarily sidewalks, green space, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| All of that is the housing there in Phase 3 is under construction now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And it will also cover the cost of hazardous material abatement in what's going to be Phase 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| and then the demolition, and that's demolition of the final units of Walter P. Taylor Home that are now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| So those will come down to make room for the last phase of housing development of the last 80 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| This maxes out almost all the funds that the city has appropriated for the Five Points redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| It's over $13 million over the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Yeah, I think it's important to note that the money that we're spending for is infrastructure, sidewalks, roads, so forth, so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| We're not building the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Other people are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| KCDC and their contractors are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Yeah, so I just think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| It's a huge project for the city of Knoxville and certainly looks fantastic, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| I want to recognize the CEO of KCDC, Ben Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| 11C is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation, if necessary, of a fee-simple interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| in certain property located at 2122 Harvey Street, believed to be owned by Jerry and Mildred Berkley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| at an estimated cost of $7,900, as recommended by the Abandoned, Blighted, and Vacant Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Yeah, so again, Becky, I just want to iterate that this is a long, drawn-out process to get to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| where we're actually approving possible condemnation on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Vacant, blighted properties are presented to our department through a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| Usually they come to us through Neighborhood Codes Enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| by way of the Vacant and Abandoned and Blighted Properties Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| and if it's determined that we feel acquisition is the only way to turn it around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| to get it in the hands of a responsible owner and get it back into use as housing and on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| then we can start the process of getting it determined blighted, determined and certified blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| and that involves at least three hearings where the owners are notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| They are given the opportunity to bring the property back to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| and do work on it and improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| If that's not done, then it goes to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| And many times these properties have owners that are not around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| They're deceased and their heirs are not in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| so that's why they have sat vacant, they are taxed delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and they're a real nuisance for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| So it's our job to acquire these and get them out of that blight status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| and then back in productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So we pay them based on what's the value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| How is the value determined for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| We will have the property appraised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| and that appraised value is what is paid for the property in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| If it's a negotiated sale, it's paid to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| If the owners cannot be found, it is paid into the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And then we relist them in your Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| and try to recover that money and sell it to somebody that will use it and renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| Right. Our goal is to alleviate the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| Once we acquire it and the city owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| then we can list it through our Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| and whoever applies to purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| we make sure that they have proper financing to purchase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| as well as complete all the improvements that need to be made within a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| so that it is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| And if that's not done, we have the ability to take that property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Good. Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Ms. Wade, just really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| So for everyone to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| there are a lot of neighbors and neighborhoods out there with abandoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| and I think it's really clear for everyone to know that they're abandoned and unoccupied typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| And so we'll have constituents that will contact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and want to know why an abandoned vacant property can't be addressed in a fast manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| or acquired by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| What are our limitations to acquiring more and getting more vacant properties back on occupied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| A couple of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| First of all, it's very staff intensive to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| We have basically one staff person that works on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| There's money involved in the acquisition in paying those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| plus stabilizing the property once we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| We do make sure that it's boarded and that the yard is mowed and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| We typically take the ones that are the most bothersome to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| Oftentimes, owners will come through and actually either sell it or abate it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3777)|
| 1:03:06| Okay. So about how many do we have go through the Homemakers Program a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Typically around 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Okay. Citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Okay. And we have the opportunity to recoup the amount that we're spending for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| which is based on appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| There is the opportunity to recoup some of that cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| but not the boarding costs, the mowing costs and all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| and the lost tax revenue when it's resold through the Homemakers Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Right. I mean, it's not a money-making program by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| It's a blight remediation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| So what we spend is to get the properties brought back up to viable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3820)|
| 1:03:49| and back on the tax rolls and have families in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| So, you know, sometimes we spend more on the cost to acquire them and maintain them than we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| But it's an investment worth making in the communities because then somebody else comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Increases the value of the property, lives in it, becomes a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| We don't have the fire calls, the police calls, the codes calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| So we know going into this we have to pay a certain amount based by law, based on there's a long due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| If someone's, you know, even though they may have abandoned the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| they may be deceased or live in another state, there's still a due process that has to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| That's what takes so long on these often, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| And then once we are in a position to then acquire like you're doing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| then we may or may not get all of our money back from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| but you have to factor in the value of the benefit to the neighbors and to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| of having this property in new hands and being renovated and lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| So if you put a value to that, then we get our money back from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| It's hard to put a value on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=3914)|

| 1:07:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Yeah, so Mr. Hagerman, our report says that this is the second of three contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4027)|
| 1:07:16| so what was the value of the first contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| I'm sorry, I was thinking about your question and my name at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I'll run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| The previous one was $184,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| It was competed in such a way that it gave us the option to continue with the same consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| after the first phase into the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| So you picked the same company for all three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| Yeah, we competed the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And that first phase is what we saw back in June, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| We saw out there at a public display the models and that was phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And then this is phase two, takes that and puts it into document construction drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| Yeah, final design construction documents and bid documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| And are the designs still being determined, I guess, or still taking input on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| There will still be some interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| There's still going to be some public input opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| Okay, so there will still be public comment as that goes along and gets rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| And then we'll have this part in basically a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| And then the third phase would be to bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| And then this same company then would be oversight the construction and installation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| Correct. Assuming we're still happy with their work, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| Assuming that we're still happy with their work, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| So we'll get progress reports and we'll get other public opportunities to see these plans over the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180828?start=4139)|
