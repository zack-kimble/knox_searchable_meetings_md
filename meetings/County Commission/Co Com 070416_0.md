| 0:01:24| Before we do the devotional, this month it will be by Commissioner Larry Smith, but before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| we do it, I'd like to ask everyone to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Let's have a moment of silence for the shooting victims' families and everybody involved down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| at Virginia Tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| I'm going to preach a little bit, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| I'm going to have my fellow commissioners help me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| Commissioner Lambert, if you'll hold the good book here for me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| Commissioner Ballard or Huddleston, if you'll hold that basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| Today, we're going to be recognizing, I think, the Lady Vols a little bit later, and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| finished up with basketball season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| So what I thought I would do, Mr. Chairman, I did a little correlation between basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| and the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| And as you know, my hobby is basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| What I have here is a set of authentic rules from 1899 when the game of basketball was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| invented by Dr. Naismith up in Springfield, Massachusetts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| And they correlate quite a bit with what's in the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| In the Bible, you'll find that man has his rules, and then Mr. Naismith had his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| Both the Bible and the basketball, as you know, are made out of leather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| And the Bible has its rules in the Ten Commandments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| The basketball is for a season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| The Bible is for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| With the basketball, you play with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| And with the Bible, it has the answers of life in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| And the basketball that we have here, I have that signed by the grandson of Dr. Naismith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| the inventor of basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| That was signed by his grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| This was inspired by the man of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| So let us have a quick prayer, and then we'll have the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Our Father, we thank you for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| We thank you for East Tennessee, a place of its beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| We thank you for basketball here and what it means to this town, what it can mean in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| But we want you to take us today as government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| and give us the wisdom as to what we should do for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| because, Lord, this is a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| We're so thankful that we live here, so thankful that you brought us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| And let's be good stewards of our land and our resources that you've given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| and our county's money that we have to be empowered over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| and be with each commissioner and give us good judgment and good wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| and be with all of our elected officials throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| In your son's name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| If I want to please stand, the pledge to the flag will be led by Commissioner Josh Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you, Commissioner Jordan and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Okay, we're on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| We have a request to remove, well, not to remove, but to bring Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| It's on page 16, close to the front as we can for Mr. Brayden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| with the code enforcement of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| He needs to get out to the Habitat houses, so he's wanting us to move that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Also, we have Eddie Maness, and we're going to move you up just as quick as we can here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| So, Commissioner Leupold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I don't know if anybody wants to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| It's on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| There's two ordinances there where both committees recommend it be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| It would be Resolution 007-4103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| That has to do with the convenient recycling centers and persons there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| That was discussed in the committee, and also the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| 104 on the stormwater management ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| We know we had a hearing this last week and other ones there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and both committees have said those should be deferred to our next meeting, which is more than 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| but it's our next regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Unless somebody wants to discuss them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I would just move that we just go ahead and move that we defer them to our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| unless somebody wants to have them discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| If we have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| We didn't have an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Yeah, I'd like to move the food policy report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Dwayne Gregg is here, and I'd like to move it up as quick as we could to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| He's on open form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Where is it at on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| It's on open form at the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| I want to move him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| If we have no objections to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Commissioner Bolus, I think you want to remove from consent Resolution 102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| and have it right after 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Yes, sir, if we could please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| No, after Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=425)|
| 0:07:15| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I wish to make sure that 905 and 908 are not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| Are they off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| 905 and 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| No, 905 and 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| They're not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=456)|

| 0:07:49| Also, we need to add two resolutions, and they'll be 408 and 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| I think you have a copy of them dealing with permanent maintenance of stormwater on Lot 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| and on Lot 70 and 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| We need to add those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| Do we have any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| I just wanted to point out the ordinance on stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| I think Mr. VandeVeit has scheduled four additional hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Have you scheduled those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=511)|

| 0:11:40| Clerk, if you'll go ahead and read the resolution into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Whereas Ely Saluna has served as principal of Inskip Elementary since 2004 in exemplary manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| and whereas Ely Saluna has greatly improved the quality of student learning at Inskip Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| and whereas Ely Saluna has been an outstanding leader in the Inskip community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| with her knowledge of curriculum and her ability to teach and guide children in a positive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| The Commission of Knox County salutes Ely Saluna for her love and understanding of the children of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| and the tradition of excellence she has established with the teachers within Inskip School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=739)|

| 0:12:34| Okay. Commissioner Bolus, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you, Chairman Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=757)|

| 0:12:42| does a wonderful job as a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| She is a leader in the Inskip community, and since she became the principal there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| they have seen just a continuous improvement in their scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=769)|

| 0:13:00| I'm very proud to say that I serve as a fellow administrator with her in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=780)|

| 0:13:37| On behalf of the Dogwood Arts Festival, we are very happy to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=817)|

| 0:13:43| and we wanted to make a presentation on behalf of the Dogwood Arts Festival Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| and the festival itself to Knox County, Mayor Ragsdale, Chairman Moore, and all the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| and I am very fortunate to have the artist of the limited edition print for 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| The limited edition print is Spring in the City, and Mike Berry is the artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| and we would like to make this presentation to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=845)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you, county commission, for all you do for the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| We split that up a week, a week here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Yeah, you get it for a week, Mayor, and then I guess we'll hang it up for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| We might just put it in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| My house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Yeah, Lee's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| We'll have the report from Food Policy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| I want to thank Dwayne for the work he does for the Food Policy Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and I know he's given out some, I think everybody should have in their packet, the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| And at this time, I thank Greg, Dwayne, for doing what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Dwayne, you've got the floor, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| You give your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| My name is Dwayne Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| I serve as the chair of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| and I would like to thank the county commission for allowing us to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| and allowing us to make this presentation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| especially for Ivan Harmon for serving on the Food Policy Council for the past many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| As Ivan said, we put a lot of information in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| so I just want to hit a couple of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Also, I know a lot of you all are new members of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| We try to come in front of the county commission every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| and make a presentation regarding what the Food Policy Council has done during the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| as far as annual reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| The purpose of the Food Policy Council was established in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| The purpose is to continually monitor the food supply system in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| This is everything from grocery stores to obesity issues, nutrition, mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| cat buses to make sure that it's getting elderly people to the right places to get groceries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| farming, ag extension, just a little bit of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| The next thing I just wanted to quickly bring your attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| is one of the things that we started doing several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| You'll have a 10-carat award booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Every December we have this to recognize individuals and programs in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| that specifically have contributed to benefiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| and enhancing the food supply system in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| At the very back, you'll see a list of all those people that you'll recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| that have done things over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| In the middle of the booklet is this year's winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| It's also a time for us to have some guest speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| to educate those who came this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| There was about 100 folks that attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| And so we had Dr. Noe was one of the presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| talking about the food insecurity in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| We also had Dr. Betsy Houghton from UT to talk about food monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| And then we also had Laura Boren from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| regarding the new wellness policy in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| The next thing I just wanted to briefly cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| there were two reports this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| One is on food security, and the other is after Hurricane Katrina came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| that we did a report on how the readiness of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| regarding a major storm or disaster just related to food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| The first one on food insecurity, I'm going to skip the first two pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| and really just flip to the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| and I'll just highlight just a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| The first recommendation we came up with is to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| the homeless management information system that Dr. Noe has created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| to where all food pantries and coalitions are on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| as far as communicating and coordinating the needs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| The second is the need to have just someone who is in charge of all the pantries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| the coalitions, the churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| to where there's a coordination amongst all those countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| We found that the first question that we were asked when we gave this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| was, does Knox County have enough resources to provide for the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| to provide for those food insecure in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| And our specific answer was, yes, there is enough food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| but that doesn't mean people know where it's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| that it's so spread out within the county and the communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| and coordination amongst them isn't always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| The next thing I would highlight is that there's a downward spiral of food availability for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| during the summer because they're not in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| so that if we can increase the USDA summer feeding during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| those sites that the USDA reimburses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| that that would help a lot at the drop-off we have with those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| The next thing would be the efforts could be made that mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| thanks to county commission and city council, which has been fully funded now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| and there's not a waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| they feel like that there's a lot of other people who could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| and should be on mobile meals but either don't have the knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| or information that it's there or it's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| or they feel that there may be a stigma attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| So if it could be a public relations information to those folks, that that would and could apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| The last thing that I would like to mention on the food insecurity report is over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| up until about two or three years ago, CAC did a lot of funding for EFH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| and some of that staff support has dropped off over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And if that person could have a 20-hour week part-time funding to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and start coordinating a lot of these pantries and situations, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| The other report that we did on food resources in emergency situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| just highlights a couple of things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| One thing, and a couple of these we've already really taken on for this 2007 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| to really start working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The first one is identifying a contact person at the emergency operations center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| after we met with Alan Lawson who would be in charge of if there is a disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| that's a longer term disaster, who would be in charge of the food aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| They have people who are in charge of communications and coordination and housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| but actually not food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| The second thing is we could already create a list of in and around Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| where the food supplies, major food supplies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| whether it's manufacturers, distributors, grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| And that's one of the things we're going to start working on in the year 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| with the help of the Metropolitan Planning Commission and start mapping that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| The next thing that we also suggested is if there could already be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| a predetermined feeding sites in basically every neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| that before people get in a panic when there is a disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| they would know ahead of time if something happens in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| this is where I should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| The next thing that we talked about for the food resources is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and this is the last thing I'll mention on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| is the importance if you can get every household to know that the first two to three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| they should be prepared to take care of themselves, that they have food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| they have their own water supplies or medicines stored and stocked away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| until the government or other agencies can start to get them that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| Again, in 2007, our plan is to continue with the food insecurity report that we've started on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| the mapping that I discussed for the areas of food resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| and feeding possibilities in and around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| We may go to some surrounding counties like where Hackney is and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| to where there's large supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| As well, continuing to track the wellness and obesity issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| specifically with childhood obesity that a lot of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| has already been endorsing and doing those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| And at this point, we'd want to invite everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| We'll have the ten-carat awards again in December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| You'll get invitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| I hope some of you are able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I've read that report and I always think that government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| while they have a lot of responsibility, it's also a responsibility of individual families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| And your point about keeping a supply of food in individual families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I think, is one that ought to be emphasized because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| and it should be more than a couple of days because a lot of people really have a couple of days of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| But to have food supply in your home that you could weather something that would be for an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| even to a place where you'd be able to share that with your neighbors, you may not have been so fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| But people can build up those supplies over a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and they should have a supply of food as a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| And that program ought to be emphasized of individuals holding those food supplies to take care of themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| and really their family and their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| For that, all those points are very worthwhile that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1355)|

| 0:27:14| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Yeah, I just wanted to mention on 101, the resolution for Commissioner Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1635)|

| 0:27:33| that are working with victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| I'm sure a lot of folks know that last month, the Monday of the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| I went in and found that my car lot had been burglarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And I can't mention their names here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| but there's a lot of folks that work for the Knox County Sheriff's Department that don't wear a uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| and they work very, very hard to see that property is recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| And I'm thankful to say that at least the expensive stuff, my vehicles were recovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| and I'm not going to mention their names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| but I'd like to honor the officers that are working undercover helping the victims of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1684)|

| 0:31:00| This is a resolution to rescind the agreement that we made with the city some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1860)|

| 0:31:17| And this would seal the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Basically, we will receive the property back that was the subject of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1879)|

| 0:31:35| Which property is this, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1897)|

| 0:31:46| They did at their last meeting, and I believe that was Tuesday night, last Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| And we have, I believe, identified that through our resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1917)|

| 0:32:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Commissioner Leuthold and then Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| This is directed to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| I guess a concern that I have is that with this type of structure, other than debt retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| we would collect no property tax for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| And it looks like this developer here is going to go ahead and develop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| would sell the property, and I take it that point would be a pay off his loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| But for the next 15 years, all that money would be directed towards a payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| But would not that developer be responsible for that loan until the loan is paid off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| And it might pay off because he sold all the property right away or pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| It looks like they have all the money would take off to pay the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| The other thing is, is it possible to do less than the full non-debt retirement part to comply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2008)|
| 0:33:39| As far as the last part of that goes, I've got a call in to Mark Mamentov,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| who is I would call him a local expert on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| To answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| And I haven't had a chance to talk with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| I don't know if you all had a chance to talk with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| It was my initial impression that we could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| but it basically puts you back in a negotiation posture, I take it, with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I did have an opportunity to talk to Mark about that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| and he said as far as he knew it would have to be the full amount of the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| that there's no provision in state law for adjusting that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| And the second question was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| Well, that was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| But the first question, the last question, which you just answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| but the first question here is, for some projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| the person is going to be taking a period of time, 15, 20 years, to pay off a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| And this tax money goes in to retire that loan through time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Well, this kind of project, this developer, unless he's totally unsuccessful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| if they sell these condominiums, would have his money and presumably pay off that part of the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| How does that operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Because some of that money through time in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| as we collect the property tax through time from those new owners, would pay towards that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| So how is that debt held and how is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Is that person relieved of their responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| But how is that handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| The developer is not relieved of the responsibility for the entire TIF period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| He's on the hook for any shortfall that occurs through all the documents that are prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| And if something happened where a condo owner defaulted, then the bank would take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| and they would be responsible to pay those taxes on that particular condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| In your opinion, this project would not occur without this approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| That's my understanding from the developer, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Would you give your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Dan Tiller, 901 Broadway, Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| Dan, do you remember the specific conversation that you had with Mark about reducing the amount of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| That was last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I think I talked to him Friday about that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| He basically just says that there's no way to reduce it, that it's the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| That was his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Could the city reduce theirs and the county reduce theirs to a certain level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| If we reduce the amount, it would go back to the city to have another vote to reduce their amount as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| I guess that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I'm just not sure of the legal ramifications of that issue since it's not addressed at all in the TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Just a follow-up of the last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| This developer goes out, borrows money, builds his condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| I believe he's, what, building about 24, is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| There's 21 apartments in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| And he sells all 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Hopefully, he's successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| I don't know what time frame he thinks, but let's say it's within the next two, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| And he's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| I'm sure he's got a loan from a bank or some financial institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| He pays that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| He's got his profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I'm sure he's got a profit built in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| And that loan has been paid off, and those properties are free and clear of those incumbents, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| But the TIF loan is still outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| The TIF loan is still outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| And so the new owners of these properties would still have that against their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| Would that still encumber their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Their property would be encumbered by the taxes that they would owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| But the developer is on the hook for any shortfall that might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Once he's sold out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| He's still, that loan is still in place for the TIF period, which would be 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| and the developer is still on the hook for that loan until it's paid off, either by those condo owners or by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| Well, I'm sure he's got a profit built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| and I'm sure it's more than just a couple hundred thousand dollars for selling 21 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| Any idea what he expects those units to sell for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| He is present, if you'd like to speak with him, Jeffrey Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| My understanding is they'll be from 159 to 380.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2326)|
| 0:39:03| Jeffrey Nash, 3012 Whispering Cove Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| Mr. Nash, I assume that you expect to turn a profit off of selling these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| To be honest, we couldn't get any form of bank financing unless we proved that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| I don't understand why you need this amount of money from the county and, for that matter, from the city to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2360)|
| 0:39:31| I mean, why is it that you have to seek a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Because the project shows a shortfall in relationship to the sort of construction loan that we would be provided by a banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| Bankers always look for a particular percentage for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| which essentially is for margins of problems that occur during the course of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| And when you're redoing a building of this nature, which, as you're all aware, suffered fire damage in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| and which has since then been open to the elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| there are enormous problems that we could come across during the course of the reconstruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| The bank insists that there is X margin available within our pro forma before they will even consider granting us the money for reconstruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2410)|
| 0:40:20| And the TIF is what bridges that gap between the margin that the bank are looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| and what the actual development shows prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| Let's say you're successful in this project, and we all hope that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| And I believe you're borrowing somewhere a little over four million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| How much is the bank loan for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| The bank loan will be for something like just in excess of three million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Three million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| We, the developers, are putting in something in the order of a million dollars of our own money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And if you're successful in selling these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| why is it that the TIF could not be paid off during the same period that the bank loan is being paid off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| So that in case he sells these, let's say, over the next three years, how come the TIF can't be paid off during that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| Is there a law against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Can someone answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Well, I can answer that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| In reality, we as developers would end up, if we paid off this loan immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| we would actually end up with the same sort of margin as we would end up with if we put our money into a CD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| So to be honest with you, the risk that we take in redeveloping a building of this nature is such that we must see a certain margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2498)|
| 0:41:47| The period of the TIF, we are still on the hook for making sure that that money is all repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| If during the course of and if we don't sell all of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| any shortfall in property tax falls back on us, the developers, to make sure that we cover that shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2518)|
| 0:42:12| Bill, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Bill Lyons with City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I think probably the best way to look at the TIF loan, I know it is very confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| is that's part of the financing without which the project just doesn't work at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| And that what the developer is doing is getting traditional financing from the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| putting some of his own money in and also getting an additional loan that will be paid back by the taxes that are paid after it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| Our judgment is, and we have to review these before we recommend them to go forward, is that closes a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| That TIF loan closes a gap without which the development just could not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| That's why we've recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| That if we don't have that TIF, there's not enough money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| The bank will not lend them enough money and the number, the project is basically upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| It will not prove out to produce, even break even, let alone any kind of profit for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| So once they're sold, all the people pay the taxes who buy them, the condominium owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| and they go back into the fund to repay that loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| And the bank has to, of course, accept that they really will sell them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| and they'll sell them at the price that they estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| So we look at our TIF program as a gap closer to close a gap for development that we don't think could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| that we very much want to happen to put the building on the tax rolls long term and to, you know, get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| fix a very bad situation with a very deteriorated building that's unoccupied now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| I don't know if that's any clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Well, I guess what I'm asking is if a bank loan can be paid off as these units are sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2625)|
| 0:43:55| how come the corresponding TIF that goes to those units could not be paid off as those are sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Because if a bank loan is sold off, let's say in a three- or four-year period, okay, they've made their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| if they're all sold, they have their profit, okay, whatever profit margin they're expecting to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| And I don't know how much that is, but usually when you invest money, the higher the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| the higher return that you expect to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| So if he's got his profit, he's no longer over there constructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| He's no longer an owner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| He has nothing at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Why is the county still having to wait a 15-year period to have our part of it paid off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| The city and the county are both waiving the 15-year periods because there is no profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| There's not even a break-even unless that money, that loan is taken on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| and paid off by the taxes that come in is basically the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| That is, the project doesn't work without the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| There's no profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| There's not even a break-even because of the nature of the challenges of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| No bank would loan the difference and the project would not break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| You're saying the developer doesn't expect a profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| Without the TIF, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| The developer would not take on this project without the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| No, that's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| My question is, does the developer still expect eternal profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| You just told me no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| He does with the TIF part of the project, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| So the only profit he expects to make is the amount of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| No, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| He's making a reasonable return, giving risk and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| What I'm saying is you can envision that TIF as a amount of the financing of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| About 12% of the entire development cost is the TIF or 12 to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| That is, that's the amount of dollars the developer will get out to finance the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| And without that TIF, the loan that the TIF will pay off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| there would be not enough to construct the building such that the developer could even break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| And, Bill, if you'd like to do a workshop or something on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| We had one with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| It's pretty hard and it's pretty complicated just out of the blue to get this out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Well, another point is that the building could stay in the shape it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| disrepair for a period of seven, eight, ten years or never get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| And so we wouldn't receive any taxes other than what it's marked down to as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| That's exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| And what our concern is, is we, without this, there will be no increase in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| There will be further deterioration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| And we've all got a big problem demanding services on our hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| But we won't get, we won't even get at best the taxes we're getting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| It's the but-for argument that this project can't move forward without this TIF to make it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And it fixes an eye sore on gay street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Bill, what you're really saying is he couldn't sell these apartments high enough to pay that $4 million loan off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| really is what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Well, Mr. Pinkson, that is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| In order to try to get the numbers to work, the prices you'd have to demand would be so high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| nobody would ever buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| So the bank would say we're not making the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| That's basically what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Craig, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I was just trying to do some quick math in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| And the average sales price is going to be somewhere around $200,000, a little over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2832)|
| 0:47:21| That's pretty well what you'd get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| I mean, assuming the market holds up and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I'm just, he expects the average sales price to be somewhere around the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| I mean, because you gave a range of $159,000 to maybe $300,000 and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| So maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| So the average $225,000, somewhere in there, times the $21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| So that comes a little bit over $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| That's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Because if I have to reconcile this, and knowing the tight budget that we have coming up, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| and our budgets aren't getting any easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| They seem to be getting harder and harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| You know, I have to reconcile some way that we're giving up potential tax dollars for the next 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2881)|
| 0:48:10| I mean, because we're not going to see the big increase for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| These are sold, they're condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| I mean, in 15 years, we're going to see a huge bump, but not for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Let me have one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| That's true, but you're going to get an immediate bump during the period from the immediate bump during that period up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| from $1,800 to $4,700 a year that would not otherwise happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| So it's not, our looking at it is, and this applies to the city as well as the county both, you know, both in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| These dollars are, without this TIF, the city and the county are going to get the present taxes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| With it, the increase will be quite substantial just for the debt portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| And if the county debt happens to go up, it will be even larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| And then after the TIF period, they'd be extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| So there will be an increase in tax receipts during that period over what would otherwise happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| What happens during a reassessment year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| During reassess, this should be, well, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Would it just be revenue neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| It should be revenue neutral like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I want to ask John something just about, in general, TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| since I don't think a lot of the commissioners here went through a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| And then I'm going to direct it back to the, I guess, the people on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| But in reading the literature and asking a few questions since this has came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| generally at TIF you get your base revenue probably minus ten percent that goes towards debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Would that be a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| There is a provision in it that you don't have to pay because you do have debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| for whatever local government is being concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And then anything over goes to the developer or KCDC or the financial institute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Any particular piece of property within a TIF district receives a letter from KCDC in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| saying that out of this particular property they need to have so much money to be applied towards the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| And the reason that we do TIF is for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| Say with Paul district you have Lowe's, you have restaurants, and you have stuff like that, which he didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| Maybe down at North Shore you have a mixed bag of jobs, commercial, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| And that turns out real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| But if a piece of property is annexed by the city, then the city gets the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| and they return a certain percent, and it's a high percent, 85 percent, if it's an annexed piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| Would that be true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| If it gets annexed, the sales tax does get captured by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| 72 percent of which, whether it's in the county or in the city, does go towards education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| So really even when a piece of property is annexed for the county, if it goes to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| we're sort of in a position that we can swap dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I mean, it goes to education, but that frees up money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| But we still lose 28 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Well, not the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Yeah, 28 percent of the two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| And Commissioner Moore and I made a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| We were talking about this the other evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| And there may be an opportunity where maybe the city and the county can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| and come up with something where the ground rules are more equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| and it would not impede doing things like TIFs in the natural growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| Conversely, they might be able to also be able to cultivate a steady partner for downtown developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| because a lot of the things that have been going on downtown have been because of your leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| in issuing TIFs on behalf of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| But in a situation like this where we're only talking property tax, once we start to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| We don't lose anything on a property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| But, and listen to Craig say, if we have a building that goes online, a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| then we start gaining the sales tax immediately on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| So in a situation like this, without a sales tax kicker incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| then we're really only looking at to help the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And I guess, you know, a win-win situation for the developer and the county is get a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| and get the property tax on it so we can deliver services to everybody or in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I think it's a very fair assessment, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| In any case, the only thing that we're not gaining any property tax because the base we will get minus a provision for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3151)|
| 0:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| So, and I guess it's not exactly heart strings that are pulled, but if you have a blinded piece of property then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| then, you know, you want to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| But, you know, I don't see where that the county is sort of negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| or being brought in or the workshops or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| because I went up there and I pulled the public records on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| As I see that he has bought this piece of property from nine condo owners for $303,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| I also looked at the piece of property next to it, which is half the size, and it is a lot more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| And when he does the improvements, this is going to be a lot more valuable to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Now, is it possible for him to rent these for more than what's being presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Because in 202, there are several that was in that building that was sold for $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| So if these are nicer and improved, I would think that he already knows the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| and you all know the numbers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| And I'm not really sure that a TIF is needed because this also has historical property type things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| and he's going to get an incentive from somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| There's no incentive on a historical piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| You have to go through a whole other procedure to get historic tax credits that he's not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| They'd have to be rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Since these are ownership, there won't be any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| But I want to add that if these sell for more, then county tax revenues will be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| because the taxes will be higher than we're estimating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| But we think we have a reason, given the size of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| which are significantly smaller than the ones that were in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| But if I was to make a recommendation that this be done in four years in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| I don't know if the amount would be decreased, but that the tax, the TIF, ended in ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| what harm that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| And the other thing that really troubles me about this is the note already has been extended once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| and he's looking at April 30th date to either have the financing in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| or to extend that or the note will be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And to me, he already has no capital in it, and he's looking for a lot of breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Oh, he's got significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| They're going to put, what, a million as part of their development costs in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| And if for some reason it doesn't happen, then this is all null, and it's like we were never here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Everybody wants to clean up a piece of property, but what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Is the city and the county willing to do it at what cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| And I think you hear concerns from a lot of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| And are you saying that the project would fail if we say we'd like to see it completed in four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| and the TIF ended in ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| The numbers we went over were that 15 years of the tax paying off that note were necessary to close the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| before a bank would finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| No middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Well, I mean, I would say we could start over with a whole new project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| but I could let the developers answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We'd have to go back through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| but our reading of it is this is what the minimum that was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| and no more than to make this project bankable so that a bank would make the larger loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| and to make it basically doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| And our risk in that not happening is that the buildings sit there generating no taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| and being a blight for a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| And we have to go through that calculus as much as your thinking was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And that was pretty much the number, the 15 years is where we came down as what was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| Well, I think the obligation of the people here is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| we would like to get rid of a blighted piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| and we certainly want a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| But he's the only one who knows how much he's going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and that's, I think, what Craig was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| And I think every development won't take a fallback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| in case you run into hidden cough rocks or whatever that it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| And I don't know that we should supply the safety net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| and ensure that he makes the top dollar versus the fair dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And I think that's what a lot of people up here are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Well, I can only respond to that as we think that there's the element of risk in that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| I mean, nobody knows if people knew that they could sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| that they could develop, build, and sell, that the market would support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| there would be a lot more development than there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I mean, the developer is at risk for this with all the units out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| and that has to enter in the calculation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| But I understand what the concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| They're very much the same concerns we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| I mean, they're no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| And as far as it deteriorating anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| I would suspect that Codes would condemn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| And he'd either have a choice to turn it down or we'd send him the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| Well, that would be a route that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| But then we have a property that's deteriorated, producing no taxes when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| I wanted to address one question you asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| and that is that the TIF could be paid off sooner because the bank is not going to loan the full amount of the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| increment that would be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| So there will be an excess increment which will be deposited into one of the accounts that we set up with the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| which means that it could be paid off in 12 years, 11 years, or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| So when you're talking about sooner, that's still the city and county paying that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And if the newspaper where we get a lot of information is correct, that's over $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| That's what was reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| $600,000 for we're not paying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| I think what Dan is saying is if these sell for higher and they generate more taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| the TIF will be paid off in 10 years or nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Watch them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Watch them out, the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| That's going into the TIF payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| $437,000 is what that part is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Again, if the taxes generate that earlier and if we're right and say everything goes great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| then it will be not a 15 year but a 12 or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| It only extends as long as that dollar amount until it's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| But our cost is whatever it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| But it's for, yes, for fewer years, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| So I guess it's less if it's paid off sooner, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Maybe I'm just, maybe I just understand TIFs better or maybe I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| But, guys, this is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| We don't have to invest any money in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| We don't have to take any money out of our pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| And we're going to make close to three times what we're making now on the property taxes during the TIF period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| And when the TIF period ends, we're looking at a windfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Now, if I could do this with my personal finances, not put any money up, let the developers take all the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| let the banks take all the risk, and immediately more than double my profits, it would be a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| And I think it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| If I understand this correctly, it looks like a no-brainer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| We don't have to put anything into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| And immediately when the TIF goes into effect, we're getting more than twice what we're getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| And then at the end of 15 years, we're getting substantially more than what we're getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| And especially when we look at, I've been through some cities that have not done redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| Now, I don't agree with everything they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I don't agree with some of the use of eminent domain that some municipalities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| But I tell you what, I've driven through some cities that look like a bomb had gone off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| because they didn't do this kind of thing to save their downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| So when you look at that, it doesn't cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| We're going to more than double our property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| As another benefit, we're going to have a beautiful city to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| I think it's a no-brainer, unless there's something I'm not getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| I intend to vote for this, and I'd like to encourage everyone else to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| I think it's going to be good for Knoxville and it's going to be good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| I've dealt with probably 15 or 20 of these over the course of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| They are designed, as Mr. Tiller said, actually as an integral part of the financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| There is no financing package without this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| We're not paying anything to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Our only, and Commissioner Lambert tried, our only deal is to get more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| which, if anything, will help, albeit a little bit, with our budget situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| In addition to that, I would be willing to bet both of these buildings, this one and the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| will sit there another ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| We've got a developer that's willing to shell out a million dollars of his own money to put it in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| and to roll the dice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Now, if he is more successful, Commissioner Lutho, the TIF will be paid off sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| If he's less successful, it will be paid off in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| But rest assured, it will be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| We've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| And I would encourage everybody to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Mr. Chairman, I'm a bit scared because I find myself agreeing with Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| And so I just wanted to say that I do agree with what Commissioner Lambert had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| that, you know, when you have a developer who is willing to come in and take a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| which has been burned out, sitting there giving us $710 a year now, putting up a million dollars of their own money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| he's taking quite a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| He doesn't know that he can sell all these condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| We hope he does, but he doesn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| But he's willing to roll the dice and he is willing to come in and take a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And I'm willing to help him with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| And so I'm willing to vote in favor of these because it seems to me that if we can get some good quality condominiums there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| and if we do sell out, you're bringing people to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| These people probably are either going to move furniture from an existing location, maybe buy furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| That helps us because we're able to generate some revenue off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| You know, these folks are going to be eating downtown, probably going to Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| probably going to the new Regal Cinema or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| But you're going to have people coming downtown and they're going to be spending money in the downtown district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| I see this as a win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| And if the gentleman happens to make some money off of this, then more power to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Because the county is going to make money off of this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Because when the TIF period is over, as I see these figures, we're looking at $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| Right now we're getting $710.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So, again, Commissioner Lambert, maybe we could, you know, get together afterwards here and shake hands or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| But, nonetheless, I do agree with Commissioner Lambert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| That might violate the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Well, as everybody knows, I was one of the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| This has probably already been over, but I was the one who made the motion to defer this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| And I've done it for one reason, and that's to get Albert Nance's attention, which I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| I talked to him and John Warner both there about how a lot of these things have been unfair for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| when we go out and put our money in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| And then the city comes out and annexes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| We lose our sales tax, the $0.28 that the county gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| We don't lose the $0.72 that the schools get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| And I got Alvin's attention, and he assured me, and I don't know whether Dan knows this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| but he's talked to Dan, that he would look in to trying to make these things a little bit more fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| where there would be some way we could share our sales tax and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| And I talked to Commissioner Warner about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| But this is one thing I am concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| I'd like to ask Dan this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Dan, you said the gentleman is guaranteeing this loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| He'll be on the hook, say, the $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| If it lacks a million of being paid off, he has to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| I would like to know, is this the corporation signing and him personally, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| It would be the he would be the I guess the general partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| It's personal guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I don't want just a corporation because I know what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| They can bankrupt it, and then they're off the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| They are personally guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| That's what I want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| I'm going to vote for this like I told Alvin here a week before I went on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| I just done it for that, but I told him I'd support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| But the ones where sales tax are involved, I can't support them unless there's something worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| to support Knox County because any time we lose revenue in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| I represent city and county people both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| I have to raise taxes, and the people in the city have to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| So we need to work something out on the sales tax part, and that's the only thing I'm interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| Chairman, I was going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Dan, in the event of this guy, if he passed away, does it pass on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| Can it be passed on so the TIF is guaranteed at the end of the 15-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Do you have an answer for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Does he need an insurance policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| There's three people that have personal guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| There's three partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| But, you know, if all three passed away, I don't know I would defer to Mr. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| Insurance will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| But it is not just a limited liability corporation, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| They're guaranteeing it personally also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| That's what I want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=3978)|

| 1:08:17| And one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I know we already voted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| but I wanted to let this body know that in the agreement that the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| this body and the school board made to stop the fighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| that we would not get in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| And to me it seems like that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| That's the reason we have the educational consent agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| We used to vote on everything that they would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| So it's part of the agreement that we made with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| So now we're getting into their personal business, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Nothing but the funding mechanism for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| And we get into it by restricting the range of choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Clerk, 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| That's the reason I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| This is a resolution appropriating $62,000 for the lease of the Knox County Clerk's Office at Hall Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| First off, I wanted to disclose that I do work for the Knox County trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| and we do have satellite offices in the same location as the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Finance committee 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Made by Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Second by Commissioner Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Commissioner Kaye would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| I'd like to just make it known that I work for Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| and my husband also works for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Make it known that my son works in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| I know someone that works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| And if you read the news, you know I have some family members that work throughout Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| And I have the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| And my mother works in Knox County Trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| I have a wife that works for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| And I'm not telling anybody about where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| I think we took care of all that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Commissioner Hammond, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I'm just making sure that I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| The money is going for facility or lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Lease payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| I messed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| There is some work that's being done throughout all the other elected officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| But in this particular case, it is for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| They had anticipated in their budget so many dollars for rent in all of their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| They did not budget enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| And during the middle of the other year, they had a new owner of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| And he also increased their lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| So that also bumped it up a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| So the $62,000 in this particular case is solely for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4266)|

| 1:11:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| And the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4271)|

| 1:11:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Motion made by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Seconded by Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| This was brought to you by the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| It was unanimous in asking you to go on record as urging the legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| and the legislature as a whole to vote against this cable TV bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4321)|
| 1:12:08| Basically what this bill would do is it would give the state the franchising authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| and it would take it away from the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I passed around to you a list of the fees which we have received in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| in fiscal year four and five, and it amounts to $3.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| Mr. Werner was also kind enough to tell me that last week Comcast gave Knox County a check for $1.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4345)|
| 1:12:36| which was good for fiscal year 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| So you add 1.9 to that 3.9, and that's what, about 5.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| So that gives you an example of the type of fees that we're getting from the cable TV industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Taking this away and taking it to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| even though I understand that there is a provision in the bill which would keep the money local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| can you say 9-1-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Do you remember when we were supposed to get funds from 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| and they decided they weren't going to give it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| All they have to do is come back and say, hey, let's change the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| And if you're looking at $5.8 million from Knox County, do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Ninety-five counties and municipalities across the state, you're talking about a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| If the state can get its hands on that, I think they will, or at least a large portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| We will have to make up that revenue somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Secondly, taking it away from, taking the authority away from local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| means that if someone has a complaint about their cable TV service right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| they can bring it to the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| I don't think they want to go to Nashville if they have any types of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And thirdly, because this is in limbo in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| it's hampering our ability to negotiate a contract with the cable companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| as Mr. Owings told our finance committee last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| So those are just a few of the reasons that we would encourage you to vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| and let's send a message to Nashville that we are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| I would also add that the Mayor's Association across the state is against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| The County Commission Association across the state is against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Several municipalities have already passed similar resolutions, and I would ask that we follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| From watching what's happened over years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| it seems to me when money goes from Knox County into the central time zone, we never get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| Say BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Plus the local control issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I think this is an important piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| It's an old riddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| It's not five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| It's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| And calling a bill competitive doesn't make it competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| AT&T is out there saying that this is going to need competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| Maybe, but we doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Let's look at the brief history of this sucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| We have cable franchises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| It is an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| It is a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| It is saying it's an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| It says you are allowed to use our rights of way to wire our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| In exchange, we expect the following things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| It's government at its best and it's government at the local level where we are directly in touch with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| The ink was barely dry on these agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| When certain companies went to Congress and said, well, deregulate the rates in those agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| because competition is coming along and you won't need them and the rates will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| And after that, the rates went up at two to three times the rate of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Then in 96, we had a telecom act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| And, again, big companies went to Congress and said, deregulate the ownership's provisions in those acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| because you don't need it, fantastic new stuff is coming along and prices go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| and rates went up at two to three times the rate of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| And now it goes down to the local, state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| And some companies go to Nashville and say, get rid of the provisions for the franchising agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| and the franchise fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Send them out to Nashville and maybe they'll come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| and maybe there'll be more if more people buy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Do we even have an expression for fool me thrice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| This is not a competitive bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| What this is is AT&T and its lobbyists getting their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Murfreesboro, Cleveland, Shelbyville, Irwin, Franklin, the Tennessee Municipal League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| the Tennessee County Services Association all oppose this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| It doesn't have build-out provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| The big company, AT&T, can cherry-pick neighborhoods and leave others underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| We've already talked about the franchise fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Also, it would nearly, almost unguaranteed, destroy public access by putting it on a higher tier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4594)|
| 1:16:41| and eliminating most of the systems by which it is financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| So for several good reasons, some of which Commissioner Hammond has already outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| these bills are a bad deal and they need to be defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I just wanted to say there must be a full moon out there or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| because I actually agree with Mr. Hammond and Mr. Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| I encourage everyone to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Spirit of cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I can agree with you on this, but there's one thing I would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and especially to you, Mr. Hammond, since you're the chairman of the Cable Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| We need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Mr. Harmon made a point there about how AT&T and even would cherry-pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| We've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| I think cable TV has been here since the 70s, mid-70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| They're still cherry-picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| We have a lot of people that can't get cable TV, and they've been here for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| So we need to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| And I don't know how we can control their rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| but I get more complaints on dirty lots and cable TV than I believe I do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| People complaining about how it keeps going up and people wanting it and can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| So the next time we come up with this franchise thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| we need to make them do something to get these people out here not cherry-pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| is what I'm trying to say, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| And you know good and well that they do cherry-pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| An analogy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| They sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| And most of them in the city because the houses are closer together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and it's easier for us to service them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| But I just think we need to be a little strict on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| and I'm looking for you to give us that leadership, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Well, thank you, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| And this is one of the things that we were talking about in our committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| One of the things we're working with the law director on is as we do these new agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| that's one of the things we're really focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I don't see any more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| So if we're ready to vote, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4720)|

| 1:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Is Shannon Sitto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4783)|

| 1:20:10| No, she can't cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Ms. Cook, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| Honored commissioners, your honor, fellow citizens, employees of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4828)|
| 1:20:35| I'm here this afternoon to talk to you about two subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| The first relates to a decision made by the Knox County Retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| and Pension Board regarding Social Security withholding on the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| mandatory retirement plan employee contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| The second is how employees are informed of decisions made by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| that affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| I really don't relish being here, bringing this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| After speaking with my supervisor and employee representative, Mr. John Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4867)|
| 1:21:15| my commissioner, Ivan Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| and addressing the Retirement and Pension Board this morning without a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| I bring the matter to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| hoping that you will direct the appropriate process to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| An opinion has been rendered by Bill Mason, an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| I believe he's an attorney working for the Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| The tax laws dictate that Knox County should be reporting as income the 6%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| mandatory withholding to Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Knox County and the employees should be paying at least FICA tax on that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| and that 6% should be reported as earnings in the employee's Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| retirement account, which is used in the formula for calculating retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| disability, and survivor's benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| I'm not sure when the opinion was rendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| but I believe it was late last year or early this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| I was told the board voted in March that withholding of FICA should begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| in January 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| Only a handful of people know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| and I'm not sure if anyone knows how long Knox County has been out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| compliance with tax law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| I have no idea whether anyone has even been given the task to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| I would like to believe, I wouldn't have to point out the implications of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| hundreds of employees' Social Security retirement accounts understated for how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| But then if a decision could be made to postpone until next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| correcting an out-of-compliance condition of this magnitude without any plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| investigate potential liability for previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| with no communication to the employees, I'm guessing some folks don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| So I'm here to let you know I choose not to wait until next year to do what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| I respectfully request you instruct Knox County to immediately begin withholding on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| and reporting of the 6% mandatory retirement amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| and to make up whatever FICA has been missed this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| Further, I ask you to request an examination of previous years' tax laws to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| what further action is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| A complete audit from a tax law perspective would go a long way to increasing the confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| of employees that their income is being properly reported and taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| I also request you to direct the Retirement Department of Knox County to immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| and regularly update the employees on all decisions made by the Board that impact all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| including this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Okay, that's all we have on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| We'll be in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Mr. Chairman, I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| I guess I'm in the dark on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| What she says to me sounds very serious and something that we do not need to take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| But, again, I'm in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| And I guess I'm just asking for clarification on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| Commissioner, we had a meeting this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| I directed Bill Mason to get with Ms. Cook and find out and make sure we are in compliance with the tax laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| And he will do that this month and report back to the pension board next in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| So we'll have an answer to you the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Can I ask a question of you, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| Ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Is this what the retirement board does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| or is this through the county finance thing of what's being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| This is what, you know, Bill Mason and Mr. Beeler is going to find out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| We may have to get with John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I mean, it was hinted to us earlier, so I think we just need to get the attorneys together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| and make sure we are in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| Mr. Warner, do you want to comment on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Laura Coe is in the building in another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| She's trying to get down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| If it would be okay, after the recess, maybe let her talk before zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| It doesn't look like we have a lot there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| We have no objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Did you call her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Well, she called and canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Ms. Fields was at the stormwater hearing the other night, and I think, I won't swear to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| but I think she got her problem solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| I don't know if she got her problem solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I think I seen her on the front page of a local newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| Well, it was alleged it would be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| So we're in recess until four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| Roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5203)|

| 1:27:52| I came here today to talk to you about stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| but I'm not going to talk about the technicalities of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| I want you to see what stormwater runoff looks like from my back porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| and I want you to see what keeps me up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| I've brought some pictures that are being passed around by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| I want you to know that the stormwater ordinance you'll soon be signing will be worthless unless it's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5291)|
| 1:28:21| About four and a half years ago, I bought a farm in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| I could have settled anywhere, but I picked East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| I don't know where else I would have found such beautiful land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| As somebody in the environmental realm, I was familiar with the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| and I set out to do everything I could to protect the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| I installed best practices working with the soil conservation folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| I made sure that the horses are fenced out of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| I put in erosion controls and stream crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| A couple of years ago, my neighbor decided that he wanted to construct a high-density development next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| I was pretty concerned about the impacts of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| My area has a lot of very steep bridges, a lot of sinkholes, a lot of hidden streams, and a lot of limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5347)|
| 1:29:17| I think the plan was to put about 168 houses on 68 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| I went to MPC, I went to Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to express my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| I even spoke with a design engineer, and everybody assured me I would have no problems with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| Unfortunately, the development has gone like many others in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| The ridge was stripped, the land was raised, and the growth policy recommendations were ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| In April of 2006, construction began, and the muddy water invaded my pastures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| I've documented and filmed the pollution on my farm for the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| and those pictures are going to show you what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| I send most of my photographs to Knox County Engineering and to the state regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| The pictures that you see will show you what I see every time it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| And keep in mind, this is one of the driest winters on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| My farm will be destroyed within a year, and I have few options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| I can sell or I can sue, and neither of those choices are constructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| We all say we believe in a balance between development and preservation, and this isn't balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| This is destruction of one person's property for another's profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| There's probably more sites like this, and they may be much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| What is certain is that the rain will continue unless we find within ourselves the political will to enforce the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| that are in place to protect the community members from this kind of destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| I appreciate your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Thank you, Ms. Coe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Mr. Chair, I have looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| The property that's being developed is behind Sunnyview School, and she lives on, I believe, Bob Smith Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| which I had a good friend that lived on that piece of property for years back in the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| I'm very familiar with her piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| And what she says is true, and as you see those pictures being passed around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| if your property was being, really, I guess the good word is destroyed or bad word, like her property appears to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| they have made her a lot of promises that her property would not be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5502)|
| 1:31:51| If you can look at those pictures and justify that she's not been affected, then, you know, I would say say nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5511)|
| 1:32:01| But if we're going to have these stormwater regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| if this is not a good starting point as to what that can happen to a person's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| then I don't know what a good starting point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| And, really, you'd almost think of strip mining where they take hydraulics, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5535)|
| 1:32:23| is the best comparison that I can think of just off the top of my head in this situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| Now, as she states, she's been to several people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| She's trying to work with Knox County and be a representative on the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| And she's basically at her wits' end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| And I'm sort of at her wits' end, because this is something that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| If she goes to codes, and I see Bud's here, I don't know if MPC is involved in anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| I'll issue the permit so you wouldn't be involved in this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| We would be involved in it in terms of the overall review of any plans that come before us that require our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| In terms of permitting, that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| They do have storm drains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| They do have storm drains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| If their concept plan and stuff fails, then that doesn't fall back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| That goes to our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| In other words, they've gone out there and they've dug and they've put drains and they've put dams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Now, this water is just basically a mudslide when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| It's going into the creek, which goes into the Houston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| And you can offer no help as to the people putting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5618)|
| 1:33:46| Obviously, it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Now, if they go through the motions and they hope for the best, but if it's not working, that doesn't come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| That goes to engineering in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Are there any other places that we can point her besides that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| Or is that where it starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| She did point her to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I mean, if there's him and Bruce Weitrich, I mean, if there's additional drainage coming off of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| then somebody is in violation of codes already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| And, you know, she is on the stormwater committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| And if we don't help her and she's trying to help us and she's being ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| then I think we definitely need to send a message to either codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| And I would say as far as my dealing with codes, they've always went out and they've always done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| So I've not had any disappointment with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| But when I look at those pictures right there, there's a lot of disappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| And I don't know if I need to make in a way of a motion that would refer it to the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| or that engineering has been out there and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| then we need to do something for this lady today that has some teeth in it that this problem is addressed within a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5694)|
| 1:35:03| And I don't know how to go about it, but I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I'll ask other people maybe for suggestions on how we can handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| Let's start with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I guess I'd like to ask Chris Grangio if he could come and speak to the issue or if he's familiar with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5716)|
| 1:35:27| And certainly Ms. Cole's problem, it's a dramatic one, and it needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5727)|
| 1:35:36| And it's an indicator of where we are in Knox County in terms of our stormwater issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| and in terms of land use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| I think it indicates how we value the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| And I'm very, very sorry that you are having to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| And certainly engineering, I think, is concerned, very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| And I'd just like for Mr. Grangio to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| I'm Chris Grangio, Stormwater Management Coordinator for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| I'm very familiar with Ms. Cole's property and the issues in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| I've probably seen most of these photos over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| Interestingly enough, I suppose, a lot of work has been done to mitigate the impacts from construction on this site specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5787)|
| 1:36:36| My inspectors have been on site on several occasions with doing a paired site visit inspection with TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5796)|
| 1:36:45| which is the State Environmental Regulatory Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| so we can partner up on finding solutions and take enforcement action if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| And, in fact, I believe that actually a representative from EPA in the Atlanta Region 4 office visited the site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| And I say that interestingly enough because in many cases repair work has been done, additional controls have been put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5822)|
| 1:37:12| and the last conversation that I had with TDEC staff indicated that they felt like appropriate measures had been taken on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5832)|
| 1:37:22| I think there are also some issues revolving around the overall site plan itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| that may not be an indication of a problem with codes per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| but may be an opportunity for us to work with the individuals involved and try to come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| Chris, as you look at what's taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| if you could back up a little bit and say what didn't take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| or give us some should'ves, could'ves, would'ves on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5870)|
| 1:37:58| I mean, can you do that and explain why damage like this is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| Well, there's probably, it's hard to do that without possibly being unfair to certain parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| One thing that did come into play with the development is apparently the grading contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| the person responsible for doing the construction work and installing the controls on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| left or quit or in some form or fashion was removed from the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| And the developer was essentially left in a situation with nobody on tap to put controls in place, make repairs, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5909)|
| 1:38:39| And we had to come in and get controls in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| And a lot of this started out, I guess, early on in the process, somewhat behind the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| and just behind, I guess, you know, rears with getting controls in place because of that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5930)|
| 1:38:58| If this was your property and you were Ms. Cole, what would you do right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| I'd probably be doing the very same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| I know I would also be certainly in agreement with her sentiment regarding the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5946)|
| 1:39:14| and the enforcement action in the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| I think that our stormwater ordinance that we have proposed is very strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| has a lot of proactive measures with regard to site planning that could avoid some of these problems that you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| This is something that's essentially done under what's the same regulation that's on the books for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| As a county, are we doing what we should be doing for Ms. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| I believe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| In fact, I've spoken with some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| and I think we're trying to arrange yet a further meeting to look at the overall site plan for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| to see if there's any changes that can be made, additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| It's an unusual situation because, to my understanding, there's not a flaw or an error in the site plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=5996)|
| 1:40:03| This isn't a case of something that is a violation of code in the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| Who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Is there an ultimate responsibility in terms of the owner of that property and the owner of that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| My understanding of state law would be that at any time the owner is responsible for impacts that are derived from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| So the owner of this property adjacent to Ms. Cole would be responsible for damages or impacts caused by the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6026)|
| 1:40:35| or whatever is done on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| Chris, has he had an NOV, notice of violation, issued to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| I believe that there have been notices of violation issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| Another case, and I said this was an interesting case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| is that the developer has been extremely proactive in communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| and even arranged a meeting with our staff and Ms. Cole to try to see what kind of measures beyond the basic design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6059)|
| 1:41:08| environmental plan, could be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| And our experience has been that they have been cooperative to the point of being exemplary in their response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| Has he been fined for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| I do not believe that there's been a fine, but I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| I'd have to check the files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| I think you mentioned that he had the people that are supposed to implement the silk stringing stuff had quit him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6087)|
| 1:41:35| What procedure do we have if a developer starts a project and just goes bankrupt and leaves it vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| Who takes care of it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Well, there's probably a lot of different courses of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| Probably the most rapid would be to call on the bond that's put in place for erosion sediment control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| Again, that's one of the measures in the upcoming stormwater ordinance we hope to get passed is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| a formalization of that environmental so that issues such as this involving environmental protection associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| with a land development project can be addressed in a quick, rapid way that's rather easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| So do you have a meeting with this gentleman, this developer to, I think you said it's not much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| he's working on a project or something to get them together or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| I've spoken with several folks involved and interested in the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| and the discussion has been revolving around a meeting with actually with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| with representatives from TDEC about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| Actually, I think Ms. Cole may not be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| She may be looking at me funny over my shoulder when I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| Chris, did it not have to be either a faulty plan or a faulty implementation of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| That would be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| I mean, the drainage plan that was proposed, either that was inadequate or the way they put it in was inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| Isn't that what it had to be, or am I oversimplifying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| Well, there's actually a fourth or a third situation that would apply in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| I know we're, that's absolutely right, we're rather dry in terms of annual rainfall right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| But the typical environmental protection design, the erosion control design for development like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6205)|
| 1:43:32| is geared towards a two- or a five-year, rather small storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| And when we have a storm like we had in September of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| you have an amount of rain and an intensity of rain that's well beyond any kind of reasonable design for environmental protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| So you could get situations with pictures a lot worse than this with a design that was perfectly implemented, perfectly designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6228)|
| 1:43:57| It simply was overwhelmed by what nature brought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| Do we still hold a bond on this developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Yes, I believe we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| I don't know the bond amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| There's no chance of that being released until this is rectified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Has he sold a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Is this a housing development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| It's a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| I'm not aware, I don't know the state of lot sales and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| Is there, are there any homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| There's no homes yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| I think there's some construction started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| I don't know if it's a developer or other individuals building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| Back to Commissioner Ballard's question, I'm happy to do whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Well, he says there have been good communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| The first thing I'd ask along those lines is you seem to talk to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| and you seem to have a pretty good handle with the developers, but you want to be fair to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| But there's no fairness in this, Ms. Coe, at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| You can sit there and we can hammer this out, the pictures, speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| And I don't know how you're going on to communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I sent a little note to the engineering department to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| and get back with me some two to three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Have I got good communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Now, if what we need to do, he's out there bulldozing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| and if we have this with what he's already done, I want the dozer stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6318)|
| 1:45:26| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Now, can you make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| Can you stop any new grading out there until we get this problem solved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| I think that will give him incentive to look at this and communicate even better with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6337)|
| 1:45:47| Or even better yet, Chris, does he have an incentive to put in place these things for stormwater right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6347)|
| 1:45:57| rather than doing the groundwork for his construction sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| He evidently doesn't have adequate storm pre-planning done for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| or he's not accomplishing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Well, I'm not sure if that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I think that a lot of what's remaining to be done right now is actually work that would direct some of the stormwater runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6376)|
| 1:46:26| into the control structures more appropriately and adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| So in response to the question about continuing to work or not continuing to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| this may be a case where a call in to stop work could actually be counterproductive for what folks would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Chris, these are fairly recent pictures here after action supposedly was taken on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| But my concern, again, about the communication, when you have a commissioner ask you to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| there ought to be some sort of standard that you get back with him so that we don't have to bring this in front of the full board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| and maybe work behind or sort of call it to people's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| But independent of that, when you see those pictures like that, the citizen, she is the one that's being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6426)|
| 1:47:14| And if you have a heart and concern for these and when you look at those pictures right there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| I don't know what your schedule is, but that looks like that should be given a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Is it a normal practice of your department not to report back to a commissioner when he's asked you to go out and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6446)|
| 1:47:34| and you tell him I will look at it tomorrow and you've not got back with him yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6454)|
| 1:47:41| No, sir, that's certainly not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| So communications does not float as fluently as you may think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| I'm sure there are many problems that we've had with communication, this being only one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| And if I'm the person responsible for that lack of communication, I'll personally apologize right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| What I want you to personally do is to help this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| And if we need to make a motion to send this to the mayor to get back to your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| then I also make that motion today that we make a motion to send this to the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| that he can support the commission in saying that this is resolved as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| I don't know the exact terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Maybe Commissioner Kate has a little more experience than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| But I'm fishing here if anybody has any suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| I guess the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Can we legally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| This is not on our agenda, so we'd have to amend our agenda to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| What I was just talking to Scott about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| public forum is the opportunity for the public to come and speak and to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| voice their opinion about things and get our attention about things, which, you know, this lady has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| I mean, I'll be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| This is the first I've heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| I'll be glad to check with Bruce and see if there's something else that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| Well, as a point of order, if it's not on the agenda, if you make a motion, maybe not at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| if you get a vote of 13-0 to put this on the agenda, can that not be done today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| We've got you want to amend the agenda to put this item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| We have to have two-thirds vote to put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| Or if there's no objections, then it will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Or, well, let's just do a vote and that would be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| So your motion is to send it to the county mayor and expect engineering to give them a week's time to report to the lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6579)|
| 1:49:50| and to the commission and for them to report their findings at the next full commission hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| Well, why don't you just have the mayor put in writing to us, to the commission, by the next meeting, their findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| and what can be done to help Ms. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I would like to have a little advance notice if it's in my district if they pick up the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| and call me as to their finding before all of it, before 30 days is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| I'll make that without putting it in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| You've got a second by Commissioner Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Well, I was just going to maybe try to put this to bed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| Chris, were you aware of this problem yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| I mean, your office may have been, but were you yourself aware of this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Actually, I was on site, I think it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I have met with, actually, James McMillan, who you're familiar with, about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| and spoken with Ms. Cole on numerous occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| And I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| In your professional opinion, what can be done in a month to rectify some of the issues that she has on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6652)|
| 1:51:01| Well, if there's permanent sedimentation, there's nothing that's going to be done in a month on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| I guess the question which remains is, are there controls that need to be in place on site that are not in place now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6666)|
| 1:51:16| From my visual inspection of the site from conferring with the state, TDEC, about the conditions on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| I was told that the site is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| So it's somewhat of a different perspective here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I've been told by a lot of, I guess, fairly knowledgeable sources that proper controls are in place on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| yet the discussion here indicates something vastly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| And so I think I'm compelled to investigate myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| The professionals are telling you that everything is as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| And if that is true, then when we get these types of rains that we're seeing in these pictures right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| then it falls back on the landowner to make certain adjustments to their land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| To a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| And that's not to be dismissed of any way of what's in the pictures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| But there are situations where you can have a lot more rain than the controls are designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6736)|
| 1:52:25| There's nothing we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| But the onus is on the landowner to make corrections following that rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6748)|
| 1:52:43| Does anybody have any other questions for Mr. Grangey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| I'd just like for Ms. Cole to come back up and respond, if she would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6766)|
| 1:52:55| With all due respect, I don't think we've had any rain events this year that are out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| These pictures are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| When we get an inch of rain, when we get a quarter of an inch of rain, it's the same, just more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| I just read today that the runoff is the lowest it's been in 133 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| the driest winter we've had since 1941.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| And I get a little disturbed when I hear Chris talking about the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| as if there's some unusual rain event that caused this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| If you look at the dates, the pictures run from last April to this April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| And the most recent pictures were taken Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Saturday's rain wasn't that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Ms. Cole, since you've owned the property, has it always done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| or are you talking about in the last month or two it started doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| No, this started when they broke ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| The streams were clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| In a heavy rain, it might overflow the banks, but it wasn't orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| It's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I can show you pictures where the construction runoff comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| and it heats up with a freshwater spring from another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| And the delineation where the mud is flowing in is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| I've walked up the stream myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| I can see where it's coming off site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Is this because of his grading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| I mean, if he had grass on it, would it be doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Basically what they've done is they've stripped the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| and what I believe is happening is they've routed the stormwater sewage system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| directly to the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| It doesn't go to the detention structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| So they basically bypassed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| And when you go in and you strip all the vegetation off a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| that's very steep, you pick up volume and you pick up speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| and you take all the dirt with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Yeah, but once you get the growth back, vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| The pipes are still underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| They're still sending the water in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| And when they pave it, you won't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| But I saw those pipes go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| and they're not diverting the runoff to the structures that were built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| to detain the water so that it didn't hit my stream like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| So you say they run them straight to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I believe they do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| So they can't be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| They can't be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| I don't think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| How can we find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| Well, we've got Mr. Ballard's asking the mayor to look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| in a formal complaint, I guess, and to get back with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| and with him within 30 days, hopefully sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| But if there's some kind of violation that we need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| the mayor needs to take action and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Mr. Ballard, if you'll make a motion, I'll be happy to vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| Sorry, I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| What is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I know we voted to suspend the rules or to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| I'm not sure what my motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I think what his motion was is to ask the county mayor to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| get his engineering department to look at Ms. Cole's land to see if there's any violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| and if anything can be done to fix her problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| and then get back with the commission in writing by at least the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6961)|
| 1:56:09| Commissioner Ballard wanted to make sure that the county mayor notified him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| and also Commissioner Huddleston as soon as he has his findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| I guess if I could add one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| if there are violations of any codes that it will be addressed immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| and not at the end of the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Surely to goodness if there are violations of codes, if there are penalties, bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| or whatever they can pull, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I'm sorry, Mr. Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Chris, is that something you can specifically look at, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| what she's talking about where the stormwater runoff is directed into her stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7000)|
| 1:56:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| And sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Just a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Having been involved, unfortunately, in a lot of this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| it looks to me like what may have happened is the original calculation for stormwater runoff was missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| and I don't know if that means it wasn't checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Chris, they have not had the manpower to do that a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| If it was originally calculated wrong, the conveyances to catch it are wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| and it's going to take a major fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| So that might need to be looked at, too, Phil, as Chris and his folks look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| I mean, you may have to go back to the back and start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| I guess, Chris, do you have a site plan that's been approved through the engineering department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| Yes, there is a site plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I guess what I'd like to encourage you, you know, I know this is in Phil's and Jack's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| but I'd like to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Maybe let's go out there and visit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| If you ain't got nothing to do, go out there and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| The pictures we have, it's on her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| I'd like to see pictures that's coming from the property that's being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| If she's got some of those pictures, that would show me where that water's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| We see where it's at, but we need to see where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| So I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| While Ivan's looking at it, the piece of property sits directly behind Sunnyview School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| As you go past Sunnyview School, it's to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| It's real easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| And that's off of Ruggles Ferry Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| If we're all ready to vote, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Commissioner Ballard, we'll get that up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| I'd just like to thank Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I know he's got a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| We want to appreciate you taking the heat there, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| We're on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| We just got to help this lady out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| This is a request of J.D. Robinson-Forizani from A, Agriculture, to R.B., General Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| located on the southwest side of Old Clinton Highway, northeast of Clinton Highway in the commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| Mr. Chairman, I talked to the applicant earlier today because this had been on the agenda for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7149)|
| 1:59:15| He's still not sure as to what he wants to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| He would request, it's a little bit long, but he would request a six-month postponement, if that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| and that's agreeable to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| So we make motion to postpone six months, seconded by Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| Request of S&E Properties-Forizani from A, Agriculture, to PR Plan Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| located on the south side of Balltown Pike, east of St. Gregory's Court in the sixth commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7191)|

| 1:59:54| I also talked to this applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| They apparently could not make their deal go through with the property they were trying to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| They would request this item be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Commissioner Lambert makes a motion to withdraw, seconded by Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| And it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| These are requests of M&M partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| The first is for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from TP Technology Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| and SLPA Slope Protection Area to LDR Low Density Residential and SLPA Slope Protection Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7224)|
| 2:00:30| The second is for rezoning from A, Agricultural, and TL Technology Overlay to PR Plan Residential and TL Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7230)|
| 2:00:38| They're located on the east side of George Light Road, northwest side of Rather Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| east of Pellissippi Parkway in the sixth commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| As stated briefly, there's no opposition to these two matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| There's no opposition to these two matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| And the request for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to the Tech Charter Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| And after hearing that matter, the Tech Charter Board approved the request unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| It was taken before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| And, likewise, at MPC there was unanimous approval of the request for the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7281)|
| 2:01:27| and rezoning it at PR at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| We would request, therefore, approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| It was delayed in response to a request from a constituent in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| And I understand that that person is now notified to the sixth district he doesn't have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| I move we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| This is going to be a great development for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| It's going to fit in really nicely with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| The only opposition to this was another potential purchaser of the property who was more interested in a technology park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7317)|
| 2:02:08| They have since found some other property and they have actually endorsed this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| I think it's going to fit in really nicely with all of the technology in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| It would be a great place for folks to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| For MPC recommendations, seconded by Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Quick question for the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| I noticed that roughly a quarter of the property is a 25 percent slope or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Can you explain how the slope matters are handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7354)|
| 2:02:43| Anyone associated with this can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7363)|
| 2:02:57| The short answer is since this is planned residential, you can, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| clump, for lack of an easier way to describe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| that offer the least involvement with those slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| David Harbin is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| He's with the engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| He can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| I don't know whether you can see it very well from there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| but he can show you how the steeper areas we're avoiding as far as the development is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| David Harbin at 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| Yes, Commissioner Harbin, basically the area that's in the slope protection is a ditch line through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| Our development is clustered over into the area that's more suitable for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| We're basically leaving that ditch line alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| So you're not doing any excavation in the slope protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| We may be doing some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| We're not at the very top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| We'll probably take some of that off to build our building paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| but we're not doing a mass grading in that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| So where you excavate in those areas, how do you remedy that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| What do you do if you cut, and what are you trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| How are you trying to leave it when you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Is there a certain grade that you're trying to not exceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| or is there a ground cover that you're going to put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| What is it that you're going to do to prevent or help prevent excessive erosion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| Well, in this case, basically we're at the top of the drainage shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| So if the ditch is like this, we may take the top portion off, the top five or six feet of that ditch off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| and it won't be quite as steep there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| So it's not a situation where we're filling and creating steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| In this situation, basically we'll probably be taking away a little bit of the steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| And on the lower part, there's a stream protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| Is that what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| That stream will remain in its present state and its present location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| There's nothing going on in a floodway or floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| There's no floodplain on the property, but in the stream area, no, we won't be filling in that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7511)|

| 2:08:18| But I'll go ahead and make a motion we approve it to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Second by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| Discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| I was looking at the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| And it says you're going to join this with two adjacent parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| Are those on the map you're looking at would that be to the left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Because that's a long, narrow parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| It's actually on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| Sir, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Jeff Beckett with Canyon to Canyon 9724 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| This says it's going to be combined with some other development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| And that's on the map here it shows the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I take it that the action taken back in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| and the other hadn't gotten to the map yet, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| I was wondering why that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| I know that there's somebody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| somebody appeared at the NPC meeting had a concern about some flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| in an adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| What's the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| We are working with the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| in the process of putting together a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| The existing property now has a ditch cut along the whole property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| so the whole property flows to this ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| and then goes into this adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| We are looking at putting a detention basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| and eliminating the ditch along the whole backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| In other words, this is supposed to, in fact, improve the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| I haven't received any calls about it, and that person is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| So in the zoning, it's within the parameters of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| so I have no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| I guess I just want to make sure that these flooding issues are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| And I'm a little gun shy, let me tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| because we had a situation here a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| where there was a sight distance problem on Bob Kirby Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| The next thing I know at NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| they've granted a variance from 300 feet to 189 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| and the people feel like that they basically got screwed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| because they were under the understanding that in our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| that we said that these sight distances were going to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| So I guess I'm gun shy now because I'd like some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| to make sure that this drainage problem is going to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| and that after we leave here and subsequent meetings are held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| then all of a sudden these things kind of go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| So do we need some language here to strengthen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| or do we just go ahead with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| And I'm looking for some guidance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| The concept plan has not gone through the complete process at NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| There is a preliminary plan before NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| We will make that issue known as we review the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| How do we know that NPC is going to make sure that this issue is taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| making them aware of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| But I guess, again, I'm gun shy because the NPC did a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| on this sight distance from 300, I believe, to 189.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| And, you know, the people who were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| they wanted to come before the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| but they were just basically told, you know, you're wasting your time, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| So they didn't want to spend the $100 because they thought it was going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| And in the meeting here, they were assured that that sight distance was going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| So I guess that's why I'm saying now we have a drainage issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| I just want to make sure that it's going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| We will make sure that all the pertinent regulations are followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| as they proceed with their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| In other words, with regard to drainage, grading, flooding, the whole bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| we'll make sure that those, that's whatever regulations we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| they're adhered to as it relates to approval of a sight plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| I just want to get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| So we're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Mr. Law Director, who can grant these variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| What variance is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| It was on sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| The variances to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Those are variances that can be approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| They're not zoning variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| They're variances to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| Which we have no control over any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| Is there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| Yeah, we had legislation buzz or a court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| I know we've had both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| I forget which was the most instrumental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| I'm going to rephrase the question, so I'll make sure I give you hopefully the good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| As far as this body no longer having jurisdiction over subdivision appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| We had both litigation and I think Tennessee code may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8000)|
| 2:13:28| I don't have the code section in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| Am I right about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| I know that it was recently, there was recently some litigation that was filed on part of a city plat that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8012)|
| 2:13:41| I believe the result of that litigation was that the city council did not have the jurisdiction to review appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8021)|
| 2:13:48| that it had to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| Back about in 2000, I think it was as late as 2001, there was state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| The county at that time opted to pull out of the legislate or the law that required any appeals to go before the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8036)|
| 2:14:07| City council stayed in that and they did not pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| But this recent litigation for a plat in the city affirmed that the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| and legislative bodies do not have the prerogative to review appeals of subdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| That is something that goes to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| So instead of being something like this important going before an elected body, it goes before an appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8071)|
| 2:14:41| Appointed, not the professional because the staff in the appointed body gets to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| We've got a motion on the floor to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8093)|

| 2:14:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| And the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| Request of NADC for rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| The property is located on the north side of Babley Road, northeast side of Happy Acres Drive in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| Seeing no opposition, 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| I make a motion to approve for recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8118)|

| 2:15:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| And the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| These are requests of Michael Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| The first is for northwest county sector plan amendment from LDR low density residential to MDR medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| The second is for rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| They're located on the northeast side of Snyder Road, north of Hayes Lane in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Seeing no opposition, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| What's the density on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| 6.5 is what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Or what was approved by MPC, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| I'll make a motion we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| For MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8164)|

| 2:16:06| It's set at 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070416?start=8166)|
